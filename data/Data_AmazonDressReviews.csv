0,Jo Anna Penley,3.0,the United States ,"November 30, 2022","Strange material, OK fit","The fabric was kind of stif and scratchy. It fit OK but wasn't as flattering as I was hoping. I ordered an XL, typically 14/16 size. Ended up returning."
1,Jodi Lavin,3.0,the United States ,"November 19, 2022",Blue dress,The product was great. The only problem I had was the delivery man left the items on the ground next the Amazon box I have.  It should be in the box. People steal packages.
2,Tara L Rebele,3.0,the United States ,"October 23, 2022",‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs a cute bathrobe‚Äù,"Review for the white version. Extra star for being lined. Cute I‚Äôm theory but when you ask your husband what he thinks and the response is ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a cute bathrobe‚Äù instant return. The tie waist, long sleeves and with the almost waffle like fabric and yep it does resemble a bathrobe. Hopefully other colors read better but the white, not so much."
3,Samuel Audio,3.0,the United States ,"September 12, 2022",Cute - I'll wear to work,"Dress is okay.  I'm 5'0"" 102 lbs.  Dress is cute, but very casual, sweater-like.  A bit big, but the belting gives a waist.  Originally bought for an homecoming event, where it would be cool, but this was way more casual than expected.  I'm keeping cause it will be a great winter work-office dress, and the price point is ok.  If you are petite, it is thick sweater, nice and cozy, but not for the figure flattering look in the pictures."
4,Cris,3.0,the United States ,"October 22, 2022",Color is off but dress is good,"The color is more magenta than burgundy :( The material is also somewhat thin, so it works in temperatures above 60 degrees. Otherwise, a good casual dress."

6,Chelsea McConnell,3.0,the United States ,"October 15, 2022","It‚Äôs plain, not flattering","It‚Äôs plain, not much flatter to it. Stretchy for sure. Appropriate for church. I wanted it for a family thanksgiving party but wasn‚Äôt flattering enough for the occasion."
7,Maria Oratelli,3.0,the United States ,"September 26, 2022",Pretty & flattering but‚Ä¶,Material was thicker than expected. That‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing but there‚Äôs just a lot of fabric and this is not what I was looking for. It‚Äôs a more reserved look. I returned it for something a little more sexy.
8,Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States ,"September 27, 2022",It‚Äôs not a wow but it‚Äôll do.,Not a wow dress given the material but I‚Äôll keep it for a just in case I have a funeral or impromptu office meeting type dress.
9,Karen L.,3.0,the United States ,"October 15, 2022",Too large and thin,"The dress was very thin, too large and too long."
10,a,1.0,the United States ,"November 6, 2022",Thin/Cheap Looking,"Material was super thin, so it was almost see through in the light. It felt and looked incredibly cheap. Also it smelt really perfumy and was delivered in a clear bag, so it was like it was returned immediately and delivered to me ü§¢"
11,Jessica Trout,1.0,the United States ,"December 1, 2022",Just no,The dress itself was fine great even. The one I received however smelled like smoke so bad it made me sick. The washing instructions are to rinse with water.
12,IHGSH,1.0,the United States ,"August 11, 2022",Shows every lump and bump,"The fabric is much thinner than I was expecting, shows back fat that I didn‚Äôt even know I had. I got it in black and it was sheer, you‚Äôd have to wear something under it, Spanx for sure. Quality far less than expected. Smells awful too, you‚Äôd have to wash it before wearing it. The snap to show less cleavage is nice. If the fabric was thicker it would be perfect, it is a flattering cut. As it is it just looks cheap and isn‚Äôt flattering at all."
13,Patrick Etheridge,1.0,the United States ,"October 31, 2022",Cheap fabric. I was disappointed with this purchase.,The fabric is so cheap looking and very thin.
14,Yvette,1.0,the United States ,"November 11, 2022",NOT DRESS IN PHOTO!!!,NOT dress in photo!!
15,Britney,1.0,the United States ,"September 9, 2022",It‚Äôs unflattering both the fit the sheerness,Unflattering very sheer and the fit is weird. This dress shows ever little flaw
16,Stella,1.0,the United States ,"April 7, 2022",Cheap / Poor Fabric,"Didn‚Äôt even try on! The dress was stuffed into bag, not folded. The fabric was of very poor quality.  It appeared to be a returned item, the cardboard that the dress should have wrapped around was bend and also jammed into the plastic bag.  Would not recommend."
17,gail dellafave,1.0,the United States ,"August 27, 2022","too shear, cheep and I want to return it","flimsy material, would never wear it Dont bother"
18,Amazon Customer,1.0,the United States ,"March 22, 2022",Ew.,I ordered a dark khaki color. It is actually brown. Just ... Disgusting. It looks like a grandma's sofa. Maybe that's on me for trying to get a khaki color.
19,Oriana,1.0,the United States ,"January 13, 2022",Fabric is way too thin,This material is way too thin to wear in public.  Also the small was large on me
20,Andrea ,4.0,the United States ,"December 2, 2022",Flattering but thin material,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4, 134 lbs, and usually wear a 4/6.  I got the small and it fits great with my curvy figure. I got it in the blue gray color and it looks pretty close to the picture. The material was thinner than I thought so I‚Äôd imagine lighter colors might not be as forgiving. I love that it has a snap so that there isn‚Äôt too much cleavage so I‚Äôm hanging out like most wrap style dresses, but it‚Äôs enough to still make it sexy. I ordered it for formal night on a cruise and know it will pack well and not get wrinkled."
21,Joce B.,4.0,the United States ,"November 4, 2022",Very flattering!,"I am 5'3"" about 140lb. I was very skeptical when I opened this up and saw how long it was. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I put it on - it is super flattering, cinches the waist just right and falls around mid-calf for me. I got a medium and feel its perfect, could easily wear leggings, tights, shapewear underneath and feel comfortable. Can't wait to wear this with boots and pairs nicely with a cute jacket! Docked one star because I thought it would be a little bit thicker, or at least a solid material. I do not think it is see-through, but if pulled tight enough it could be. It has the ribbed material that is just that tiny bit sheer when stretched. Overall I would recommend and am considering getting this in another color!"
22,Twin monkey,4.0,the United States ,"December 1, 2022",Awkward fit,"Trying it on, the to fits great, the bottom hem looked squared and awkward, kind of like a robe. Definitely need a butt to fill the dress out properly."
23,McIntosh,4.0,the United States ,"December 2, 2022",Ok to purchase!,This dress was ok to purchase!  It fits good and is made from decent material.
24,mike frost,4.0,the United States ,"November 10, 2022",Pretty dress,I was able to match 3 pairs of shoes/boots in my closet to wear with this comfortable dress
25,jan,4.0,the United States ,"October 25, 2022","Dress is modest,nice color, Fit better for Slim frame.","Dress is nice length and style. However if one is overweight, the bumps will show without shape wear. I like comfort so unsure if will wear, Need a jacket to hide in.  I am 5'8' and 160 lbs. Great dress if one is slimmer."
26,georgia c.,4.0,the United States ,"October 13, 2022",Runs a little large I‚Äôll probably exchange,Runs a little larger
27,tiffb,4.0,the United States ,"February 14, 2022",Very flattering,"This is a great simple dress. I usually wouldn‚Äôt order something form fitting but took a chance due to the waist detail and draping. I ordered a large in the burgundy color which was true to the pictures. The material is similar to a light jersey knit which I wasn‚Äôt expecting but it didn‚Äôt take away from the dress.For tighter Amazon clothing I always order a large. For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù, 140, short torso, carry my weight in my midsection, small B cup size but wide chest, minimal hips or backside, and have legs built like an old soccer player (bigger thighs and calves). I usually wear a 6 in old navy jeans or a 9 in juniors.It fit great without making me feel uncomfortable or self conscious once I had shapewear on. I‚Äôve had a lot of operations that have left a lot of lumps and bumps in my midsection and this dress concealed all of them. I did take off one star because the button/clasp at the chest was missing one side however I would have removed them anyway and used a safety pin."
28,Mfro,4.0,the United States ,"July 4, 2022",Great dress!,I got this dress for my sons wedding. It covered everything I wanted covered yet was not frumpy. I did get the small and it is a bit big but it did not make a difference. Lots of compliments.
29,Amazon Customer,4.0,the United States ,"June 28, 2022",Cute but thin material,"This dress is very cute and flattering, however, the material is very thin which made me a little nervous."
30,"Rachel

Rachael",1.0,the United States ,"June 15, 2022",Super See-through,"I decided to purchase this dress because of all the wonderful reviews and images- it looked like a really pretty dress for a wedding guest! I was more than disappointed when I took it out of the packaging and tried it on. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just an issue with the ‚Äúpink‚Äù color, but it was VERY see-through, even wearing the sheerest underwear. The front was ok but once you turned around, everything was on display! I ordered a size small and medium to try both on for size. The small worked for me and was true to size, however, it was missing the belt it was supposed to come with! I‚Äôm not sure if the quality has gone down since this dress has become popular, but it definitely doesn‚Äôt look like how it does in most of the photos. Thin, wrinkly, and missing items."
31,Brittany Pruitt,1.0,the United States ,"November 12, 2022",Super cheap material,The dress just isn't the same shape or material as the pictures. It was really boxy. I never wore it just tossed it in the donate box incase someone else can get some use from it.
32,Janine,1.0,the United States ,"June 23, 2022",Don't waste your time!,"I was SO excited to try this dress based on the reviews! I chose the pink and couldn't wait to wear it to a wedding this weekend. WOW was I disappointed! The dress is horrifyingly see-through.. I can't post a pic because it's not remotely decent. My boyfriend exclaimed ""oh WOW you can't wear that!"" when I tried it on to show him how see-through it was :/On top of that the fabric is C H E A P--it looks beautiful in the photos, but it's really just a shiny cotton. The dress arrived with snags, and there aren't even beltloops for the belt! So, so disappointed. I don't know how other people are wearing this dress to weddings. Returning this ASAP!"
33,Kristen Nitka,1.0,the United States ,"November 16, 2022",Not what was pictured,I ordered this dress for a fall wedding because it had a sleeve.  Dress that came was sleeveless.  Returning.
34,Victoria,1.0,the United States ,"July 14, 2022",Don‚Äôt waste your money,Very over priced for the quality. Price point should be more around $15. Dress is a step up from swimsuit material and is see through. For my dimply/ cellulite honeys.. this dress is a magnifier! You will absolutely want shapewear. For the very few pros it does fit well and as expected. Bummer that the quality doesn‚Äôt line up with the photo Amazon provides. Will be returning. For ref I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 150 pear shaped
35,Jordan shellabarger1,1.0,the United States ,"June 18, 2022",Cheapy made and came with stains,"This dress feels so cheap and it came with white stains on it despite it apparently new. The quality control for this dress is very poor and DO NOT buy if you are relying on it for a dress. Luckily I bought another dress and the event is weeks away or else I would be completely screwed. Yes, the dress is stretchy, but it also very thin material so it is not flattering at all angles depending on where you hold more fat."
36,Hitefin,1.0,the United States ,"July 6, 2022",Pink is very sheer.,I just received this for a wedding. Excited. Tried it on and in a dark closet could see my crack from across the room. ü§£. The dress would definitely be needing a slip of some sort. It would benefit from having a double layer of material. Everything will be exposed besides the layer that lays over your stomach. Sizing up or down wouldn‚Äôt have mattered in this case.

38,Jessica Justinger,1.0,the United States ,"September 25, 2022",Terrible fit,Extremely unflattering on my body type! I am rather busty and it just did not accompany my body well. Also not very good quality material used.
39,Erica Cavanaugh,1.0,the United States ,"September 7, 2022",Wish I could‚Äôve enjoyed the dress,"The first dress I received looked great but was dirty from someone else trying on. After asking for a replacement, the wrong dress was sent. Pretty poor customer service and product quality"
40,Amazon Customer,1.0,the United States ,"November 13, 2022",Color bleeds!,Beware the black bleeds!! It‚Äôs cheap leather and it ruined my French nails as the black bleeder on there when I tried it on. Not recommend as it‚Äôs cheap.
41,Amazon Customer,2.0,the United States ,"November 3, 2022",Seams ripped,"The dress came with a small rip on the bottom side. I really liked how it fit so I sew it. When I was out, the other side started ripping on the top. I was lucky I had a coat to cover it."

54,Zumbaliz,5.0,the United States ,"October 18, 2022",Super cute!!!,Fits great BUT I didn‚Äôt wash prior to use (I know gross) and the black bled onto my armpits lol but other than that I love it and ready to wear again with my thigh high boots and a denim jacket.
55,Ali,5.0,the United States ,"October 4, 2022",Wow‚Ä¶ just wow!!,"The fact that you can wear this as a Uber, sexy dress, or where it as a pencil dress means it‚Äôs completely versatile in so many ways.For me, it was when I took my boyfriends breath away when I was wearing it as the ultra sexy version! (Picture isn‚Äôt web friendly üòâ)Worth every freaking penny!!!!"
56,Cotton,5.0,the United States ,"October 10, 2022",Love Love Love,"Like I really needed another lil black dress, but I couldn't pass this one up.  I love the versatility of this dress with the drawstring on the side you can adjust the length for the occasion. Great for just about any occasion."
57,Sonjia,1.0,the United States ,"September 5, 2022","Order a size up, thin see through, very wrinkled, dress is plain, color not as vibrant as picture.","I ordered this dress in red based on the pictures and I like wrap dresses. First thank God I ordered a size up just to ensure I had a little room. Amazon recommended a large since I've ordered many dresses now in a large and they fit perfect. I ordered this in XL in red and it fits almost like a medium. Well the red is not vibrant at all, kinda looks like I seriously could've picked this up at Ross stores, and it's super thin, see through material. I just tried it on and looked in the mirror and I can clearly see my  entire panties and outline! Next it's fits super tight in bust (I'm a  40C for reference) and waist area but kinda camoflauges the tummy a little if you're looking for that. I found the ""hidden"" zipper on the right side. It's not worth the price I paid for it, maybe should be marked down to no more than $25.00 and it's so freaking wrinkled it's ridiculous. Also the tie in the back is way longer than the one in the front which is super short, and I can't figure out how to tie it so it looks like the picture. I bought this specifically for an event this coming weekend, but now I'm like ""meh"", a bit disappointed in how it actually looks versus the model wearing it in which it looks all classy and upscale. At this point I may return it and try to find something else altogether, this dress was a huge letdown, huge!"
58,Jasmine,1.0,the United States ,"November 14, 2022",BAD quality,"This dress was way too expensive for what I received. The material itself was very rough to the touch, sheer, and overall bad quality. Sometimes with clothes you buy online you genuinely get what you pay for and can‚Äôt complain, but this dress was so over priced for the product presented. I‚Äôve gotten better name brand dresses at Ross or Marshall‚Äôs for the same or even better prices. Overall, bad dress, poor quality, not flattering at all and definitely not worth the 40 something dollars spent."
59,Connie S,1.0,the United States ,"October 21, 2022",Highly disappointed,"I ordered this dress in black (xl) and the fit was so great and I looked awesome! So I ordered it in navy (xl) as well and the fit was terrible! It felt like a medium and aspects of the dress were off, like the zipper was on the opposite side from the black one I have. Needless to say I‚Äôm not giving up, I reordered in burgundy let‚Äôs see how that turns out"
60,Hannah,1.0,the United States ,"October 21, 2022",Bad packaging,It was delivered in a clear zippered bag that had  holes in it (not damaged but just the way the bag was made) so it was delivered with watermarks on it. I live over 30 minutes from a UPS and wasn‚Äôt able to return. Very disappointing. The dress was super cute and the fabric is great.
61,Theresa Hoffman,1.0,the United States ,"October 6, 2022",Cheap.  picture misleading!,"Horrible fabric.  Color completly off.  Underside of fabric faded. Not a good look with the sleeves, you can see the underside when you lift your arms.  Unless you are goig to wear this without ever moving your arms."

65,omar ortiz,1.0,the United States ,"May 15, 2022",Wrong style,"Not even close to what the picture or description shows. Wrong item sent? maybe.. Item modified incorrectly for bigger sizes? Possibly. Definitely not the product that was purchased. Was not a wrap dress. The sleeves were okay. The 2inches of separation between the bust, waist line, and a random ruffle they added. They added some weird looking overlay on the opposite side, the added 2 inches i mentioned cause the side hopes w the over lay look awkward, as if you‚Äôre bulky w hip dips."
66,"Charley, nyc",1.0,the United States ,"July 6, 2022",It took over a month to arrive,"The dress itself is poorly made.  No stretch in the material at all.  I requested to return it and waited weeks for a ""refund label"" only to find out that the cost to return it to China cost just as much as the cost of the dress."
67,Donna S.,1.0,the United States ,"November 21, 2022",Poor quality,This dress is so raggedy and too sheer. It does not look like the picture. The raised areas are very stringy. I thought they would be raised dots but they aren‚Äôt. I am returning this dress. Worst dress I ever bought.

70,AMiz,4.0,the United States ,"November 29, 2022",Pretty dress,"I ordered this dress for my Halloween Witch costume, but to so wear normally. It does run long but I am short. I probably should have sized down."
71,MV,4.0,the United States ,"October 1, 2022",A little tight up top,"I received this dress and immediately tried it on. I realized that although it fit perfect everywhere else, it was a little snug around the chest. I always get a medium or large in things and the large was a little too snug. Will I be returning it it? Yes I will and for a larger size. This was a flattering dress for sure. But for bigger chested women please wear a bra as it does accentuate quite a bit. I am worried that washing it may shrink it too. It feels like 100% rayon.  I didn‚Äôt see any care instructions so I‚Äôm deducting one star. But I love all the variety of colors to choose from."
72,B. Peters,4.0,the United States ,"October 10, 2022",Nursing friendly!,"I ordered this dress in the lighter blue, green, and apricot colors. My daughter said the apricot one looked like a tablecloth on me (it looked so good on others online!) and the blue one looked like pajamas. The green looked pretty on me, but just a bit too fancy for just going to church. The functioning buttons were what really made me want it, in case I ever have another baby. I love wearing dresses, but you can't wear most dresses while breastfeeding your baby. I ended up returning it for a more casual green dress."
73,Janna,4.0,the United States ,"October 24, 2022",Great family picture dress,I purchased this dress as an option for fall family photos. The dark green color is nice but the ‚ÄúSwiss dotts‚Äù are about the size of a quarter and are shaggy looking.
74,Susan,4.0,the United States ,"October 17, 2022",Very long,It is very long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and it was to my feet. I had to shorten it into a midi. My daughter is very tall though and it is great for her as is.
75,Heather,4.0,the United States ,"September 7, 2022",Larger Swiss dots than expected,"This is a pretty dress and I liked wearing it. Bought the green. Got compliments from friends. I am 5‚Äô2 around 135-140lbs and I got a medium. Fits great. The only complaint I‚Äôd have is that the Swiss dots are much bigger in person than the picture shows. I wasn‚Äôt expecting that. It‚Äôs fine tho and I‚Äôll continue to wear it. Also, I‚Äôm not large chested so it was a tad bit loose in the bust area."
76,Catalina Isaza de Toro,4.0,the United States ,"September 24, 2022",Pensaba devolverlo. Me lo qued√©. Me lo han admirado,"Me agrad√≥ su toque bohemio.Tengo una gran barriga, pero se me ve razonablemente bien , ajustado a la cintura.Me lo voy a seguir poniendoCreo que me est√° gustando."
77,LolaPi,4.0,the United States ,"November 29, 2022",Great fit,"This dress fit as expected, but was not flattering on me."
78,D. M. Bean,4.0,the United States ,"September 18, 2022","Not perfect, but still pretty","When I ordered this dress there were only a couple of reviews and I really struggled as to what size to order.  I felt the size chart was a little contradictory considering the measurements given for the model.  I was concerned that a Medium would be too large in the bust, but I didn‚Äôt want the elastic to be too tight, so I ordered the Medium.  It‚Äôs possible I could have gone with a Small, but the Medium fits fine.  I have included photos of the Medium dress with a tape measure, so hopefully that will be of help to others on the fence.The length is good on me (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù) and it comes to my ankles without shoes on.  It looks good with sandals or boots.  Nice and flowy and feminine.I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the waistband.  It tends to bunch on me and I feel the need to keep tugging it down into place.  Also, the dots on my waistband go crooked, which cheapens the look a little.  I think it may look better with a belt.  I have included photos of it with a belt I had, although I don‚Äôt particularly like the color with the red dress.  I just wanted to give an idea of what it would look like with a belt.  Maybe I‚Äôll get a brown belt to go with it‚Ä¶The sleeves are very full.  The elastic at the wrists is loose on me, but it does allow me to push the sleeves up to ¬æ if I want without it being tight or uncomfortable.  The buttons on the front are real, working buttons, which makes it very easy to get on and off.  Hooray!  The fuzzy dots look a little raggedy where they ended up on the neckline, so I think I‚Äôll try to just trim those areas up a bit and it shouldn‚Äôt be noticeable.Overall, a nice, pretty dress.  Not my first pick in my closet, but I know I will enjoy wearing it."
79,Bingo,4.0,the United States ,"October 9, 2022",Fall Comfort!,"What a great dress for fall! I am 48 years old, 5 foot 6 inches and weigh 133 pounds. I selected the size small in dark green. The fit of the dress was perfect. This dress has a nice weight to it, just the right amount of flow and room! The elastic waistband is very becoming and shows off the curves nicely! The v neck is of nice, modest design. Overall this dress appears very high end, like it came from a little downtown boutique. I feel very comfortable wearing it out on a date with my other half and to work/church. I paired this dress with nude sandal wedges for a perfect fall look! On top of all this style, this dress is soooooo comfortable. A great edition to your fall wardrobe! No complaints at all."
80,DJ COLONIA,5.0,the United States ,"November 23, 2022",Great Dress!!!,"I don‚Äôt usually do reviews but this will be the first clothing review I ever do. I was pleasantly surprised by this dress. The quality was better than expected and I love the color! The only thing was it was larger in size for me. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and i weigh around 160-165 and usually, Large sized dresses fit me and so that was the size I got originally but when I tried it on, it was too big.

It was flattering on my 25 week baby bump and surprisingly didn‚Äôt pull at the chest, even with my very large chest. 6‚Äô1‚Äù and normally a L/XL and the XL worked great. The design/dots are adorable!"
82,Brittany,5.0,the United States ,"December 1, 2022",I love it so much,BUY THS DRESS! it‚Äôs so beautiful and very flattering! I purchased the forest green and the light blue!

84,Amazon Customer,5.0,the United States ,"November 14, 2022",Great dress!,"It fit as expected. I ordered  a small, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and 121 lbs. It is a little snug around the waist but not uncomfortable, a medium would have been way too big I feel. I love this dress, wore for family pictures. Oh I did trim the little dots at the neck line as someone else mentioned."

90,C.Criswell,4.0,the United States ,"November 16, 2022",Long and comfortable,"I purchased this to get baptized in but decided to wear it afterwards. It's very comfortable and long and fits true to size with some stretch and I love that it has pockets. Eventhough the dress is white it stills covers you but the top part is a little thin and you may need to wear a jacket or appropriate under shirt or bra to have complete coverage. I wld also recommend wearing full underwear like shorts or those full body girdles to help smooth out your silhouette since white can be unforgiving. Honestly, the cost is a little too much for the top part of the dress cld have been a little thicker for better quality but it's still a nice comfortable dress to wear around the house."
91,Macromama,4.0,the United States ,"November 24, 2022",Dress or nightgown?,"It feels like a nightgown - the fabric (nice royal blue) is very soft and comfy like a nightgown - lighter softer feeling fabric than a t-shirt. It definitely needs a belt - looks too much like a nightgown without one. VERY long - will have to hem it 2 1/2 inches so I can wear it with 2 inch heels!  (I'm 5'4"", 140 lbs & generally get a size 12 top because I like things loose. I got a size L and it couldn't be any smaller or it wouldn't fit. Like most things today, it's overpriced for it's simplicity."
92,K8,4.0,the United States ,"October 16, 2022",Great dress for postpartum‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôm 4 months postpartum and still have a slight pooch going on, so I‚Äôve been hating how all my pre-pregnancy clothes fit. This dress fits great and looks great! I got the XS. (5‚Äô3‚Äù, 130lbs). I went with the XS, because I wanted it more fitted in the sleeves, and was worried about the length‚Ä¶ I hate when skirts drag on the floor, and this was just right (a little below my ankles). The shape is fitted around the bust area (34B chest) and then drapes over the pooch area, which is perfect!The only reason I took off a star is because of the price. The fabric and quality of the dress is clearly cheap, and I‚Äôd expect to pay around $20 for it somewhere like Wet Seal. And on that note, I prefer to put a chunky cardigan on, use a belt or long necklace to distract from the cheap look.Overall I do love it though, and unless it falls apart after a couple washes, I‚Äôll say it was mostly worth it."
93,Kumari,4.0,the United States ,"October 3, 2022",I like it,"I don't LOVE it, but I certainly like it. The pattern does a lot to hide my post menopausal paunch, as does the empire waist. It's a forgiving dress in a soft fabric. I like that it is long sleeved and has pockets. More dresses should have pockets. I'm 5'4"" and it is awfully long. That's ok for me because I plan on wearing it to a wedding with heels, but if you are my height or shorter you may want to get it hemmed.What's not so great about it: the dress maker doesn't try at all to match up the fabric pattern with the seams which belies the inexpensive nature of the dress. But for that matter it's not really that inexpensive, I would have forgiven this on a dress of $25 or less, but $35 and above is the cost of this dress - - they could have been more consistent with the quality. Some of the dresses were longer than others even when supposedly the same size."
94,Macaron,4.0,the United States ,"December 4, 2022","soft material, short length",Dress is on the shorter side. I'm definitely standard height and this barely hits my ankle. The material has a great color and is v soft but there are stray threads. 7/10

96,Ann  J,4.0,the United States ,"November 16, 2022",Nice but not for me,"The fabric is very clingy. From the front, it looked good but from  the back, it showed every bump I have. If you‚Äôre a smaller size it probably would look great - just didn‚Äôt on me.  I wish it had."
97,Stephanie G.,4.0,the United States ,"October 25, 2022",Love this dress!!!,I bought the medium and the fit was borderline on needing a large. Decided to stay with the size M because I was worried the large would be too big. This dress has a lot of stretch and is very soft comfortable!! Perfect to dress up or down in!Purchased as dress for a witch costume and I am very pleased that I will be able to wear it for other occasions as well!
98,Rosalie chapman,4.0,the United States ,"November 4, 2022",Soft & comfy,"I wore this dress for a wedding on Halloween.  Love the color , feel , warm . Nice & stretchy.  For my figure. Very flattering. Not made for.  The.height challenge. The material if not done correctly would be hard to hem."

100,Magnolia Lane Essentials,1.0,the United States ,"December 1, 2022",Cheap fabric,Pros:It was fleece lined which would be great if you‚Äôll be wearing itCons:The fabric felt and looked very cheap. I would be embarrassed to wear it. Even to a low key dinner event.The cut was odd and unflattering.The front pieces that drape look like a front cape.The fleece liner caused static while trying on which made it cling to me and not hang properly.Glad this worked for some. Not a fit for me. Will be returning.

First dress I ordered fit but was a bit clingy in hips, snug.  Material was nice, seemed like it was lined inside, and warm, which I wanted.  Noticed a white thread right on the butt area, very noticeable.  Was sewn into the fabric.  Had to return it.  Take 2: re-ordered exact same dress.  Second dress was not the same material, not lined or fuzzy inside, but still nice material.  It also fit a tad looser in hips so that was great.  Not so clingy.  Got many compliments on this dress.

The material is very thick and I like it but it would‚Äôve been too warm.I also think the twist in front is really nice, hides insecurities. But the sash just loops through the twist and hangs loosely. Which I don‚Äôt like. It seems an afterthought. Great price for the dress and it would work for a fall event.

I am a bit on the plus size so I didn‚Äôt set my expectations too high. The first issue I noticed is that it is incredibly sheer. I had a grey bra underneath and could see it through the dress so beware. I was able to get it on over my shoulders fine but pulling it over my chest was TIGHT. Every other part of the dress fit perfectly. The way the dress held the yitties in was like a sports bra‚Ä¶which isn‚Äôt very flattering on a dress like this‚Ä¶

Unfortunately, when I put it on, I realized I just don‚Äôt have the ideal body type for this dress. I‚Äôm short, on the thick side, and large chested. The length fell right around the knee/almost below. It was just an awkward length on me. The top of the arms/armpit/chest area felt tight and it made my boobs look like fat pancakes conveniently placed under a tight dress.

It is made well and the fabric is gorgeous, but if you're petite, you won't have a waist in this, as it literally just looked like I put on a pretty trash bag."

I for the life of me dont understand why manufacturers do that but regardless its still flattering. Bought to wear to a wedding. Just need to find the right shoes to go with it.
142,Amazon Customer,4.0,the United States ,"November 1, 2022",Super cute but big,"I usually wear a L so that is what I ordered.

Normally I am a size small  but I just had a baby so a lot of times I‚Äôve had to order a medium.  after reading the reviews I decided to go with a small. I‚Äôm glad I did it fits perfectly. I‚Äôm a 34C in the chest 5 foot four and about 150 pounds post baby. If I was any bigger in the chest I would need to size up but it is not tight. I have narrow shouldersSo if you are wider in that department I would also size up to the medium. The arm length was great almost a little long. Overall good quality dress I will be keeping this one.
150,SP,5.0,the United States ,"November 16, 2022",Runs Large order a size smaller or two sizes smaller if you have a small chest,This dress came as expected and has nice quality! If you are looking for something flowy this is the dress. Be warned there is not much stretch to the dress but it is a loose fitting style anyway. The fabric was slick but I have no complaints about that. As a small chested lady I highly suggest ordering a size to 2 sizes smaller than your normal size. The dress has a lot of room in it and can hang to long if you don't size down. Other than that it is a nice dress.
151,Nanette Levons,5.0,the United States ,"November 15, 2022",I feel pretty,"I love this dress. It is very flattering. Often if I buy a dress with this type of bodice it doesn't fit right and isn't full enough. This was cut perfectly for me and makes me feel beautiful. Going up a size doesn't always help when you are full bust, it's all about the cut. Love this dress.  My only thing is I wish the fabric could be something that doesn't need to be ironed but for this fit I'll take it. Love it."

It has a very low cut neckline that was saggy on me. The fabric has no stretch. Although the fabric print looks nice in the pictures, in real life the peachy color of the background was too close to a creepy skin color in a very unflattering way with my skin."

The only exception is the bust area is really baggy. I am a 34D and the fabric just hung in a strange manner.

Admittedly, I can‚Äôt complain about the color or the fit (since I'm not a small person and it is sometimes hard to find clothing that fits correctly), but it could use a tiny bit of help. The sleeves would be better as quarter sleeves (rather than full arm length) and the skirt (behind the rouching feature) either needs to be longer, or the slit needs to be affixed to the skirt so it doesn‚Äôt come open when you‚Äôre walking. I‚Äôd also like to see either one piece of fabric for the dress, or some kind of belt to cover the elastic midsection where the top and the skirt are sewn together. Otherwise, I don‚Äôt hate this."

I got the red with the gold polka dots, I think it‚Äôs perfect for the winter holiday season/Chinese New Year. The length is great, sits just above the knees. The sleeves have an elastic on the end so it‚Äôs never too long on anyone. The fabric is not prone to wrinkles which is great. Easy care, just toss in the washer in cold water and air dry. I recommend washing it inside a laundry bag. At $37, I think it‚Äôs a decent value."
222,Brenda Marie,4.0,the United States ,"August 4, 2022",VERY pretty - almost fits me well - trouble with fitting my bust...,"VERY pretty - almost fits this tall girl well - trouble with bust...This is soooo pretty ‚Äì especially in person.  I am not one to buy clothing off of Amazon ‚Äì or almost anywhere online really as I like things that fit and decent quality as well.  I was pleasantly surprised by this ‚Äì as again it is pretty gorgeous in person and seems to be made pretty decently.I ordered the XL as I am a 6-foot-tall woman and I was afraid it would be VERY short and I might have to wear shorts or something.  And yes, it is short (babydolls are supposed to be), but surprisingly it was not micro on me.  I could totally wear this out and not feel my butt was exposed.  (Although I would probably wear a pair of yoga shorts just in case ‚Äì but that is me.)The issue I have is that the lining is not too flowy on me and tends to ride up a bit ‚Äì so maybe my butt is sort of being exposed a bit. Ha ha ha. Eventually anyway.  : )  Also, I have a naturally large chest and I will say putting this on over my head (and getting it back off) was a bit of a challenge with my bust.  It is snug there ‚Äì on me anyway ‚Äì especially with the waistline getting it over my bust.The outside material really does flow and flounce pretty well ‚Äì but it is not hanging off of me all swingy like the models in the listing ‚Äì as true babydols are supposed to.  But again ‚Äì I am not teeny.  It does have a bit of flow and definite flounce to it, though.  Personally ‚Äì especially with the bust ‚Äì I would have preferred to go up a size for a much looser and freer true babydoll look.  But again ‚Äì it does look so pretty on me.  Especially after I paired it with some beautiful blue heels I just got.  Way more than casual looking paired with the right shoes and bag.I hope that you have found my review ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù. : )  Enjoy your day! : )"

However, it was just too big for me. I ordered a medium which is what I‚Äôve been wearing these days, I‚Äôm a size 4 which the sizing chart does say is a small but my measurements per the sizing chart say I‚Äôm a medium,  but this was just a bit loose on me. Also the arm sleeve was extremely baggy, looked weird. I think that‚Äôs why the model has the sleeve scrunched up to her elbow. That‚Äôs the only way to make it look right. I loved the color and the material wasn‚Äôt bad. It was like a thick spandex. My dress did not have any kind of lining which other reviewers have mentioned. Maybe if I would have ordered the small the dress would have looked better on me? Unfortunately I will have to return and wear something else to the wedding, I ran out of time to get the smaller size."

There was only a couple of things I would work on with this dress and that was 1. Material was a bit thin‚Ä¶ not see through at all but just thin‚Ä¶ glad I wore bike shorts underneath or every extra curve or blemish would have shown. It worked out fine with the shorts though so not upset at that! 2. It would gape slightly in the front and ride up if walking or dancing even for a short period of time‚Ä¶ I had to keep pulling the bottom part down or re-tying the wrap area. Overall not upset at this purchase and it did the job and did look great I just wasn‚Äôt 100% comfortable the whole night.

245,Debra Davis,2.0,the United States ,"September 27, 2022","Eh, not for shorter people.","I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 & this dress fit too big & too long. The color was super cute but the proportions were completely off, I went off of my measurements to order the size & the part that was supposed to be at my waist was at my crotch, & instead of it being just above my ankles it was trailing on the floor!"
246,Ashley ,2.0,the United States ,"August 29, 2022",Bust fit weird,"I bought my typical size which was much too tight, I sized up as others were saying and the bust fit strange. The dress also had some pretty obvious deodorant stains on it so it had previously been been tried on and no one cared to inspect it before shipping it to me.Overall the dress would have been beautiful but the bust would have needed altered which for the price wasn‚Äôt worth it to me."

251,Angie,2.0,the United States ,"August 24, 2022",Just okay,This dress arrived with a hole in the seam. Which I understands happens from time toTime. The royal blue color was gorgeous but unfortunately sold out in my size to exchange.

The details across the stomach are such a great addition to this dress HOWEVER, this pink dress was see through in the back and because it is more of a fitted dress you could see any extra garment underneath the dress."
253,Melissa S.,3.0,the United States ,"August 20, 2022",Cute! For someone that isn‚Äôt me,"It was too small - size up if you‚Äôre an in-between size person like me.

260,Julie Garcia,4.0,the United States ,"November 22, 2022",Great dress,"I initially ordered a large, but the chest was too small. I‚Äôm a 40DD had to return it and get the extra large dress. It fit perfectly a little big around the waist but there‚Äôs enough room to enjoy that extra dessert.  The fabric is really nice. It‚Äôs not cheap for the price.  The only drawback is the belt. There are no loops to fit the belt so once you tied the belt it would slip down I had to take it in to get it altered but it‚Äôs gonna be worth it because it is a really pretty dress.I purchased the deep red. It‚Äôs a beautiful color and will be perfect for my Christmas party."
261,ReadWriteYoga,4.0,the United States ,"November 18, 2022","Wow, a nice surprise!","Wow! This dress is lovely for the price. It‚Äôs not terrific quality but for the price it‚Äôs lovely and assuming I hand wash it I expect to get several wears from this dress.The deep, teal blue color is lovely, I ordered the small. It fit well but An extra small would have been perfect. Like others have stated, the belt tends to slide off since there aren‚Äôt any loops to hold it in place. It‚Äôs still lovely though & I love the open shoulder style.I never buy clothing from Amazon and I‚Äôm happy with this purchase."
262,SK.atx,4.0,the United States ,"December 5, 2022",Gorgeous! BUT very big if you're petite,"I'm 5', 100 lbs, 34D and unfortunately the small was waay too big for me. The small is like a size 6-8, nowhere near a 2-4.Bummer, it felt like satin-y butter, it looks super high quality, and it is true to color. If it'll fit you, get it!"
263,Maria,4.0,the United States ,"November 21, 2022",color rubbed off on iron & jacket,"Bright beautiful color, but I did notice the color rubbed off a bit the first time I wore it. (I wore it without washing it first) idk maybe that‚Äôs why. The fit was okay, didn‚Äôt flatter too much. The pic online looked as if the dress would b more flattering. It was cute but didn‚Äôt wow me personally. It fit me a little big"
264,Tracy,4.0,the United States ,"November 3, 2022",Bought this for a wedding,"This dress is very nice for the money you spent. For me, it was a bit too short. The photos make it look like it is a longer dress and it is not. It is definitely more of a knee length dress. I love the dress though, so I‚Äôm actually planning on purchasing another one and having it altered so it is longer. I think it‚Äôll be beautiful. Although it is not an expensive fabric, it actually is very elegant looking and with a couple tweaks it will be very pretty."
265,Experiment 626,4.0,the United States ,"November 10, 2022",Not as long as I thought it'd be,"The color is beautiful. It's just not as long as I thought it would be. I was hoping it hit me around the top of the ankle, but instead it hit me just under the knee. I'm 5'7."
266,Rianna S. Hansen,4.0,the United States ,"October 6, 2022",Quality varies by size,"I am 5ft9, 185-190 pounds, and an H cup. I ordered this dress in a large (blue) and an XL (black). The XL fit better, but the neckline was too chunky and the ruching did not lie well. I also thought it was weird that the dresses were shipped in different bags with different logos.The nice thing about the dress is the elastic around the bust on the strapless side. It doesn‚Äôt cut in and hides your bra."
267,Mdor,4.0,the United States ,"September 12, 2022",Beautiful Guest-of-Wedding Dress,"I loved this dress so much as a guest of a wedding. The green color is rich and the shape of the dress is very flattering and feminine. The one underarm of the dress is stretchy so it's comfortable, but there is no ribbon to hang the dress properly. The dress also ironed very well and did not wrinkle while it was worn. I also liked the sash as an added accessory, but there are no loops for the sash, so it fell off a bunch of times until I just put it in my purse. It still looks good without it, but I would have liked it better if the sash could have been better secured. Overall, highly recommend."
268,naomi,4.0,the United States ,"August 29, 2022",Beautiful dress,"Something was not right with the side stitching.  Looked like there was a pocket.  The dress fit BUT with my hips it just wasn‚Äôt the look I was going for.  I had high hopes for this dress bc I planned on wearing it to an upcoming wedding in October.  Overall wasn‚Äôt a fit.  Maybe if you are slimmer than me then it would look phenomenal.  I thought that perhaps if I had gotten it in another color it would look nice but I think it‚Äôs my body type.Sadly I will be returning it.  Back to the drawing board sighMy stats are 190lb, 5‚Äô4, cheat 33inches, hips &butt 45-47 inches.  I‚Äôm smaller up top and larger on bottom.  (Purerto Rican for you lol)"
269,Corinne,4.0,the United States ,"April 28, 2022",Nice Dress,"The dress was nice, and I absolutely LOVED the color - it fit a bit too big on top however.Here are my stats: pant size 4; 36 C; I bought a medium...Despite being a tad big on top, the dress looked nice and I received compliments on my dress, so no one noticed that it was loose on top other than me. All good. The other tiny inconvenience is that there wasn't a hook/eye clasp at the top of the side zipper. It would have been a lot easier to zipper up by myself if that was included, but, eh it was a $30 dress... What are you going to do?I did, however, have a problem in how my package was delivered. It arrived in the 'zip-lock' style bag. Normally when I order from Amazon, the clothing bag (with zipper top) is secured in a packaging bag of some sort, this was not the case with this package. It was just the flimsy clothing bag with a shipping label slapped on it which wouldn't have been so bad I suppose if they had secured the zipper portion of the bag. So basically, anyone could have opened the bag, taken out the dress (for whatever reason) or it could have opened and fallen out completely leaving me with a delivered empty bag. Listen, this might not be a big deal but it was for me. I included photos of the packaging, wish I had thought of taking a selfie with dress on"
270,Missy,5.0,the United States ,"November 6, 2022",Absolutely beautiful dress,"I have never left a review before ever but i simply had to because this dress is worth the effort. I purchased this dress to attend my friend's wedding in September and i do not regret it. I usually wear a large and i bought a large....the fit was perfect as if my seamstress made it for me. It's very sexy yet classy, the material is lightweight but not see through....i got the dark green and the colour is so rich and vibrant. Listen sis just get the dress, i can guarantee you will not regret it. I loved it so much i plan on ordering the black for a christmas dinner. Worth the money"
271,April La,5.0,the United States ,"December 3, 2022",I might buy this in every color!,This arrived today for a wedding I have coming up and this dress is gorgeous on me! It seemed to be a little sheer but nothing the right undergarments can‚Äôt fix and it‚Äôs just in the front. I am looking for reasons buy another three lol!
272,Cynthia,5.0,the United States ,"November 21, 2022",Gorgeous!,Purchased this dress for a wedding and it was perfect! I was impressed with the quality it actually felt like a higher end brand. The color was gorgeous and fit was as expected. I‚Äôm a size 14 in bottoms and large is tops; 36DD and the size large fit perfect. Was afraid to get the xl because I‚Äôm smaller framed up top and couldn‚Äôt afford to shop around if this dress didn‚Äôt work. Would totally recommend!
273,Erica,5.0,the United States ,"November 20, 2022",Body flattering!,"I am rectangle/almost pear shaped and this dress highlights the smallest part of my frame, and conceals my mom belly. I'm 5'3"", 154lbs and wore a medium. Top started to feel a bit snug but nothing too bad. I'm a 32 DD if it helps."

277,Iris,5.0,the United States ,"August 1, 2022",Very flattering,"A perfect dress for a hot summer day. I loved the color, it was as expected. I also loved how soft it felt and liked that it didn't wrinkle up at all and it absorbed my perspiration- It was a hot day and I was worried about it,  so that was a relief!).Not sheer at all. Does not give in, so choose wisely. I am 5.9 and about 180 lbs. and got an XL because I needed room for the bust and can tailor it if needed but ran out of time. It was a perfect fit from the bust but it lifted the waist. I felt it went too high for my liking. (It could have been from the volume on my bust) As you can see in the picture, the waist wrap was at my waist but the dress was higher and that bothered me. At the hips it felt a little loose but didn't mind that. I was confident the dress looked good on me. I was able to walk comfortably without worrying about the front opening too much, too. I got many compliments that special day where I was a guest to a wedding which was held outdoors in the hot weather and a sweet 16 which was inside.I don't think a large would have fit. I will buy again with enough time to tailor it."

This one was too big in the shoulder and hung in the arm pit area. It was also too big in the waste. Length was fine. I had it tailored to fit me perfectly and I am SO happy with it! Very flattering"
282,A. Reader,4.0,the United States ,"November 18, 2022",Great fit!,"This dress is very cute and does look as pictured. It‚Äôs very stretchy, making it a very nice fit. The material is very comfortable. It‚Äôs not the same velvet on the inside, it‚Äôs just a stretchy, basic material. But like I said, it‚Äôs very comfortable! I had hoped it would be more flattering; like make my booty look nice or have more coverage around the stomach. But I‚Äôm sure with the right body, this dress would be poppin! I did wash and dry, on normal which I didn‚Äôt actually want to do lol, but it came out pretty much exactly how it went in! So bonus points for that! Lol definitely not an expensive looking dress, but a good basic staple piece to have in your wardrobe. So overall I would recommend. :)"
283,Khalena Fields,4.0,the United States ,"October 4, 2022",Great evening gown,"I love this gown! The feel is amazing, the split is sexy but still classy and there is a drawstring where you can gage ur highness of the split! And it‚Äôs long enough. I do recommend this evening dress!"
284,Jazznupe,4.0,the United States ,"August 20, 2022",Wife thinks it is flattering,"The wife likes this dress and tells me that she thinks it is very flattering.  It feels and looks very soft and luxurious.  It is definitely comfortable.  I think it hugs her curves in a very exciting way.  She said that she would wear this to a black-tie affair or a wedding.  At 5'7"" the dress ends right at her ankles.  The slit stops just at her knee level.  To top off this dress, she would accessorize with a great pair of heels and a chunky necklace.  She feels great in this dress.  This dress does not have tummy controls so you may need to wear shape wear with it."
285,Clara,4.0,the United States ,"September 5, 2022",Loooovve this,"I bought this dress for an event and it was a great fit for the occasion. The suede was smooth and the dress clung to my curves. My only issue was that it kept riding up. However, it was still a great purchase!"
286,JujubeMBA,4.0,the United States ,"August 23, 2022",Appropriately priced,"This dress is good for its price point. It won't fool anyone as formal wear as it is but for something you can throw on and be comfortable in, this is nice. The fabric has a lot of give, so it hugs your bum and hips. If you're clever with altering or upcycling, you could level this up into a more formal dress. A great base for a very comfortable Halloween costume, a stage costume, or a budget formal gown."
287,Haja Galaxie,4.0,the United States ,"August 18, 2022","So cute, I‚Äôm 110 lbs so a extra small would‚Äôve been better but still fits nice","This is so cute and classy.The velvet feels great and the design is beautiful, it‚Äôs just as picturedI‚Äôm 110lbs & the small fits but it‚Äôs a tiny bit loose which is not necessarily A bad thing with this design because it has more dimension, but I think they should offer a size extra small."

289,Lena Ciborowski,2.0,the United States ,"November 15, 2022",Ugh,"I‚Äôm not typically one to write reviews and talk poorly about an item. I have no problem ordering off Amazon and accepting whatever I can get but I just couldn‚Äôt help myself in this situation. I am 5‚Äô4 and about 126 pounds and this dress had to be one of the most unflattering things I have ever put on. The length of the dress just didn‚Äôt make sense to me, the waistband outlined my stomach in a way that someone would assume I was expecting (which I am not) and the top part someone could look straight down. Mind you I ordered an XS and it still wasn‚Äôt anywhere close to what was advertised but super soft so it had that going for it. Again, it bothers me that I had to write this review but I got it in hopes I could wear it to a wedding and now I‚Äôm back to square one."
290,Jeanie Chang,2.0,the United States ,"November 19, 2022",Zipper placement ruined the dress,"The material is actually quite nice for what you can expect of a dress this price. I think that‚Äôs why so many people love it. But there‚Äôs a zipper that goes all the way down past my hips. I don‚Äôt understand why they didn‚Äôt just end it at the waist. You know how you get that bump on zip up hoodie? It‚Äôs like that on one side of the hip. It‚Äôs all ripple-y. Maybe it‚Äôll look better if I sized up. Definitely, not a dress for someone pear shaped."
291,Jen Young,2.0,the United States ,"October 11, 2022",Too loose around the waist - not for hourglass figures,"For starters, I am 5‚Äô6, 135 lbs, 34‚Äù bust, 27‚Äù waist, 36‚Äù hips and I have a long torso. I normally order a size small or medium in dresses. I have purchased this dress twice, once in a small and again in an extra small, and both times it did not look flattering. The small was like wearing a sheet, and the x-small bunched up around my waist where it was way too loose. I think this dress would be best for people who have more of a rectangular body type, and I think those with more of an hourglass figure should avoid this. In addition, the material is thin and looks cheap. All around a dud."
292,mollie mathis,2.0,the United States ,"October 20, 2022",DO NOT STEAM,"I bought this dress 2 months ago for a wedding this weekend. When it came in, I tried it on and checked for stains, tears, etc. It was perfect! Super flattering and comfortable. I put it in my closet and just took it out to steam it and now the dress is ruined! What I first thought was water spots from the steaming turned out to be permanent discoloration! Now the dress is unwearable and no longer returnable. Not sure how I was supposed to get the horrible wrinkles out when this fabric can‚Äôt be ironed either!"
293,Jodi C,2.0,the United States ,"November 21, 2022",Size up for a comfortable fit,The fabric feels very good against the skin but the bust area is a weird fit and I'm normally a large dress size and it was too tight around my hips.
294,Erin Edwards,2.0,the United States ,"September 23, 2022",Fits Funky,I originally purchased a medium per size chart and it was way too small. Purchased a size up and still had fit issues. The zipper feels extremely flimsy and there was buckling once zipped. The fit in the chest then was gaping near the armpits and didn't lay correctly. Suppose it fits fine on zero curves and a flat chest. Returned both sizes. Not bothering with continuing to try ordering another size up.
295,Courtney Hanes,2.0,the United States ,"October 21, 2022",Not for me,"I really wanted to love this dress. It‚Äôs cute and the color is cool, but it‚Äôs just not going to work for me. It‚Äôs a bit too tight and unflattering. This doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt love it‚Äî it‚Äôs just that I didn‚Äôt."
296,Asia,2.0,the United States ,"March 26, 2022",Nice stretchy material but,"Ordered another and still have white and oil stains? Don‚Äôt understand why people wear items and return.  The midi material is much thinner than the split dress material.Got a small because most said to size down from your usual size and I‚Äôm a medium. It fit well and my boobs were set nicely (38c). It does stretch but I didn‚Äôt have any more room (6 or 8 in pants). I have boxers on so I‚Äôll probably recommend seamless underwear. Taking it back because I realized it had stains, gross! The next reason is because I‚Äôm going to an opening and I don‚Äôt want my boobs to be out so I‚Äôll get a medium, but if I was going to brunch or something I wouldn‚Äôt mind! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 and last time I checked I was 173 lbs. However, I‚Äôve been working out for 3 weeks now so my weight is different.. possibly .. I think I lost 5 or 10 pounds üòÇLove the color very bright, complement my skin  and it‚Äôs out of my comfort zone!"
297,klynbrsh,2.0,the United States ,"August 6, 2022",Not worth it.,"This dress was recommended by buzzfeed or something like that. Maybe I got the wrong size but it didn't feel like it fit right. The top part was fine, around my waist it felt too tight and like the seam was a little twisted. I also couldn't use the zipper while the dress was on, luckily it was stretchy enought to get over my head without the zipper. The slit is also on the side not off the front of the dress like the picture showed. Definitely returning."
298,Jennie B.,2.0,the United States ,"October 9, 2022",Loved the dress but came stained,The dress itself was great. Loved the fabric and fit. Only problem was that it came stained. I don‚Äôt know what it is but I‚Äôm just hoping it washes out.
299,Patti Lynn Harmon,5.0,the United States ,"December 5, 2022",Get this!!!,Bought this to wear for an evening wedding. The dress came on time and fit. Material has a little stretch to it. I have a big but so I went up a size just to make sure it fit so it was a little loose in the boob area for me. The straps are adjustable and I just used a little double sided tape to make sure there were no slips.
300,Megan Neighbors,5.0,the United States ,"November 14, 2022",Sooo silky sexy!,"I love the quality of this dress! It was so shiny & silky. I wasn‚Äôt planning on wearing a turtleneck and tights/boots with it, but a cold front came through and the wedding was 25 degrees colder than we expected! I ended up loving how it all turned out! I will say, it hugged my stomach where you could see my belly button when I had nothing on under it, so I ordered some shapewear and that helped a ton! Turns out you could kinda see the pantyhose line on my belly as well, but no biggie. I want this in more colors now!"
301,Brianna Clancy,5.0,the United States ,"February 19, 2022",Incredible Dress!,"5‚Äô8, 195 lbs, waist 35 inches, 36DD. Purchased split black in XL.Y‚ÄôALL- I‚Äôve been wanting to hop on board the satin slip dress train for a while, but I‚Äôve been nervous to pull the trigger because it‚Äôs hard to tell on the internet if the satin is decent quality, and because I‚Äôm curvy and self conscious about my tummy.Let me tell you, one pair of spanx and this dress later I felt like a freakin bombshell, which is amazing because I currently have the lowest body confidence I‚Äôve had in years. Husband was drooling.Fabric- this satin is pretty thick and a little stretchy, which was a pleasant surprise. Definitely not see through, and I was able to comfortably sit through a three hour opera. Has a very nice shine, but definitely does not look cheap. The stitching is well done and the straps are STURDY. The zipper should probably be a little more heavy duty, and there is no hook and eye, so I will be adding one in future to help get the zipper up. Once it was zip everything was great, but the satin is slippery so I had to have my husband do the actual zipping while I helped hold the sides together. But for $30? Don‚Äôt even care.Fit- this dress went about 3‚Äù below my knees while standing, and sat just above my knees when sitting.  The waist is very fitted, but the hips allow a lot of space. It was wild, it looked tailored right of the packaging. The bust area fit really well, and the fabric is sturdy enough that I was able to comfortably wear this dress without a bra. The ladies were supported, not squished, and I wasn‚Äôt worried about the nips. The slit is towards the back of the dress, which I didn‚Äôt realize looking at the pictures, but I actually really like it! It‚Äôs just behind my left leg, and when sitting, you might not notice there‚Äôs a slit at all.Note- not sure how this dress would fit on a slimmer body type, because I don‚Äôt have one- the neckline would probably slouch in a really pretty way on a smaller chest like in the pics, but the hips might bag, it‚Äôs hard for me to tell.Just purchased in the rust color as well, this is going to be my go to wedding guest outfit this summer! It rides the perfect line between casual and formal. I cannot believe I got this stunner for such a great price. Buy it!Will absolutely update with photos, unfortunately forgot to get a pic!"

I‚Äôm usually a size 7/8 in jeans, wear medium, and the medium fit great. It wasn‚Äôt see through at all, but was still thin, light-weight fabric.

The color isn‚Äôt what many would consider bone, but I wanted something grayish anyway, so that wasn‚Äôt the problem. The problem was that it fits smaller than it should according to the sizing chart measurements. It was too tight and showed every detail underneath, which I didn‚Äôt feel looked good.

Wore this to a wedding and Got lots of compliments even from the groom and the bride.***I found it very unuasual that theses dresses had no new tags attached to them it appears as though they could have been returned items without the tags.

Just not my style I think."
348,ns,4.0,the United States ,"December 23, 2021",Not for a short person,"Because I'm short, zipper in the back went so low that it bunched right on my but, it looked like I had a bunny tail under the dresser.

The fit is very flattering, and I wore this for our family's photo shoot. It was a very comfortable dress, but because of the material, it may be too hot for summer.

It's incredibly comfortable - you can accessorize it with jewelry, or toss it on with a jean jacket and go to the grocery store.  The quality is pretty good.

368,Athena,5.0,the United States ,"October 22, 2022",Cute & Comfortable,"I used it at a festival and it was perfect. For the dress I selected,  I loved the retro-looking rainbow, the loose draping, and the boxy bottom, which helped cover a few curves and gave it a little bit of style vs a traditional maxi.You likely could go down one size if really would want it tighter. I'm 5'4 and it hung at my ankle, about an inch above my feet. Lastly, the leg split is a bit high running all the way to the knee, if that would affect your decision."

375,Karina,2.0,the United States ,"February 16, 2018","Ok, but not great.","I was super excited when I got this... but then put it on and found a massive hole in the collar. Not a HUGE deal, my seamstress can stitch it right up for $10. So I decided to wash it to make sure it didn't shrink. The tag says wash in 30 degree celsius, but no details on dryer settings. So I washed it in cold water and the water turned DARK BLUE! So it obviously bleeds a lot. I was unsure about the dryer, so I set it on low tumble with no heat. I also put ing some other clothes to help it tumble and dry properly. After an hour, it was still very damp and everything else was dry. So I set it to low heat. Another hour and still damp. I turned it inside out and stuffed a dry towel inside it, then put it back on low heat. An hour later, it was FINALLY dry!I put it on and found it had shrunk a bit. Which would have been ok, because I would have liked it a little snugger - especially in the waist area where it's very loose on me. Unfortunately, the arms shrunk too and barely reach my wrists... I'm 5'8"", tall and slender like the model and this hardly looks the same on me as it does her. I ordered a small and have a 26"" waist and it's very wide around the waist area... to add to it, there's a hole in the collar and now the sleeves are too short... I may return it bc I'm quite disappointed."
376,Styl4mer,2.0,the United States ,"December 2, 2015","The quality is poor, fit is awful and I would not recommend ...","When I ordered this dress it appeared to have sizes. The description (V28¬Æ Women Cowl Neck Knit Stretchable Elasticity Long Sleeve Slim Fit Sweater Dress) had no information regarding size and there was a drop down box to select xs/s and m/l. When the dress came it was a one size fit all. The packaging was awful as it was torn and the dress was half out of the very thin plastic. It is way too big for me and too long. If I knew it was one size fits all, I would not have bought this. Clearly, you can not make one item to fit sizes XS to L. One sticker on the dress said one size fits all and another sticker on the package had an ""s"" (small). So it is really unclear. The quality is poor, fit is awful and I would not recommend at all. The dress does not have any labels, tags or markings on the inside. The packaging is not the same as the picture and there is not one label or tag. I suppose it has no front and back either. I think this is my last experience buying clothes from Amazon. I have had these weird experiences too many times. I never know if I'm buying quality or not."
377,Zaliana Aliana ,2.0,the United States ,"August 9, 2020",Huge if you are truly XS/Petite,"I loved the dress and the fabric is rather nice and warm. It would have been the perfect winter dress but I was so disappointed on how huge it looked on me and getting it fixed was out of the question as it would have to be fixed from all sides- chest, length, armpits, shortened sleeve. It would have been like making a new dress from scratch.I loved the look, style and fabric but sadly it is huge on a truly small petite woman.I‚Äôm a size 2 and it simply was huge and saggy all over the place.I wish they would make an actual XS size because then I would try buying it again."

379,Amazonian,2.0,the United States ,"November 29, 2016","Buy with caution, It was nice looking for less than an hour...","So today was the first time I wore it and I liked how it looked. The sleeves are nice and long on me. I am 5'6"" tall and curvy and the sweater seemed to accentuate my curves. The green color was just as pictured and my husband thought it looked Christmassy. However, less than an hour after I had put it on the right sleeve started to come apart in the stitching at the wrist and unraveled up the sleeve towards the elbow about 8 inches. I am so glad I had brought a jacket because as soon as I saw it unravel I put on my jacket. Definitely not a good thing when its cold outside and you just got the sweater. It actually sucks that it happened as we were out and were heading out to dinner after church.I sent an email to Amazon about the product and I will update the review when I receive a response."

I liked that the open back did not go too low, and the bottom was a good length.  but....the back elastic kept folding out/over (my friend was constantly fixing it for me). Also, the low neck to the bust area is narrow, and I had to readjust it  (pull it up and sides) frequently to stay in place to prevent some exposure. I finally used my scarf over the shoulders and tied it in the front to cover me.  If you are having your hair done, make sure you wear the dress as it goes over your head (no buttons).

405,Shelby Gill,2.0,the United States ,"December 3, 2022",Waist started too high,"For me, the waist line started at the boob on my dress? It took a minute to figure out why the dress was fitting so oddly but even when I was constantly readjusting, I couldn't get that first seam to even touch the underwire of my bra. I'm on 36C and the rest of it was kind of loose so I'm not sure what happened here"
406,Mary Byrum,2.0,the United States ,"December 4, 2022",Poor fit in the bust area,"The dress was beautiful, however, the bust area is not right. It is cut too short causing it to cut across the breast midway instead of under the breast. I was very disappointed and had to return it."
407,Jamie Doll,2.0,the United States ,"November 29, 2022",Does not look like the picture,This dress doesn‚Äôt look anything like the picture.  It is basically just some velvet fabric sewn in a weird way.  Does not look good.
408,paula boggs,2.0,the United States ,"November 12, 2022",Size is WAY off,"Ordered XL, which is equal to 18. There is NO WAY that dress is that size. I couldnt even barely get it over my head, fit like a 12-14. WAY undersized"
409,Jamie Fagan,2.0,the United States ,"October 30, 2022",Disappointed in this.,The fabric is velvet.  The v neck is very high so it‚Äôs not flattering.! Looks more like a medieval Halloween costume than a dress for dancing.
410,OutdoorThorman,2.0,the United States ,"January 11, 2022",Weird length and style,"I'm not sure what it was about this dress but I look like a old granny in it. The length is awkward (above the ankle) and the long sleeves maybe add to the granny look too. It just looks old fashioned. The cross over bust was easy to make non-revealing or revealing depending on where you let it cross over at. Quality was fine, just didn't look good style-wise."
411,Babs,2.0,the United States ,"May 11, 2019",Not at all flattering,"I didn‚Äôt have super high expectations for this dress when I bought it seeing as how inexpensive it was, but I needed a dress for an event in a hurry & didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot of money for something I‚Äôd most likely wear once. It did the trick, but the fit was different from how it looks on the model. I‚Äôm a C cup, & the fabric across the chest was too loose. I tried tacking it down to give it more of the V neck style shown, but it still looked bulky. I purchased a size Medium, & it was a little loose all over. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù 139 lbs, btw. The fabric was heavy, which I expected since it‚Äôs velvet, but I didn‚Äôt think it was the most flattering dress. I felt like I was wearing an old curtain. I donated this to Goodwill after I washed it. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this to anyone."
412,Johanna,2.0,the United States ,"January 31, 2022",Not for plus size,I‚Äôm a 22W and typically have no problem with XXL but this was too small.  Length and hip were ok but very tight in the bodice and arms.  I have to return it. Not to mention it smelled funny‚Ä¶
413,CLF,2.0,the United States ,"December 5, 2021",Lovely material but HUGE,"I got a size small, which according to the size chart page, would fit me well. Yikes. I look like I ordered three sizes too big. But the material is absolutely gorgeous. Thick and luxurious feeling. Wish I could make this work but nothing fits except the length. The green is dark and beautiful."
414,PARANORMAL,2.0,the United States ,"October 22, 2016",WAY TOO SMALL,"ACCORDING TO THE REVIEWS AND SIZE CHART IT SHOULD HAVE FIT ME.  I DID READ ONE THAT SAID THE ARMS WERE TO SMALL, SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO THAT ONE.  THE  TOP FROM THE WASTE UP ARE VERY SMALL INCLUDING THE ARMS.  THE MATERIAL IS STRETCHY, BUT THE WAY THE WAIST LINE IS DONE, IT CAN'T STRETCH THERE, WHICH IS WHERE IT NEEDS IT THE MOST.  UNLESS YOU ARE A TINY PERSON, THESE AREN'T GOING TO WORK FOR YOU.  I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GET THE MEASUREMENTS TO PUT IN THEIR SIZE CHART, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO BY THE INCHES THEY PUT IN THERE AND YOUR MEASUREMENTS AND IT SHOULD FIT, BUT IT DOESN'T.  I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE IT AWAY TO MY FRIENDS 12 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER.  DON'T EVEN WANT TO DEAL WITH EXCHANGES.  LUCKILY IS WAS NOT THAT MUCH MONEY TO BE OUT, THAT'S WHY I TOOK A CHANCE.  OH WELL."
415,Becca Sanders,3.0,the United States ,"December 5, 2022",True to fit is not accurate,Unfortunately this dress does not fit and I will be sending it back. There is a piece of elastic that is supposed to run underneath the breasts that is hard to see on most of the pictures because the fabric is too dark. It basically split mine in half making it look like I had 4 instead of 2. The arms are also very tight around the upper arm area.
416,carolinagirl2020,3.0,the United States ,"December 7, 2022",Comfortable.  I ordered a size down and am glad I did.,Comfortable. LOTS of compliments as a wedding guest.  I ordered a size down and am glad I did.  NOTE - the blue is NOT royal blue.  It is navy/midnight.  I was disappointed in the color which is the reason for three stars.
417,Mary Beth Mathews,3.0,the United States ,"December 5, 2022",Not true to size,Fabric was nice. I followed the suggested sizing but it was way too small through the chest & waist.  I could not go larger as it was already below my ankles in length. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù
418,Sandra A. Kroll,3.0,the United States ,"November 29, 2022",I loved the fit of the dress.,The fit of the dress was perfect and flattering. I did not like the fabric. The fabric looked like crushed velvet not the smooth velvet pictured.

420,Shannon Kuleto,3.0,the United States ,"September 24, 2022",Overall fit skin-tight. Must return.,"I consistently wear a 1X dress, but bought 2X in this material so there'd be some ""forgiveness"" - but sad to say this dress fit me like Spanx! So tight I was afraid I wouldn't get it off! The label indeed says 2X but the fit for me was more like size L or perhaps a Juniors XL. My first ever Amazon return, and the process seems easy--just drop off unboxed at nearest Whole Foods, so there's that :-)). Very pretty dress in the dark green."
421,Emily Elizabeth,3.0,the United States ,"October 16, 2022",chest too small,this dress was as expected but the chest was really tight. it wasnt uncomfortable but it looked silly.
422,Stephanie Wukovitz,3.0,the United States ,"December 4, 2016",Waistband rode up over my bust when I raised my arms -- and stayed there.,"I'm 5'4"", 35-28-39, with shoulders wider than hips, long and slender arms, high bust, short waist, fairly narrow ribcage, a disproportionate amount of my weight carried in the hips and buttocks but not thighs.  In knits with this much spandex I usually take a women's small or medium (long sleeves, XS or S (short sleeves), XS (sleeveless).  An empire waist that's fitted through most of the torso looks great on my kind of figure.  Reading the reviews, I decided to get a medium, a size larger than average for me.But... after putting this dress on, I couldn't grab enough fabric on the upper part of the sleeve to rotate it into the right position.  Yup, it was that tight.  After much struggling I finally wrestled the sleeves into position and looked in the mirror -- great from every angle, with substantial fabric, and rich, flattering colors (green and wine red each look nice with pale olive skin and dark brown hair).  However, the waistband rode up over my bust when I raised my arms -- and stayed there.  Hilarious.So yeah, I'm exchanging it for an XL (same size I usually need when buying non-stretchy tops) but I'm concerned that the fit in the waist will be terrible and that my ability to insert back darts won't be up to the job of handling a thick knit fabric like this.  Fingers crossed.(Dress is awesome enough otherwise for me to give a much larger size a try.  I may up this rating to 4 stars if the XL manages to be flattering on me despite the huge-for-me waist measurement listed.)-----Update:  Inserting back darts (look up ""swayback alteration"") did help in making the dress conform nicely to my ribcage.  I got a lot of compliments at the holiday party I wore this to!However, my housemate, who pinned them for me and volunteered to do the sewing so I could get some sleep, took a bit of poetic license with fabric type and left me a note: ""Was up until 3am removing cat hair.  Never let this touch carpet.  Kitchen floor is swept and probably the safest place to put on/off.  Perhaps avoid the Satan [sic] Fabric in the future unless an automatic hair remover is included.""A little unfortunate since this company's scoopneck/princess seamed version of this dress in wine was already on its way to me, but a point well taken -- you might want to skip the velvet garments, at least THIS velvet, if you own two long-haired cats, if you haven't already figured such things out for yourself :)"
423,Nouvelle H√©lo√Øse,3.0,the United States ,"January 17, 2019","Shoulder area incorrect, arms hang backward","I used to sew professionally.  Here's my educated opinion:Pros:--Fabric is of a good weight.  I've worked with lusher stretch velvet, but perhaps a medium weight is better for this dress, as it might get too heavy with a more plush material.--Color is beautiful.  I wish I could find this green more often, and it's largely why I bought this dress.--Sewing quality is pretty good.--No weird smells.  It has a light ""new fabric"" smell, but I'd be comfortable wearing this right out of the box, and I have a sensitive nose.--Seems like the fabric and construction make this a dress that could be machine-washed easily.  (One of the great things about stretch velvet.)The big con:--The construction around the shoulder is off.  The back appears to be slightly longer than the front, draped section, and so even on a hanger, the shoulder seam rests just in front of the top of the hanger.  The front of the dress doesn't seem like it was build to contain much of a chest--and I'm only a 36C, so far from ""busty""--and so my breasts then pull the seam forward a bit more.  The sleeves were set as though the shoulder seam is the top, and so the sleeves actually hang backward slightly.  On the hanger, I didn't see this tilt, but put the dress on a moderately-shapely woman like me and it became obvious.  I see this flaw in some of the other customer photos as well.  The dress looks great flat on the table, but the human body is not flat as a table.Yeah, it's probably minor to 99% of the people looking at this dress, and it's not something I normally would notice, if I saw someone else wearing it.  It does, however, really irk me.  I could reset the sleeves, but as the entire dress appears to be built by serger, I think it'd be more trouble than it's worth.  I'll probably just return the dress."

I normally wear a 2/4 in pants and the small fits but is loose around the waist. I will probably end up taking a small tuck in the waist to feel more comfortable. Since they have an elastic waist, a small tuck is not noticeable.  I am just under 5‚Äô4‚Äù and the petite is just the right length for me with regular shoes (not heels)."

But it's the perfect length to wear with pretty flats. I'm not sure it would be long enough to wear with heels. If you're that size, 5'4"" or under and you're planning to wear heels with it, probably best to get the X-large regular. I'm familiar with the brand and so I knew it would fit me; the only question was the length, which, as noted, was ideal, too! Very, very pleased with this purchase."

One a size 3 XL and the other a 4 XL.  I am a 2 XL thinking that one of these would fit. I was wrong. the 4XL problably is a size 16.  This is crazy. So I put in for a product return. It said the buyer had to approve the return. Ok I got the approval back in 15 min. But I have to have a lable from the buyer as to where to send these dresses back.

I don't know about the other colors, but I bought this dress because the yellow looked cute and pastel, perfect for what I was looking for. But when it arrived, it was an overly vibrant, putrid yellow which clashed with pretty much everything around it. The fabric was slightly transparent too, so your undergarments could be seen through it if they didn't match your skin tone. Also, if you do end up buying this dress (hopefully in a different color), it runs a little large, so buy a size down."

The fit in the waist was good, and the length was fine.  But the top was way too snug.  I‚Äôm not large-chested (34B) and overall I‚Äôm pretty small framed, but it was too tight.  Yet I feel a medium would be too big on me.  I felt like it would have worked if it had been cut differently.  It has kind of a vintage/bridesmaid-y feel to it.

I am not sure if this is just a one-time situation, but I hope the next time, this supplier is inspecting garments before they are shipped.  I was not informed I would be buying a used product.  I don't have a problem with purchasing a returned item, as long as it has been laundered appropriately and the seller has noted this is a used item.Other than the stain, I am impressed with the quality of material.  It will need a good steam before I wear it and I plan to try my best to remove the deodorant with the old pantyhose trick."

492,Amazon Customer,5.0,the United States ,"November 4, 2022",Classy & Elegant,"This dress is perfect!  Even though I read a ton of reviews so I could figure out what size would work best, this dress still surprised me in a good way.  I usually run between sizes (S, M) and I went with a medium in the velvet green dress.  I am 5'8"", 134 lbs, with a slightly muscular/lean build.  This dress lays really well on the body.  With the added belt it looks even better.  I'm sure it could be dressed up even more with a fancier belt if needed.  The cap sleeves are flattering (even if you have broad shoulders, like I do), fit comfortably, and cover normal bra straps.  No special bra needed, but it still flatters ladies with smaller chests!  The inner top was lined, but the skirt was not.  I will probably wear it with a slip.  I will be wearing this dress tonight and I will try to update my review with a photo.  I am so happy with this purchase, especially at the $40ish price tag.Edited on 11/29/22 with attached image:I have already worn this dress twice and I still LOVE it!  I have received so many compliments.  It is comfortable and classy and I've worn it to a family member's high school event as well as to an adult cocktail party.

I like the belt, but I was pleased to see that it's removable and there aren't any loops on the dress for it, adding to the versatility. I plan on taking it on a cruise and using it for the 3 formal nights. I bought the black and plan on just changing out accessories, belt on, belt off, etc. I also like the fit and flare style for ease of wear. I plan on fully enjoying ALL THE FOOD AND DRINK on the cruise and I can see this dress won't punish me for putting on a bit of tummy pudge by the 3 formal night! At this price, it's a no-brainer."

This is just a classy, elegant, comfortable dress for any occasion.  Extremely flattering style with just the perfect amount of stretch.  I own it in small and medium, both sizes fit very well.

506,Jason Pattee,4.0,the United States ,"November 17, 2020",Very similar to the cozy cabin dress.,"Very similar to the cozy cabin dress. So I am a petite belt woman, so the upper part of the dress from the shoulders to the chest are a little oversized for me even with a medium. However the rest of the dress fits pretty well. There is a slight gap with the buttons near my chest so I may need to add another button in between and or just wear it open with a tank underneath. I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and wear a 34D. But if I had bought a large it would look stupid big.  It is not the best quality dress I‚Äôve purchased, so I would probably compare this to Old Navy quality. When I first put the dress on the sides of the dress near my hips want to stick out way further than where my hips are, but once you add the tie belt it readjust it makes it look less severe. I would not size up on this dress unless you have unusually large arms or large chest. I would say this dress fits true to size. I will definitely be line drying this dress."
507,Audrey,4.0,the United States ,"December 28, 2021",Super cute. Wish it had some stretch in the shoulders,"I am 5‚Äô6, 130-135, 34 D.I ordered a medium based on reviews but ended up swapping for a small. Still fit a little loose in the waist but you can tie it tighter, so that‚Äôs not a huge deal. I just wish the dress had some stretch to the shoulder area. Even with it being loose everywhere else, the shoulders still felt kinda tight when trying to drive, or do anything else with your arms lol.Overall I‚Äôm happy with it and will be keeping the small."
508,rachel christiansen,4.0,the United States ,"December 20, 2021",Not bad,"I love this dress, the 2 issues I have with it arw the buttons are too far apart so if you have big boobs the gap will open and you'll be showing some boob. And since it's a dress you cant really wear anything under it on top. The other thing is the belt is a tad too small. The bow it makes it's pretty small. Other wise its pretty good, I've had it well over a year and it's great for the holidays"

A lots of people were complaining with tide sleeves. XL size is giving me enough room for my arms. I am 5'10 tall dress is reaching up my tights enough to cover my bootie but I am having plan to wear under it- a short shorts. I am 127 pounds slim build with smaller chest not as is lady on the picture. My fit is good in this area where I can button up all the way  or just leave it open as is on the picture. I have no big complains for this item. For this price looks good made. Its cute little sporty dress for usual day. I contacted company with the question of the length of the dress in size XL but I didn't receive any answer.

Very much a straight fitting dress and a but darker than the picture (much more periwinkle not baby blue).I will say if straight dresses are good for you, this dress is incredibly comfortable. The sleeves don't have the bunching at the wrists like most sweatshirts and I was quite tempted to keep it just to sleep in because of how soft it was.Thick material and we'll made but I just couldn't get past the cut."

I‚Äôm going to wash & dry on high heat, so hopefully it‚Äôs a bit more form fitting, whilst keeping some of its forgiveness. ALSO, this item is truly a dress, not a long sweatshirt. I wish it were a bit shorter, but hoping after shrinking a bit I‚Äôll like the fit even more. Last, bc it‚Äôs super warm fleece, I think a half slip or slick leggings would make it the most flattering bc the material wouldn‚Äôt stick anywhere. Overall very well made!

I get so many compliments.  When I first put them on I thought the shoulders had awkward points sticking up.  No worries they are simply folding creases and come out in the wash.  If it is chilly  I wear thin leggings with them.  They are also a great value!  I have Heather Gray and Coral Stripe.  I hesitated to get the white stripe as afraid the white would be see through.

I was reluctant to order based upon the reviews, but the price was very reasonable, so I ordered it.  It fits me perfectly!  It fits me on the top and then drops down.  It is sweatshirt like material.  At 5 ft 6 in tall, the dress comes to me right above the knee.  At this moment I am wearing it with jeans underneath.

557,arieldelrey,4.0,the United States ,"November 17, 2022",Cute but not durable,"Wore this dress to a wedding. Great color and liked the material, although the front didn‚Äôt sit as low on the bust as I would have liked. unfortunately, after wearing this for just under two hours, the elastic at the waist popped and so the dress hung very loosely with no form on me for the rest of the evening. Big bummer. I don‚Äôt care enough to repair it, but if it had stayed in tact I probably would have worn it again, as I got a lot of compliments."
558,Corrin Mansfield,4.0,the United States ,"December 2, 2022",Make sure to have fashion tape,The dress looked great but the waistband is very tight and the top wouldn‚Äôt adjust enough to prevent slipping without using fashion tape.The tie for the top also didn‚Äôt want to stay tied so I ended up knotting it and then doing the bow and that worked well.Overall I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a decent dress as long as you know what to expect.
559,Bree,4.0,the United States ,"November 13, 2022",Cute and perfect for wedding guest,"I‚Äôm wore 2.5 inch boots and still personally found it a bit longer than I hoped but I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô1 so that‚Äôs not surprising. The top tie is slightly awkward for bigger chests, but I looped one side around my bra and then put the other through to create a knotted look and tied in the back. This felt like better coverage for me and I personally found it cuter."
560,Sarah Bayne,4.0,the United States ,"October 27, 2022",Material is pretty,"I really love this dress and it was flattering but I went according to my  bust measurements for my chest and it gapped. I bought the red and the wine color and they are both gorgeousRed is on left and wine is on right for color referenceNeither were too orange but if looking for a blue red, I‚Äôd personally pick wine"
561,Desire,4.0,the United States ,"November 11, 2022",cute but don‚Äôt size up,this was a really cute dress but i‚Äôm going to have to return it because I ordered a size up which wasn‚Äôt needed at all the dress has a lot of give so stick with your normal size
562,ATOZ,4.0,the United States ,"October 31, 2022",Cute dress but not for me,"The dress itself is cute but i am small chested, this dress is not for people with small chests. I would have to tape and pin the cleavage area and that still is too loose for me."
563,Clare,4.0,the United States ,"August 17, 2022",Watch out big chested ladies!!,"I wore this dress to a wedding! This is how I styled the peacock blue swatch. I initially bought a medium, that‚Äôs my usual size‚Ä¶I have large breasts (36D) and the medium did not have nearly enough fabric to keep the wedding to at least PG 13. I sized up to large and was still experiencing difficulty with the tied part keep the girls in check‚Ä¶my boyfriend frequently had to tell me throughout the night to re-tie the dress because he could see my bra spilling out. However, if I went any larger, I would be swimming in the dress in other areas just to accommodate my breasts. I also have a short torso, so I found it difficult to style the dress similar to the pictures provided. Overall, I really liked it‚Ä¶just beware if you have a bigger chest."
564,Juana,4.0,the United States ,"August 10, 2022",Perfect for someone tall!,"I'm 5'5' and 150lbs, 36A, and this cute dress falls to my shins. The back elastic band sits a bit too low for my body proportion because if I were to pull it up to where I'd like, the fabric bunches up strangely. The fabric was beautiful and light and arrived in good condition. The zipper is stiff on the way down, but that would only be a problem if I were in a rush. The pink tone looked nice on my medium olive complexion. I'm wearing this for my mom's birthday party, so I wrapped the dress around my waist to cover the keyhole and tied it at the front for modesty. It also looks lovely with the keyhole and a front bow for those comfortable with more skin showing.  I can see this suiting someone over 5""5' and/or someone with a longer torso."
565,Amazon Customer,4.0,the United States ,"October 29, 2022",The tie is not as pictured,"The dress is overall super cute, decent quality. The tie in the front has a horizontal seam, meaning I could only tie it in the front to hide it."
566,Jenn,4.0,the United States ,"October 11, 2022",Beautiful dress - but need diff color,I loved the material and style of the dress.

567,TM82,2.0,the United States ,"April 28, 2022","Cheap looking, arrived damaged","I ordered this for a funeral and it even felt matronly for an event such as that. It's very unflattering and the material looks super cheap, so overall it just is not a good look. The dress I received also arrived with a big snag all the way down one arm - so I would have returned it either way."

I am quite disappointed  though, because I saw that the colour, it was not as I saw it on the screen. I have bought many dresses at Amazon in the last 2 years, and this is the first one where the colour is different. On screen the colour I see is a seafoam, more on the green side. In reality, it is more like a teal or aqua and on the blue side..  It sucks because the colour was why I chose it, too, but I'll keep it.  Perhaps this was just my problem, but I caution people that the other colours may be different too...  Thank you!"
575,The Reen,4.0,the United States ,"October 30, 2022",Cute for multi-season dressing,Purchased my usual medium. Could have sized down but it works. Dress is super cute and a nice option for spring and fall. I belted it to give it a little shapr.The only thing I can't stand is the tie at the neck. It cheapens the whole dress. I will just deal with it for the price but it certainly gives it that amazon look and not elevated

I have to send this color back but I have to order a new one in purple again because the wedding I am going to is next week and I can‚Äôt wait for the return. Overall though good dress.

It was a little too long (I am 5'2"" though so keep that in mind) and so it felt very Little House on the Prairie. But the bust had ZERO give. Unless you are the captain of the itty-bitty-titty committee, I would suggest to steer clear of this dress. I looked like I had two balloons strapped to my chest since it was spilling out on the top and the bottom, but flat In the middle... not a good look."

The dress is long and made of a comfy fabric which is great but oversized and not flattering. The print was too bold, not subtle as in the image.

I am 65 years old, 4'11"" & weigh 118 lbs.  The lace on bottom hem complimented my legs & the fabric had a lot of stretch. The only negative I would say was the seam at the waist, it's kind of noticeable.  So I had a shiny black belt from another dress, tried it, looked great so that's how I wore it.  The little lace flutter sleeves were really nice & readily hid my less than flattering upper arms.  All in all, for the price, I really love the dress."

634,Heather,3.0,the United States ,"January 14, 2022","Runs a little big, boxy and unflattering","I've been looking for a new long sleeve dress that is an appropriate length for me as a teacher.  I've read lots of great things about this particular one, so I decided to give it a try.  I ordered it the grey green color, which doesn't quite match the pictures, it was much lighter in person.  I think if I had picked a different color (black, why didn't I order you) I wouldn't have hated the dress as much as I did.I am 5'7 and 125lbs for reference.The neck is like a boat crew, very wide so you might need to wear a strapless bra if you don't want to be constantly adjusting, not a huge deal for me.I ordered in a size small, and the dress was very unflattering on me.  I am on the thinner side so it wasn't quite 'body con' as described, which was disappointing.  The overall length of the dress was perfect, not too short, not too long.  The sleeves were a tiny bit short on me (this is something I am used to, but still frustrating).  I like the tie waist to give the dress a little bit of shape, but overall the size was too big for me.  Disappointed that a smaller size is not offered. Quality seemed good and this particular color was not sheer as some people have described other colors to be.Ultimately returned the dress as it was just not the right shape/size for me!"

I'm not taking a cheap dress to the dry cleaners every time. It goes through the wash just fine.On the plus side, I love the neckline, pockets, and versatile belt that can be tied in the front or the back. I bought a size small for reference.

While quite form fitting, it was very flattering and skimmed gently over the evidence that I am a mom of four. Great length, not-too-high side slit, nice coverage on top, decent length sleeves. The emerald color was beautiful. I was so pleased. Unfortunately, on the day of my event, I discovered a hole in the fabric on the back of the dress. I was so to send it back. Maybe I‚Äôll buy another, but I worry about the quality of the fabric. I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù and between 145-150. I got this dress in size Med."
650,Master Shopper,3.0,the United States ,"November 17, 2022","Not a ""sweater""; runs large/long","This dress is a thin, silky knit rather than a heavier ""sweater"" dress.  It's a nice fabric, and I would have tried a smaller size if it was available.  Ordered the small and it was too long overall and too long in the torso.  Hiking it up around the waist made the bottom half fit better, but there was too much loose fabric up top.  For reference, I'm 5' 5"" and a pear-ish 137 lbs."
651,HannahJo,3.0,the United States ,"November 12, 2022",Beautiful Color,Wedding Guest Dress! This is a beautiful color. I‚Äôm very comfortable with my size and shape but did notice it hugged my stomach more than I‚Äôd prefer. The breast button is noticeable if you want to wear it unopened so I choose not to but I wish I could‚Äôve. No surprise with length! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and predicted it would fall about here on me. A good choice for me but be sure you‚Äôll be happy with how it hugs your body.

I got a small.  BUT the material is much to be desired. Its a cheap naterial, something similar you would get at a fast fashion store. The ribbing is not thick. I think this is a dupe for another dress at a more high end store of which I'll look for in the near future. For what I needed it for it will do but it will not be a dress i will probably wear again. If you want a classy chic look paying attention to the material is key. I didnt do that when I purchased this dress. As daid it does the job for for today"

I cinched it up and threw a Jean jacket on and it looked good I thought. I also let the strings out like a pencil dress and layered it with a nice top and a belt on the waist and it passed for boss babe work wear. Have had many compliments so far. Added a jacket for more edgy-ness. All in all I really like this dress in all the different ways you can wear it and style it.

It‚Äôs cute and I guess in the picture it looks more like a tight fitted dress with rouching on the sides, when in reality it‚Äôs more like the entire side of the dress is drawstring so you can draw up and gather the whole side of the dress. Which is cool and gives you a couple of different ways where it. I like it! Again I think I got it a little bit too big but it‚Äôs definitely cute and I like the way it was styled in the picture so I‚Äôm definitely going to try to do that look too don‚Äôt tell anybody lol"

This feels like a high end dress, well made, and has good stretch, material is thick and no see through areas.  The fit is good, definitely shows cleavage, and the skirt isn't as tapered as I would want.  I'm short, 4'9"" so it's a bit longer than I'd like comes about 2-3 inches below the knee.  Haven't decided if I'm keeping it because I ordered another dress that I liked slightly better for the occasion.  I would have to have this hemmed to my ideal length and also have the skirt tapered to a pencil skirt cut because it is a bit too loose in the way it is cut.  For reference, I ordered small, I am 4'9"" just had baby few months ago at 122lbs right now, have 8 lbs to lose, 29 waist (still have inches to lose), 38 hip, 32DDD.  Also, the way this dress gathers at the dress does help with a bit of tummy, but the tie at the waist adds unnecessary volume in that midsection and would prefer it without."

I guess if you run cold you might consider this a good thing but I'm just so confused why they chose to make the dress out of this material. It's too bad, because the style is great but everything else...woof.If you do still decide to try it, I'd recommend going up a size."

729,Sonia Day,4.0,the United States ,"September 4, 2022",Silky Soft Neutral Green Dress- Bad For Sweat,"This is the softest silkiest dress I own now, and the material is a little stretchy, but it is a little shorter in the back than expected for my semi thicker thighs. I had to pull the dress down a lot to keep it from riding up in the lower back area, and the shape of the dress is flattering if you can keep it in place better than I did. I do like the matching buttons, and they are all held in place by elastic bands, but if you push up your sleeves out of habit like I do, then there might be a decent sized gap above the cuff, and it also felt a little out of the norm since the elastic around the button gets stretched. The back isn't particularly my favorite due to the elastic waist band showing along with the bunching of material right below the elastic. Also, if you sweat just from thinking about sweat like me, then I recommend a different dress since this material showed sweat under my arms not even 30 mins after wearing. I couldn't give this dress 3 stars because I think it would fit other body shapes and those who don't sweat or aren‚Äôt bothered by it much better. Thanks and hope this helps!"

733,Jimena,4.0,the United States ,"July 25, 2022",Good quality and price,"I think the quality of the material is really nice, soft and has a little stretch. For $30 this feels more expensive.

Paid $50 for the slip to only reach my knees and the bottom part of the dress is completely see through. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5, the dress is 3 inches short in the back and the front is so long I keep tripping over it. Not comfortable fabric. Looks nothing like the pictures. I ordered in 3 colors and 2 sizes, L and XL. The L was too small and the XL was too big. The seams in the front of the dress are an unflattering upward V shape and makes your hips look 10 times larger. This dress is SO cheap and overpriced. I had to sew my own slip and bring in the waist on the XL. For having to basically remake the dress I really want my money back. I didn‚Äôt have time to shop for more dresses for a wedding coming up or I would have sent all 3 back instead of just the 2. This dress is my biggest regret of the year‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm a broke college student. I wish I could give 0 stars 100 times over.

814,Ashley Fitzpatrick,3.0,the United States ,"October 5, 2022",Size down,I bought this dress thinking it would be a great wedding guest dress. I am traditionally a medium and that‚Äôs what I ordered. It was very large on me and at waist the elastic did not hold against my body which made it look sloppy. I think sizing down may have helped but also I would worry about how short it was when sizing down. I think this would fit a shorter person better for length and overall size down for a better fit around the waist. I did love the color of the dress and wish it fit better!
815,JC1112,3.0,the United States ,"October 5, 2022",Unflattering Waistline,"The look of this fabric is absolutely beautiful with the gold accents. It looks more high-end than what it cost. I wanted to love it. Unfortunately, the waist line was just slightly too high and hit me at a point that was very unflattering. It made me look much wider than I am, instead of hitting at my natural waist and slimming. This style normally is flattering on me, just this particular dress wasn‚Äôt right."

It looks good on smaller/skinner people but not me- if I go up a size then the sleeves are too long/big and the waist is loose and it just doesn't end up right. The sleeves are thin and breathable which makes them good for summer, but other than that this is not my favorite dress."
822,LegoGirl,3.0,the United States ,"August 1, 2022",Inner lining is sewn oddly,"This dress is pretty on the outside, but the opaque inner lining fabric is sewn in oddly. Usually dresses like this have a loose camisole slip inside for the lining, but this one is actually sewn to the outer layer as well. And the way it's sewn, it's much more fitted than the outer fabric. Not a fan."
833,Claire,2.0,the United States ,"October 24, 2022",Not a Fan.,Very disappointed. I ordered this dress because someone on Instagram said it was fleeced lined and it also said it was fleece lined in the reviews. Clearly this design has been changed. It is a very cheap material and I did not feel confident in it at the wedding. You can see in the picture I attached that the dress was too big. I will not be buying from this company again.

The material was heavier than I expected which is fine with me since I ordered it for an outdoor fall wedding.  Overall, it's a really cute dress for the price.  My only other critical comment is the zipper isn't the best and i had some problems zipping it up and down.  Hopefully it doesn't break on me!  I will submit another review with photos once I receive the small."

865,Jonathan Chamberlin,1.0,the United States ,"May 8, 2022",SO CHEAP,"On initial wear, this dress was so flattering. However, it is VERY CHEAPLY MADE. The zipper is made out of plastic and has no hook at the top to keep the garment together. As a result, the dress is liable to separate with very little force.I wore this dress to a cocktail party and the zipper tore apart when I went to the bathroom.  I was essentially naked at the party and luckily my husband and I were able to find a stapler and literally had to staple the dress back together. It was absolutely mortifying.Unless you plan to do no bending or moving or dancing, I would -13355/10 recommend this dress. Can‚Äôt even return it because I literally had to staple it together."

No tag anywhere on the dress. It had been worn and returned and resold! I refunded it and ordered another one. This one arrives with the tag BUT had dog hair all over it! The tag on this dress can easily be tucked in and hidden which means people can wear it and easily return it and guess what..YOU may end up with it! I now have no dress to wear after purchasing 2 dresses! We are still in a pandemic people!!! Stop being nasty. Don‚Äôt wear things and ship them back to end up in other homes!

Fabric was more like a midgrade bed sheet than a satin.  VERY thin material.  Zippered side did not have a clasp to hold the top together so when zipping I had to be careful not to pinch my skin.  My ribcage measures 33"" and the medium just barely fit.  Dress didnt have the ""beltloop strings"" to hold the belt up (my hips did fine, but if you dont have much there it might fall)Personally, I returned this item.  It just wasn't for me and for the amount of money that was I could definitely get a higher quality item elsewhere.  If you're not balling on a budget, I would suggest a different dress."
876,Nich≈ële Tucker,2.0,the United States ,"August 31, 2022",Unflattering,The dress fit me but it was weirdly loose in random places. Tight on my shoulder and breast but the space in-between was like I could stick my whole hand through. I'm not sure if it's because I'm very busty or the material is too stretchy. It made me look really weird because of this so I returned it.

The color is beautiful, and was exactly what I was looking for in that aspect, but the fit was disastrous. It was far from flattering and I am a pretty average size and build (5'8"", ~150lbs, size 6/8). The cowl neck top would not lay right across my d√©colletage, and the dress itself just looked frumpy and fit poorly. Also was very very very wrinkled. I am not sure if those wrinkles would have come out even with an iron, definitely not with a steamer alone. Ugh! This dress was such a disappointment!"

It‚Äôs a prime free return item but once you select to return the item the seller says ‚ÄúReturn Mailing Label:The Seller will provide a Return Mailing Label within 5 days of your return request date.‚Äù But never provides the label.

No wrong. The material was so soft and loved the color but when I tried it on it looked like a rag on me. Gave me no shape at all and the neck part looked like it was just stretched out and didn't look flattering at all. The straps were so thin that I thought they would break. I am sure someone out there can make this dress look great but not me."
893,Natalie Torretti,1.0,the United States ,"October 9, 2022",It arrived with a giant stain-EW,"I opened it and tried it on and immediately noticed a giant, gross stain at the bottom of the front of the dress. Disgusting. The fit was also too big, too much fabric in the midsection. The fabric has good stretch so I would size down and pray it comes in good condition with no suspicious stains. I returned it and got a refund. Waste of time and partly traumatized."
894,Saucie,1.0,the United States ,"August 23, 2021",Wildly inconsistent quality,"I first ordered a blue dress, and it was absolutely amazing, thick fabric, real dress, very classy, curves sewn in to make it dress shaped, exactly as pictured. Loved it. Wanted every color. They got me.So I ordered a green one that looked the same but didn't have the slit. This one was not even a dress, just a thin sheer wrinkled fabric with no shape, like a tube of cloth with straps at the end. Luckily Amazon is great about returns.Then tried to order a red version of the blue dress I loved so much, made sure the label was the same, the photo was the same and should've been the same dress, just red. I received a near neon pink dress that was also completely different, this one with fabric quality somewhere between the first two, but the cut was so narrow at the chest that my boobs can fall out the sides and the bottom hem was not even finished, with a bundle of red thread hanging off the side seam."

It‚Äôs paper thin, very clingy and static-y, and the cowl neck is awful looking. It also has a strip of fabric inside along the bust that goes straight across about 2‚Äù under my nipples and because the fabric is so thin, is SUPER obvious. My underwear band is super noticeable too.  I bought the black so ‚Äúlumps‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt be so obvious, but in this dress, EVERYTHING is obvious. I‚Äôm so bummed! All those people who said it was thick material got a different dress than I did! It only looks nice if you bend over, stick your butt out and pose, but I can‚Äôt walk around doing that!:) I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù, 145 and I ordered a medium with no slit."

When I had it on correctly it felt like it was off the the side like pulling a certain way like the seam might be off centered? I‚Äôm not sure, but it looks good, despite that feeling lol(Bust- 34, waist-24, hips- 35)"
901,Lynn,4.0,the United States ,"December 1, 2022",Real Life Barbie,"Fun wedding dress!! Fabric is a bit heavy, but nice for a fall wedding. Don't lean forward! I flashed a few people... The slit sits right at the side and almost towards the back, which is odd. Plus, it was a bit tight in my hips and I had to keep twisting it around. Otherwise, I received a lot of compliments, mostly involving the word ""stunning"" so it was a win for me. The fabric ""pulls"" very easily though, and I think the dress is no longer wearable."
902,Sam ,4.0,the United States ,"October 23, 2022",Good dress but if you‚Äôre super skinny - don‚Äôt get this dress!,I was skeptical when ordering this dress just because I am very petite and was worried it wouldn‚Äôt flatter me. Sadly I was correct. The fabric is good quality and the color is true to the picture (It looks like a diff color in my pic only bc of the lighting in my room). I am very skinny and this dress accentuated that. If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going for then great - this dress will be a good option. However there was a bubble of fabric on my left hip of just empty space bc I don‚Äôt have hips to fill it out! Will be returning but the actual dress is decent.

I can‚Äôt tell if it looks cheap or not? It is longer than expected. One important thing is if you have a larger chest it will show from the side. It is clingy so this is not your dress if you‚Äôre scared of showing some love rolls. 50/50 chance I‚Äôll wear this for the wedding.

It fit great, and it's the perfect length for classy but not too formal events. Be aware the top does kind of swoop or fold so depending on your bra size you may need to adjust it a little. Honestly would wear again and I'll probably get another in a different color!"
907,Teri,4.0,the United States ,"November 6, 2022",Very flattering,The only reason I gave the dress 4 instead of 5 stars was because there were little nicks of fabric on the dress but where it scrunchies up you can‚Äôt tell I love the color I love the fit I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 130 -127 lbs and purchased a small
908,Michelle,4.0,the United States ,"October 29, 2022",Flattering satin dress!,This dress is so good. You do not need a bar and it still looks very flattering and lifted. It‚Äôs definitely the neckline. The slit was higher and was sewed off centered so it doesn‚Äôt sit right and spins a little. Slightly annoying but still looks good. The length is below the knee so it‚Äôs attractive and still sexy. Great purchase
909,Emily Phillippe,4.0,the United States ,"October 22, 2022",Fit,The shoulders were quite broad. Considering it has a satin material it does have some stretch to it. Not much. But a little stretch. Great color. i do think if you had a slightly bigger chest you could fit this dress better. I am only a B cup and the neck line didn‚Äôt know how to lay. But if you were to fill out the dress more the fit would be more appealing.

The top half of the dress is very loose. The elastic around the bust isn't snug enough to wear without a bra and will require clothing tape to keep it close to the skin. The color is gorgeous and the material is soft. The dress does have a flow but the bust is loose and the elastic on the waist band is not flattering to wear without the included ribbon or a belt. With a little TLC I will be able to make this dress look as desired for an upcoming wedding. The best part of the dress is the bottom layer and how it flows. The dress is worth the try, overall it is a beautiful dress."

I just could not post a picture of myself in this outfit. Somehow it was too big and too small for me?  The lines of the cut just fit me poorly but maybe it‚Äôs because I have a longer torso?The material is a slinky, satiny feel and was very comfortable but I would not hate a liner. It repelled the wine glass I spilled on it oddly well too. Whoops lol.Not my favorite but I could see if you had a shorter torso this being a great dress for a classy event like a wedding or the theater."

I first ordered in a lighter color which was lined, with the dress itself a comfortable fabric and the sizing a little large. I went to reorder in a different color and size down, and received a dress with a different brand label ""Fashion"" rather than ""Pretty Garden"" (which the company says is the same), made of a very synthetic feeling fabric, and sized differently than the first.

The neckline was completely unflattering and did not sit nicely (I have broad shoulders too). I even tried putting a nice lace camisole under it, but it somehow made it look worse.

This dress unfortunately, is super baggy right in front of my stomach. If you have ever seen those shows where someone is 600 pounds and loses a huge amount of weight and they end up with a lot of excess skin on their stomach that forms skin flaps, then that is exactly how this dress looked on me. It was such a disappointment to try on because I loved the way it looked online.I asked a tailor if they could fix it, and they told me the cost of tailoring the dress far outweighed the quality and cost of the dress itself. Also, the neck like is kind of odd."

NOOOO! The cut is so wrong. It is not as represented at all.The picture makes it look like an adorable sundress. BUT the model‚Äôs hair hides the sleeves. The neckline appears to be sleeveless with a slightly scoop neck. Not so. The neckline is very straight and square with the sleeves chopped off right at the end of your shoulder - the look is like a 70s muscle shirt. Or a 90s top you throw plaid flannel over to go to a grunge concert.The neckline / weird sleeves are ugly enough‚Ä¶ but also they make the dress hang in a weird way. Just ugh.2 stars b/c I LOVE the color and the thigh slits. It‚Äôs almost perfect! Except for the unfashionable boyish sleeves.
993,Lindsey,2.0,the United States ,"October 13, 2022",Awkward,The color scheme I chose is not flattering.  I feel more like a Jack o Lantern than a vacation babe.  Has an awkward fit for me almost like an A shape smaller at neck and then slanted out progressively more extreMe as length increases.  Brought on a trip and didn‚Äôt wear; could work for a pool environment.  Would consider ordering a different color because I do like that I would be able to throw it on and roll out the door and it doesn‚Äôt need a special bra since the straps are covered.

In the photo for Tie Dye Tea Green, it's a lovely, light color, but not so in the one I received. It's quite muddled with black on the top but has a distinct lighter band below. Not what I expected. I'm 5'8"", 135 lbs, and ordered a small, but the armholes feel a little snug, but probably ok as I think a medium might be too baggy overall on me (It is quite big and unfitted in the hips). I'm going to return this one and try another and see if the color more resembles the one shown on the model. This isn't it."
999,Briana,2.0,the United States ,"August 31, 2022","Very poor quality, especially given the price","Quality is comparable to Shein and their competitors. Never in my WILDEST dreams could I imagine someone justifying $30+ on this garment. I purchased for a vacation but was astounded at how thin but rough the material was and how unflattering it was on my average body. I bought a M and L (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 150lbs) and neither fit or was comfortable. Would not recommend this product, just go to TJ Maxx or Marshall‚Äôs if you want something with decent quality under $30."
1000,JayDubya,2.0,the United States ,"April 21, 2022",Looks like a tent,"After reading MANY reviews, I felt like I had a good chance with this one. Purchased for an upcoming trip to a tropical destination. I am 5'6"" and about 145 pounds, and ordered a size large because I didn't want it to feel too clingy. Well, it didn't feel clingy, but the fit is akin to a tent. Not at all flattering (I'd actually assign this zero stars), and the fabric is thin enough where you can definitely see underwear lines. I ordered the orange/purple ""ombre"" color, and it's not a soft, pretty muted orange as the photo suggests. Instead, it's really like a NEON orange... think traffic cone. Not good! Returning it and super bummed. Fabric is indeed very soft, though. This is maybe more suitable for someone thinner that doesn't have any squishies like I do as a middle-aged woman."
1001,Belinda A.,2.0,the United States ,"September 6, 2022",Works best for kittens,This tower is well made and attractive in my home but only suitable for kittens.

1002,Cat,1.0,the United States ,"November 26, 2019",Beautiful dress if they send the correct size.,"Really cute sweater / tunic dress . I bought the blossom shade a very beautiful muted apricot tone.. I‚Äôm  5‚Äô3 108 lbs with a 34 b chest , 26 inch waist and 37.5 hips. The small size in the 2-8 is very fitted in the waist and pretty short on my petite frame. Whenstanding it is a nice length but once you move it really hikes up to my upper thigh and is very short in the back . I wear it with leggings for a less revealing look.Update I also received the berry and dark grey. These are huge obviously a mistake on the label when I compared the blossom which is very fitted to these two colors I have about 3 inches of material all through the chest to hem along with huge batwing arms. Obviously these dresses are not being consistently made to the correct size . I now understand the other reviews about the extra material at the under arm area and the extra 4-5 inches in length . Both the grey and berry were ordered in the same shorter version in a size 2-8. The grey was reordered and again it came in the longer version and was really big.Update I went back and reordered the blossom color and received one that was again 3 inches in extra material in the longer version the new one is labeled a size 2-8 but fits two sizes bigger . It is a shame because I would have ordered at least 4 more colors if I knew it would fit like the first blossom dress along with the plum one that my husband ordered for me. I have ordered a total of 6 dresses and only two came in the correct size.I have included photos of the two dresses in the shade blossom both were ordered in the shorter version in a size 2-8 along with the plum that was in the correct size to show the extra material on the other blossom dress that is 2 sizes too big. It was not  as long as the oversized grey dress or berry but still about 2 inches longer .If you are 5‚Äô1-5‚Äô4 , 100-114 lbs the size 2-8 in the short length should fall above your knee and have a very fitted look without 3 inches of extra material in the chest down to the hem length  if not they are sending you the longer version and an inaccurate size . Both the dresses that did fit had a tag sewn in at the back neck area . The other big dresses did not ,only a paper tag .My husband is now ordering the forest green. I hope that one is the correct size if not I will never try to  order this dress again . It is too time consuming to wait only to have to return. I just wanted to let people know how the size 2-8  shorter length should fit .I waited a few months and reordered the grey  it was huge . I will not be ordering anymore ."

I know because I ordered two different colors and the cream dress arrived with the tags and the necklace included. I'm really disappointed because I wanted to wear this dress 2 days from now and I can't and if I order another one it won't arrive on time. I am extremely disappointed.

I'm so mad, I can't send it back because I have nothing else that even fits! Nor will I receive anything else in time! I don't have extra time/money to go run out to the store and spend more money because of this situation, hence the reason I ordered online. I wanted to feel pretty and confident! Now I'm going to have to just rely on something else, or what say some grease ball touched my belly how embarrassing! This is a huge inconvenience and I'm extremely disappointed! I love the dress! Love how perfect it fits and I couldnt wait to wear it. I loved that it came in perfect time just unfortunately that mark is why I'm giving this a 1 star. Sorry, it's just unacceptable :/"

All other purchases we've made on Amazon from numerous vendors have been spot on in color.  This is the second dress from this vendor that my wife has purchased and both were about 10+ shades darker than they appear onscreen.  The first one was so far off she returned it,(Dark Navy Blue as opposed to the displayed Medium Gray Blue) the second dress she made a guess at the appearance of a different color and how dark it might be and she was correct with her guess based on the prior purchase and is pleased with that color.Quality make and fit are wonderful, simply be aware of the extreme color difference when purchasing."
1028,influence peddler,3.0,the United States ,"October 6, 2019",it suffers from lack of additional sizes.,"I bought my girlfriend an entire wardrobe last week, part of a stream of gifts leading up to our engagement, I reas really excited about this one.  I loved the purple color and how it appeared to fit the various models and user review photos.  I ordered the smallest size they sell (which covers a range of sizes and is its flaw).  The fact that they make each size to cover a range of sizes means that if you are on the smaller end of the size spectrum, its too big on you.  My girlfriend is petite and it looked..not good on her.  It was noticeably loose and did not have a good contouring effect like the photos.  If you are petite, this dress isnt going to work for you.  I bought her like 15 or 16 items, this is the only one we are sending back."
1029,Kim M.,3.0,the United States ,"November 20, 2019",Nice but runs very small.,"I ordered this in a hot pink color.  The sweater itself looked as well made as pricier sweaters and was pretty soft.  I had planned to wear it as more of a tunic over leggings than a dress; it came close to my knee and I am 5'5"".  Unfortunately, it is made small.  I didn't notice a problem with the armholes, as one reviewer had mentioned, the yarn was nice an stretchy and it wasn't uncomfortable at all, it was just skin tight, which is not a good look for me.  I am usually a size 16 but ordered what was supposed to be size 18-20 but it just won't work and that seems to be the largest size available.  Fit me more like a size 12-14.  If you're smaller though, I think it is a great sweater, especially in the pink color."

1031,sfastmix,3.0,the United States ,"November 5, 2015",Disappointed,"This was really a large disappointment for me. I received it in a great time, and it was just the thing I was looking for. However, I ordered a size down from my normal size and it's still very big on me - to the point that I'm not comfortable wearing it. It seems like it's good quality, but I won't ever be able to wear it.The day I received it, I tried it on and put it right back in its package to exchange it later only to have the package be misplaced while my roommate decided to do housework when I wasn't around. After a while looking for it, we concluded he must have thrown it away on accident and thought it was gone for good. I found it just yesterday to no avail. It is past time so I'm no longer able to return it.I take responsibility that I wasn't able to do the return/exchange, and it seems of good quality - this is why I give it 3 stars.But it does not fit to size - even one size down is uncomfortably large."
1032,Ashley,4.0,the United States ,"December 5, 2022",Felt cute,Very cute dress that served its purpose for our family Christmas pictures. The length of the dress was shorter than I anticipated so I had to keep pulling it down. I do have a belly so it was a little snug but nothing crazy since I got the xxl. If I‚Äôd have gotten the xl then it would have been too tight. But overall this was a great purchase and I felt cute in it. I want to get in red next.

It's just between blue and purple // so muchso myself and many others decided / that's purple - not blue... it looks different indifferent lighting - but looks NOTHING like this bright navy blue in the photo...so bewarned.  I am 5'4"" - 125 very athletic pounds.  bust is 34b / waist is 28inches...hips 37 inches.I bought the (very purple-y looking) blue in  small and a medium and the small fit great (hit mid thigh) and close and smooth to the body just  like in the photo here.The medium fit too, but was longer (to my knees) and had actual loose wrinkles aroundmy middle (which was okay - but wasn't smooth looking). If you have a real caboose in theback (junk in your trunk) and/or a ""rack"" that is impressive or a ""muffin top"": that you can't eat - order the M/L.  If you are lean and toned person my size go with the small. So, I returned the M/L andkept the small and ordered ALL the other colors in the small.  NOT sure exactly whathue they will be / I'll pick and choose and update this when they arrive. I plan to returnany others that don't float my boat and will update this review.

I usually wear and extra large so that‚Äôs what I ordered but it came and was too small to even get my arms in. Many others said to order the normal size you‚Äôd get but I would recommend ordering a size larger. I had no issues in returning this but I did order the size larger and have high hopes that it will fit. I love the color and look of the dress.EDIT: I got the larger sized dress and it was still a little snug but it stretched and got more comfortable the longer I wore it. I recommend a lot of patience when putting this dress on. At least for the arms. I have larger upper arms and it took a while to work the seam where it needed to be but that was the only complication I have. I had so many compliments about the color and style of the dress. I love it!!

I returned them in the packaging provided and dropped them off at the local station.  I asked if there was anything else I needed to do; and the girl at the counter said no.  I also order some shoes for myself.  Those I kept.  They are now trying to charge my credit card 160.00 for the pants.  If I still had the pants, I would authorize the charges..but, I don't have them.. nor does anyone else I'm associated with.  That was my first time using Amazon Prime; and based on this experience, I won't use them again.

The fit is flattering on many body types. I do advise to just be careful when using it. When it get's wet from  water, it will leave a light water mark on the dress until it is washed again. I used it for a wedding and water drops got unto it and my dress had light watermarks which was only noticeable if someone got really close. Otherwise, it would not be noticeable from afar. Overall, I would purchase this again in different colors because its a great basic, dressy dress to have in your closet for any occasion."

1154,Erin | erinnix.com,4.0,the United States ,"July 30, 2019","Cute, just not cute on me.","I am a pretty typical size medium, across the board. The medium in this dress was very wide across the chest and poked out below my underarms; it was obviously too big. It was also a little longer on me than pictured in the product photos, even when I adjusted the straps to try and make the dress shorter. I then ordered the small, which fixed all of my sizing issues. My only problem was still the length. I just could not make the dress hit at a flattering point on my leg, and the side slits were not helping to make the fit more flattering on my body type (athletic body type). I think I need something with a single front slit, so I ended up returning the small in this as well. I think this would look much better on people with a very slim body type.I will say the fabric was good quality and had a little bit of stretch to it. This did help me when I had to size down to the small, as it allowed room enough for my wider hips/butt."

It's soft, nicely made, stretchy, and fit me well. It's not something super dressy, but would be nice for an evening out, a dinner date/social ocassion, or for the office with a nice jacket. For ladies not built like bean poles, with real curves, may want to opt for shaperwear underneath. Since this is a bodycon dress it will not skim- but instead HUG- your body if you are more shape or self-conscious.Overall a nice dress for the price point. Recommend."

The listing made it look very elegant, especially in black. However, when it arrived and I tried it on, the lining was about a foot and a half shorter than the lace top layer. Even the top layer is quite a bit shorter than indicated online. I'm 5'3'' so generally maxi skirts are a true maxi, even with heels. While it could work for some people, it significantly changes the aesthetics of the dress. I even went back and looked at the listing to see if I was misremembering what I bought. I understand that quality can vary on Amazon but I think the basic look shouldn't be that drastically different. Will be returning."

The positive side was it came with plenty of fabric at the bottom and negative side was that it's not lined properly it cuts you in the wrong spot making everybody look fat I'm sure.The stress had a hole in it it was not well constructed at all.

The center that runs between the breasts is see through all the way to the waist band. The waist band is also see through with nothing behind the lace. There is a built in slip for the bottom 1/2 of the dress but it doesn‚Äôt cover the top 1/2. The front of my bra & my entire cleavage is visible through this dress.

1212,Jimmy Lee B.,2.0,the United States ,"June 5, 2022","Nice, but Too Big","This dress had exactly the sort of flowing, bohemian, comfortable look I prefer when I wear dresses. Part of that is because over the years, I've learned to compromise - since I'm just a little over five feet tall,  almost everything looks flowing and bohemian on me. (That's best case; worst case, I look like I'm wearing my grandmother's dress.)This dress, though, is just too large. I love the lace scallop at the hem, but I'd have to hem major inches off - losing that beautiful look (I don't even want to think about the cost of reproducing it). And the chest area, even though I went by the vendor's measurement chart, just hangs on me. But with no zipper, I'm not sure I could get a smaller size over my shoulders. If I were to try again, I also wouldn't order black - it's overwhelmingly funereal on me. Disappointing.The lace looks very attractive - up close, the edges are a little ragged, but the lace on the dress itself (apologies for the computer color changes) is very nice. If you've got more flexibility in your sizing, this would be a wonderful dress."

Only issues I had were the chest part was not lined which I did not know. It was see through in spots which came as a shock when I purchased. Also the dress fit a little bit so it hung in spots which wasn't a big deal, just made me look a little bigger than I truly am, but I didn't have time to return for a smaller size before our photos.

I usually am between a medium and a large but I hate when clothes are too small. The fabric is soft and smooth. It is not a stretchy fabric. It came to my ankles which I liked.

The shoulders were so out of sync that the seam attaching the sleeves was three inches below each of my shoulders. The dress has a high waist seam, and I've purchased this style in another brand with better material and better made. The material of this dress is a thin polyester and seemed cheap looking to me. However, it does not wrinkle, so I guess that's a plus."

I am an older woman with kind of a  large  bust line.  I ordered the largest size available.  When I open the package I couldn't wait to wear the dress, that is, until I tried to tug it over my bust line.  It was just to dang tight to wear comfortably or in public.  So disappointing!  Time to include larger women in your clothing line-up."

I returned the dress

He sent Jesus to die for lost sinners that they might be saved (John 3:16). Sinners are finally saved when they (a) believe in Jesus as the Son of God (John 3:16); (b) repent of their sins (Acts 2:38); (c) confess their faith in Christ with their mouths (Romans 10:10); and (d) are baptized ""for the remission (removal) of their sins"" (Acts 2:38)."

1325,East Coast Mom,2.0,the United States ,"October 29, 2022",Strange seam,"There is a strangely located seam just under the bust which made the rest of the dress sit strangely on the waist and then hips for me.  This is unfortunate, as the dress was lovely in a size small on me and was stretchy and comfortable but this seam also created a gap between my lower back and behind which made the dress fit improperly.  As far as I can tell the seam serves no purpose other than decoration and the dress would be better off without it."

1327,Shenayah Stanfield,2.0,the United States ,"May 3, 2022",Hella Short,"If you're tall like me (5 ft 10 in), then this will dress will probably be too short on you. The lace layer is a bit longer, but the layer below that barely covers my butt if I'm standing still. Any movement of my legs and the material rides up. Other than that, the dress was really nice. The lace wasn't scratchy or anything, and the dress looked good overall. It fit perfectly, other than being too short. One thing to note is that there is no zipper, so you have to pull it on over your head."

The dress is 63% polyester 34% cotton and 3% spandex. The fabric is thick and heavy not light and flowy as I imagined based on the description. It is a basic jersey knit dress with a tie front. It fits well and is cute but I am very disappointed in the fabric. It is described as being a bit more ""dressy"" than what it is, which is casual."
1337,Vykki,2.0,the United States ,"January 17, 2022",Beautiful Dress‚Ä¶Bad Delivery‚Ä¶Makeup Stained,"The dress I very cute and comfortable. I was highly frustrated to find it had been shipped in a plastic bag, wadded up in a soccer ball-like shape. Upon opening it, I found that it was super wrinkled (of course, given the ball it was delivered in), AND there was makeup across the front chest and neck area. So my supposed NEW dress wasn‚Äôt new at all, and it came stained and wrinkled. Im not happy at all, but the way things have been going lately with these sellers, I‚Äôm just going to clean it and make it work."
1338,Lindsey Dixon,2.0,the United States ,"September 28, 2021",Color was off,"Either I was sent the wrong color or the dress color is incorrect.  I ordered the ""green bean"" as it looked like a great color for a Fall wedding.  It was more of a light celery Spring green and I was not able to wear it.  Had it been a darker color it may have done a better job of hiding my imperfections but it really just amplified them, especially in the back.  Was not happy with this purchase and will be returning.  I think maybe another color would have worked which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1."

I am 5' 1"" so mostly everything is too long for me but not a problem! I had it hemmed and it was perfect. I had my son 9 months ago and I'm a little self conscious about my tummy. The wrap around the waist made me feel comfortable and accentuated the slimmer part of my torso. The fabric was just thick enough to keep me warm in chilly bay area weather. Overall a wonderful dress."

I contacted the seller about it, but they said Amazon shipped it so to contact Amazon. When I contacted Amazon, they were hardly helpful as well. They said that the return window closed so there would be a restocking fee to return the item. As if they could restock it. Also, when your dress falls apart, please make sure it is within the return window. I have worn this dress TWICE, for  a TOTAL of maybe 4 hours. One was for family pictures and the other for church. Nothing strenuous happed. The dress is simply sewn poorly.  I'm very disappointed with the quality of the dress and the customer support..Amazon is sending me a replacement and accepting the return, but I don't have much faith in the new one being better.

But when I tried it on, it was so tight and clung so much around the bust and especially the midsection that it was very unflattering. I ordered a Medium based on the size chart, but I should have sized up to Large.The material is quite a thin jersey knit, which makes the clinging worse. It‚Äôs not see-through, but it doesn‚Äôt have much drape, and won‚Äôt camouflage anything if it‚Äôs at all snug.Size up to avoid the unflattering midsection clinging."

It made me look like I had really fat upper arms due to the way the fabric was cut. If it was tighter by an inch or two, it would look much better. The shoulder hem line drops past the shoulders towards the arms (and I think it‚Äôs supposed to be that way), but the rest of the arm silhouette doesn‚Äôt become narrow until further down. It made me look like a weird balloon.3) The folded hem by the waist bulged out and made me look really frumpy, and it‚Äôs not because the sizing was off because the hip, waist, and chest area all fit.Good things about the dress:1) Very comfortable, cool, and lightweight fabric2) The tie part is flattering and I like how you can tie it in the front or back3) The dress has pockets!"
1376,Brandi,2.0,the United States ,"November 17, 2021",Perfect if you are looking for a Wives costume for A Handmaids‚Äô Tale costume,"Ordered the Dark Green in a size up (XL) from my normal size (L, normally wear a 12-14) after looking at measurements. The dress that came was definitely not dark green but Teal in color, the fit was snug but not too tight as the garment does have some stretch (not much) but not as loose fitting as photos I‚Äôve seen. I definitely felt I would need to wear Spanx with this dress. The cut is not flattering at all. It is very conservative. I could not wear it off the shoulder as the neckline was not cut long enough and it don‚Äôt have enough give, it sat more like a long boatneck, and showed my bra straps. I felt like a character from Handmaids Tale. If I wanted to dress up like Serena Joy, this would be the perfect costume, but not my intent with this purchase at all. Definitely returning ASAP."

When it arrived I was very happy as it was simple but cute. I ordered my normal size (small) which I‚Äôm 4‚Äô8‚Äù and 115 lbs and it is just a tad big but wearable. Unfortunately after having only worn it twice I noticed the seams along the waist tie are already separating and there is now a decent sized hole. I did attempt to tie the waist differently to cover it until I can sew it up and wear it again, it‚Äôs just disappointing to have to think I have to do that after only 2 wears. Definitely could‚Äôve been better. I have dresses I‚Äôve owned for YEARS with not a single hole or issue unlike this one. If not for that I‚Äôd have definitely given this more stars as it is a very cute and comfortable dress."

Besides the gross smell, it has these 2 pleats on the back and it just stook out and looked really weird. The belt also falls closer to your hips than your natural waist line. The fit was weird and the pleats just don't work."

You will need a body suit spanx not just the shorts/underwear kind or you will see it.

I haven‚Äôt been able to drop those 20 extra pounds I gained lately and was desperate.  It‚Äôs so flattering!  I felt comfy all night. Some shapewear, textured nylons, fancy jewelry and some heels and it took me to the cocktail party in style. Would not hesitate to buy it again."

1393,Amazon Customer,5.0,the United States ,"October 24, 2022",Dress is a win-win,"This dress is amazing! I do not typically write reviews, but I just needed to. I am very sensitive and need that cotton or rayon ( basically that natural feel of fabric on my skin) and that is what this dress is. Great feeling, amazing fit. I feel I can look like church-approved and if wanted to wear it in a date, dress it up and look va-va-voom! It‚Äôs a must buy. If I had the wallet, I would buy in more colors. So glad I went on a whim and bought! Got so many comment. Oh yeah the top is like a true boat neck so bra will peak out, or just need some crazy type of bra. I just wore the same color and it was ok. Try it, you will be happy. Measurements are 5‚Äô4&half, and like 130, but busty, so I got the M."
1394,Crystal,5.0,the United States ,"December 3, 2022",Good purchase,I purchased this dress for a funeral and I had to get it quickly which it did ship to me fast and the quality of this dress is very nice and elegant. I felt comfortable in this dress and fit nicely. I would order and try it out!
1395,Brenda S,5.0,the United States ,"December 5, 2022",Great fit,"Dress is very nice, did have to steam it to get wrinkles out but was not a problem. Size is what I expected, a little large through the hips but I'm slim in the hips bit it still looks very nice on."
1396,GirlRM,5.0,the United States ,"November 3, 2022",Very flattering!,"I am a petite lady at 4'11"", and this dress fits well and is very flattering! It hides my tummy pooch and somehow the back fat, too. The fabric is thick enough to skim rather than cling, which I appreciate. Lol, I thought I would share for the ladies with real bodies.  If you're thinking about trying this dress,  do it! The other people are right when they commented about the boat neckline.  You may need a strapless bra,  or just pin the straps so they don't try to peek out."
1397,Keara Woodrow,5.0,the United States ,"December 3, 2022",Flattering long dress,"Love this dress, bought for winter dress up occasions. I sized up to have a fit like the model, and it perfect!! I am 155lbs. 5‚Äô 5‚Äù bought a Large in Black"
1398,Sylvia,5.0,the United States ,"November 18, 2022",Great little dress. You can dress it up or down.,Love this dress. Wore it last night for the first time and it was a hit. It really hugs you and enhances your figure in the right places. It is a bit overpriced but worth it if you are in a pickle and don't have the time to go shopping.
1399,Kathleen King,5.0,the United States ,"December 6, 2022",Good fit,I'm about a 14 in regular pants sizes and a L or XL on top. The XL fit perfect and has tons of stretch. It also hides ny mom belly nice. I would recommend for sure! I'm also about 5'9 and it hits me about mid calf.

1401,Laura R.,5.0,the United States ,"October 20, 2022","Looks great on curves, give an hourglass shape","I love this dress! It‚Äôs the perfect style to be casual or dressed up. I really wanted a fall/ winter dress to wear with boots and this is perfect. It has long sleeves and the material is almost the look of a sweater but without the heavy weight. It‚Äôs a lightweight ribbed material that has a nice stretch to it. For reference I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù 118lbs measurements 32-26-38. I got the small and it fits really nice with a little bit of extra room in the bust on me.What I love is the style of this dress. The side draping looks great on curves and really accentuates and gives an hour glass shape. The draping also has a nice effect that hides the lower stomach area which when you‚Äôve had a baby is something I appreciate. The bottom has a asymmetrical hem which adds to the style and the length falls in between my ankles and knees, perfect for boots. I also really like that the neckline has a hides snap on the inside to keep the v neck from opening too wide. All in all I‚Äôm really happy with this dress, it looks great. I got the blue which is a medium shade of blue, sort of a French blue. And the dark khaki which is really a light brown/ taupe color."
1402,Honest Customer,5.0,the United States ,"November 27, 2022",I think I‚Äôll be buying another dress,"I like this dress a lot. I‚Äôm not sure how long the material will last because once it‚Äôs in a washing machine, it may develop lint balls. I hope not. I think I‚Äôll be buying a blue dress or burgundy dress. It fits nicely. It is a little longer than I wanted, but it‚Äôs cute. Instead of boots, I‚Äôll wear pumps with it."
1403,Shelby,5.0,the United States ,"November 11, 2022",Amazing!,"Got a size large, dark khaki, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù, about 160, 34H bra size, this dress fit great!! The neckline is the perfect depth, and there‚Äôs a small clasp to give more cleavage if you want, length for me hits a little below mid shin, and the whole dress is fairly form fitting without being too tight. The knot and layering of the fabric makes this dress super flattering, and becuase of the fabric and detailing, you can‚Äôt see shape wear underneath. Fabric is nice and stretch, and perfect thickness, planning to wear for a late fall/early winter wedding!"
1404,Lisa Dee,5.0,the United States ,"November 22, 2022",Love love love,This is a great flattering dress. It‚Äôs not too thin and not too heavy. It‚Äôs just right. I plan to wear to a holiday work dinner with black high boots. I‚Äôm 5 5 and 122 pounds and ordered the small. Fits perfect.

1431,Kaitlin,4.0,the United States ,"July 17, 2022",Good Dress for a Wedding Guest,"I am 6'0, 160#. I ordered a medium which fit pretty well but was a little snug around my backside and my chest. I didn't feel comfortable enough in the medium, I would've been pulling it down all night so I ordered the large. It was a little too big around the chest and waist, but it was more comfortable than the medium so I wore the large. I will say the shipping was fast which was appreciated, I got it just in time for the wedding. I was able to return the medium with no hassle so that was also a huge plus. I had so many compliments with the dress despite being a bit too big and I felt good in it. The material and stretch of the dress were comfortable. I wasn't pulling the top up or the bottom down all night. I had to wear a little bit of padding in the top as there is none in the dress. It is a cute little dress at a good price. I ordered the light blue dress and it was true to color. It comes in many other beautiful colors as well, it was a tough pick. However, my biggest complaint is that it doesn't have a clear strap on the strapless side to hang it up on a hanger! That would've been a great touch. With all this being said, I would recommend this dress for weddings or other dressier events."

If you‚Äôre looking for something that‚Äôs not form fitting, go up a size and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll still look great. A nice option of the belt not being attached, looks good with and without the belt. It‚Äôs about 2 inches above my knee. Definitely need to wear a bra with it, the entire dress is lightly lined. Can‚Äôt wait to wear it for a wedding"
1437,Mindy,4.0,the United States ,"October 2, 2022",Great buy,"The reviews said to size down but I disagree. I got a medium and it was a little snug and short, I‚Äôm 5 foot 150 lbs. Fabric texture felt great."

I'm a medium, company said I was medium, Amazon said I was a medium, I'm not a medium in this dress. It could barely be zipped up & I looked like a sausage. Also ordered a large and that's too small. I could keep the large if I wanted something too low cut and open on top (for me but some people like something that low cut and open) & that much exposed thigh (again that's me, some people like that look.). If this was for a hot date then maybe I would keep it. Maybe. It's not, it's for a wedding so both the large & medium are going back."
1471,melody,2.0,the United States ,"July 20, 2022",Almost loved it,"I almost loved this dress. Purchased for a wedding and wore it once. It fit very nicely and was flattering. I'm 5'7 so the shortness of it made be constantly readjust during the day. But then eventually the seems on the side tore. Thankfully I was wearing black shapewear so no skin wad showing. But for what I paid for the dress it's not worth it to send out for repairs. I also bought the largest size thinking so I can't even swap for a bigger size. I think it was beautiful, but just not for all body types."

Amazon suggested an XL. I ordered the XXL. Shoulders, breasts, waist and hips were crammed into this dress. Of course I never attempted to zip the side zipper. My husband helped me remove the dress. I feel this dress runs at least 2 sizes too small.The fabric will keep you warm if you plan on wearing this dress in the summer. The dress is not lined, but it is not see through."
1477,Amy B,2.0,the United States ,"June 24, 2022","Pretty dress, odd fit","I bought this in both a M and a L.  Neither fit correctly.  The M was way to short for my 5'9"" frame.  The L fits, but the 'wrap' and tie cinch up under the bust, closer to the armpit rather than the waist like the picture shows, and where the ties come together is not on the seam as the picture shows, making it look really ill-fitting.  I returned the M and I'll be returning the L as well."

I‚Äôve had GREAT luck. Until today. I wanted this dress to fit so badly. An XL did me no good. I would have had to order a XXXXL. Also, if it fit, it would have been drastically too short. The slit was not sexy. It was damn near showing all my lady bits. Bummer."
1480,F Edwards,3.0,the United States ,"December 3, 2022",Not for short ladies,"I had high hopes reading all the reviews, but this dress was just a bit too loose on me to be able to comfortably wear in public.  It would have probably been perfect in an XS, but alas, the smallest size is S.  I am 4‚Äô 11‚Äù, 100 lbs and the top was a bit loose and the hem hit way below my knees.

1481,Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States ,"June 20, 2022",BAYER BEWARE!,"I bought this dress in ivory floral. Right side of crisscross the fabric shows my bra color. On the left side where fabric is double because of the crossover fabric is not showing my bra. It looks bad and I would not wear something that is looking so bad. I wanted to send it back the next day, although when I purchased Amazon shows ""free return"" when I started the returned I found out that I WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO SHIP IT BACK. Make sure you know item fits you well before buying, if not be aware of shipping charges. Ps: my previous review on this item was denied by Amazon saying that I have to review the product and not the seller. I hope this 2nd review will get approved because this is about how the item looks and also about the fact that the return policy displayed by Amazon is misleading. Thank you!Update 6/23/22:3rd party seller customer service was wonderful. They gave me 2 options and both were very reasonable. I just want everyone to know in advance that this dress is nice, maybe in a solid color and definitely not ivory floral which is creating the problem I mentioned. Fabric is good quality, not  thin. If it were not a crisscross design at the chest but same single fabric on both sides this might have worked for me, but with only one side one way and different on the other side it wasn't looking good. So, I do recommend this dress but definitely in a darker color, and be aware of the return policy."

It fit ok on the waist, but the chest was much too baggy. Also, I appreciate a puffy, billowy sleeve, but these paired with an unfitted top made the dress look like it was swallowing me. I decided not to reorder smaller though because I did not care for the dots, my husband and I agreed that they made the dress look more like it had a disease than it looked like Swiss dot. I also would have needed to wear a cami underneath it because the V-neck came down too low. On the plus side, the fabric has a nice, heavy drape, and I loved the blue color."

The chest, waist, and sleeve length are true to size, but if you are taller than probably 5'4"", this dress will be too short. The picture depicts this dress as full length - as in touching the floor - but in reality, it was at least 4 to 5 inches too short. I am 5'8"" and even with bad posture, this dress stopped just passed the middle of my shin. Also, the elastic around the upper waist was weird and uncomfortable. I liked the fabric, and the color was ok, but the shortness of the length made this dress extremely unflattering on me. I returned it immediately."

The fabric is soft and stretchy, but the way it‚Äôs sown screams ‚ÄúMade in China‚Äù‚Ä¶ It is indeed very see through.  Even with a bra, garment, and slip, it‚Äôs a no for me!

1515,DonnieDidIt,1.0,the United States ,"September 19, 2022",Poorly made and super uncomfortable fabric and elastic,"I ordered this dress in two colors and intentionally larger than I would usually order, or so I thought. I wanted these dresses to use for costumes for Halloween, and even then, I had to reject them both. The material is weirdly uncomfortable and was so stretchy, it was almost clownish. Even though the dresses were too large for me as I admittedly ordered, the sleeves were tight at the seams, and at the same time were extraordinarily long. The elastic in the dresses which I assumed would be at about an empire position based on what I saw online, was in fact almost around my waist and I am not particularly short-waisted. Also, I am 5'6 and I had to lift the hem in order to walk, the dresses were so long. I have the dresses packed with the appropriate label, ready to return. What a waste of time and energy."

1520,Annelisa,1.0,the United States ,"April 7, 2021",Waiting for the wrinkles to fall out!  Maybe size down on this one.,"I love the dress, however,I ordered a small ; I'm 5' 6.5"" tall and max 110 lbs or less.  I ordered the Small rather than X-Small because I have long arms and legs so dresses are often too short in length and sleeve length.  The dress fit in the chest, and the sleeves are plenty long.  My problem is the top pulls down, first, I'm a 34AA so the dress is not stretched in the bust area.  I think the weight of the dress combined with my small bust size pulls the top down and feels awkward.What I don't like with the dress is how it arrived.  Wrinkles like you wouldn't believe, truly, looked like something in a bag of old clothes for a long time.  I don't want to wash the dress and hang it to dry since I will be returning for an X-Small.

Some reviewers complained about the fleece type lining but I didn't find it to be a heavy lining, it was soft and it's a very comfortable dress.  I would definitely encourage you to purchase it!  I'm a true 10/12 M/L and I ordered the large and it fit perfectly.  It is form fitting but the material is stretchy.  I'm also 5'11"" and it hit right below my ankles so if you're shorter this may be too long."

The material in the back is one thin layer and emphasizes every bump and roll you have.  I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs gotten such high reviews.  The elastic neck looks exactly like the neck of some baby doll clothes just cinched around with no style to it and very unflattering"

The navy color looks like an off black and has brown buttons. It doesn‚Äôt match the buttons and looks like a uniform. If you get this dress, imagine it with brown buttons when choosing your color. Other than that, this is a nice dress. Wish they sent me the lighter green instead of the navy."

I ordered the black dress and the buttons are brown. I didn‚Äôt notice at first but in the day light is glaringly obvious and makes the dress look cheap.
1662,Tboz,5.0,the United States ,"December 4, 2022",This dress is awesome,"This dress is so flattering and comfortable! Got in XL in black so buttons wouldn‚Äôt be pulling around breast area and it fits excellent. You can button it up or unbutton for a sexier option giving you options to wear professionally or for a night out on the town with the girls! The fabric is soft, easy to iron on medium heat. Sleeve length is long and I like that because usually things are too short on me. The silk material is silky on the outside and the interior is lined with a soft polyester/cotton soft stretchy material.  The wide belt is versatile you can tie it to the back or front for it to frame your waist. The gathered front is sexy and forgiving to the tummy area. I love it and will be ordering more colors!"
1663,BSprklz,5.0,the United States ,"December 5, 2022",Chic and comfortable,"The fabric is really great on this one.

1665,Bre,5.0,the United States ,"December 6, 2022","So elegant, comfortable & fitted!",This dress was everything I was hoping it would be.

First off the quality is amazing. Sometimes satin/silk materials feel cheap but this is super soft and not see through. Feels and looks very luxurious.I‚Äôve worn the black to work with white sneakers and had the front in a bow. Then I wore the navy to date night and just tied the front together for a flowy look. Can‚Äôt wait to wear there green, khaki, and burgundy.It washes very well and I hung dry with no issues. I feel like it would be fine with the dryer on low heat.I feel like it works for errands, work, and casual dates if the sleeves are rolled. However would be perfect for wedding look with the sleeves kept long.I‚Äôm 34DDD and was concerned for the top but there was plenty of room. The band around the rib cage has a little bit of stretch so if your between sizes I suggest getting the size that you lean more towards.Love, love!5,2ht, 139lbs, 34DDD, SZ small/Medium but purchased a small in this dress."

The fabric is nice and stretchy, so the dress is very comfortable and you're able to move and sit without feeling constricted. It's also thicker so you don't have to worry about it being see through and it doesn't show your unwanted lines or bumps. There is a side zipper to help get into the dress easier, but because it's so stretchy it comes on and off easily. The length of the dress is also perfect if you're on the shorter side like me!

Purchased a medium after reading reviews. Was able to zipper dress up, but dress was still small.Purchased the beautiful blue color, the color was just as the picture and it comes with a belt. Top part of dress: The dress does have a slight scrunch elastic band under the arm of one shoulder which was super nice so arm doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs being choked, super comfortable and unexpected feature, but the dress was just super paper thin; just another silk slip so there‚Äôs no support. Zipper did zip from the side as well. Bottom half of dress: The bottom is meant for toothpick thin girls. It is Not whatsoever flattering for ladies with hips. The V bottom that is shown in picture does Not lay to the side, it sits straight in front, and since hips stretch it out, your hoohah will be shown to the world. The V bottom dress will open, even when you‚Äôre just standing still. The material feels nice against the skin though, but this did Not work for me, and returned."

Before I left I noticed a small black spot on the back so tried to wash it out with warm water. The water created a ring outline that wouldn‚Äôt go away. Also noticed some spots/outlines where I had leaned against a wet counter. (Yes, I gave them time to dry.) It had also started to show sweat stains before I left the house. I‚Äôm not an overly sweaty person, so just decided to skip this one and go with my alt. Maybe not the best fabric for a hot Texas summer event.

1738,MrsSmith661,5.0,the United States ,"November 16, 2022",All the yes! Sizing and fit details below,I typically order size L in things because I am a 34DD and I have a long torso on top of that. Being 5‚Äô6 my legs are on the shorter side so everything is long on my bottom half. I opted for a M in this dress and I regret nothing! The tie really helps to create a flattering waist/figure. The dress itself is not lined but it is thick enough fabric it doesn‚Äôt need to be lined. The slate blue is a gorgeous shade. I steamed the dress the night before our event and let it hang and it lasted well.

I ordered the xxl and possibly could‚Äôve gotten the xl! Sooo many compliments on this dress!I‚Äôm normally a 14ish pants, xl-xxl top.

1741,Laura,5.0,the United States ,"November 16, 2022",So comfortable and fits true to size. Love!,"I really loved this dress and might order it in another color. It was exactly what I needed for a friend‚Äôs wedding- I wanted to look nice, but not super fancy or sexy (I‚Äôm 37). My favorite dress I‚Äôve ordered from Amazon in a while- and it fit true to size- I typically wear a large and the large fit really well. Highly recommend 10/10!"
1742,kelly,5.0,the United States ,"November 21, 2022",10/10 YES,The quality of it for Amazon was actually amazing. I expected it to come in and be some thin horribly made silk dress.

The dress is too large (47 inches long vs 44 inches which is what it should be for an XS). The tag inside the dress says XS so I'm not sure if this was the designer's fault, but at any rate, it was too large for me so I returned the dress. For reference, I normally wear size 0 or 2 in dresses."

Way longer than pictured (I'm 5'6""), the sleeves were too long on me & I have really long arms. The fit was just really odd. I have 34Ds and it was tight in the chest, but loose in the back and fitted in the bottom half, but way too much excess material for the cross over portion (the bow did not look good like it does in the photos). Wouldn't recommend for someone with a body shape like mine. I got a medium and I'm a size 4-6."

When I removed it from the package my husband agreed that the material was cheap and looked poorly made. It fit okay but was not as flattering as other people made it out to be.

I ordered the camel and darker (Army?) green for an October wedding. The dresses arrived quickly, and were individually folded into a sealed bag in the shipping bag. Win! As I took the first one out I was impresses with the feel and thickness of the fabric, as well as the vibrancy of the color. Win!  I tried the dress on and it was very comfortable, however I struggled and tried every tie position possible to make it sit right... and I just couldn't. The top was super baggy and unflattering (maybe my chest is too small) as was the elastic on the back.  No matter which place I tied the ties, it pulled the sides of the dress forward and did not look even or flattering. Reluctantly, I had to return both. I didn't have time to try to size down, as I had hoped to wear to a wedding that was only 3 days after I received the dresses. And the size chart made me believe the dress would not be long enough in. Medium for my tall frame. I had ordered the large for that reason."
1771,AmazonShopaholic,4.0,the United States ,"December 7, 2022",Weird fit if you are short waisted and petite,"Super cute dress! Blue was a dusty, subdued blue‚Ä¶pretty and the fabric felt nice. Wish there was an XS. I‚Äôm short, shirt waisted, and small chest and it just got weird around my waist and tying it tighter meant it billowed funny in the back. If you‚Äôre a bit talker it gave a great chest to fill it out I bet it works better, but I‚Äôm sadly going to have to return."
1772,Jack's Wifey ,4.0,the United States ,"December 2, 2022",Not exactly as pictured,"Looks a bit less finished in person, the stiting is a bit raised.  It's very balloon like, I would size down.

It fits perfectly in the bust, a tad tight in my shoulders (as expected), and the tie can be worn in many different ways to look more casual or professional. I love it! It took a few weeks to get here, but with plenty of time to spare before my event!"

3,Kathryn,1.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"November 8, 2021",It shows everything!!,"This dress is terrible, you think it‚Äôs cute until you actually try to wear it. Do not buy it. First of all there was a stain on it that of course I noticed after I clipped the tag off. I brought this to a destination wedding for one of the events during the weekend. When I put the dress on and saw myself in the hotel lighting, not only could you see every wrinkle in my bum through the fabric, you could also see every sweat mark and lotion. It truly was wild to see and disheartening. The fabric is just awful. Save your money and get something higher quality."

I love the adjustable straps and the length and cut allows it to be super versatile! Very easy to dress up or wear with sneakers, all season lbd, and could be layered or worn on it's own. Equally stylish as it is comfortable.After 1 gentle wear, I washed it and followed the washing instructions to the T - cold, gentle, like colors (washed with a couple pairs of yoga pants) and hung to dry. And BUMMER- a tread snagged/broke!! Right in the front! FIRST wash!I realize this is an affordable dress of this style, but for what I paid I expected to get more than 1 wear out of it.So even after loving and receiving multiple compliments on this dress, I don't recommend purchasing."

I immediately returned the dress. 1) the actual lining was longer than the outer material?! 2) the length was a mini dress not below the knee. 3) there was no split on the sides like the picture. 4) the material was not the same as the description. 5) The dress I received was a scope (round) neck not V.

One a size 3 XL and the other a 4 XL.  I am a 2 XL thinking that one of these would fit. I was wrong. the 4XL problably is a size 16.  This is crazy. So I put in for a product return. It said the buyer had to approve the return. Ok I got the approval back in 15 min. But I have to have a lable from the buyer as to where to send these dresses back.

I don't have a problem with purchasing a returned item, as long as it has been laundered appropriately and the seller has noted this is a used item.Other than the stain, I am impressed with the quality of material.

I was impressed with the quality it actually felt like a higher end brand. The color was gorgeous and fit was as expected. I‚Äôm a size 14 in bottoms and large is tops; 36DD and the size large fit perfect. Was afraid to get the xl because I‚Äôm smaller framed up top and couldn‚Äôt afford to shop around if this dress didn‚Äôt work. Would totally recommend!

I also loved how soft it felt and liked that it didn't wrinkle up at all and it absorbed my perspiration- It was a hot day and I was worried about it,  so that was a relief!).Not sheer at all. Does not give in, so choose wisely. I am 5.9 and about 180 lbs. and got an XL because I needed room for the bust and can tailor it if needed but ran out of time. It was a perfect fit from the bust but it lifted the waist. I felt it went too high for my liking. (It could have been from the volume on my bust) As you can see in the picture, the waist wrap was at my waist but the dress was higher and that bothered me. At the hips it felt a little loose but didn't mind that. I was confident the dress looked good on me. I was able to walk comfortably without worrying about the front opening too much, too. I got many compliments that special day where I was a guest to a wedding which was held outdoors in the hot weather and a sweet 16 which was inside.I don't think a large would have fit. I will buy again with enough time to tailor it."

But this one felt so nice. The fabric is good quality and the size is good too.  I am large busted so I ordered an xl and it fit perfect. There does seem to be a little gap in the armpit/breast area.  Highly unusual for me (36G)  I'm not sure about the sleeveless look for me and how to best wear a bra ect.  The slit is nice but doesn't flap open.  You can sit down in the dress without it opening up.  I was concerned it may be an open wrap but it is not.  If you are looking for a reasonably priced dress that is flattering and feels like wood quality you should give this one a try.

Purchased for a wedding, but ended up returning. The color is beautiful, and was exactly what I was looking for in that aspect, but the fit was disastrous. It was far from flattering and I am a pretty average size and build (5'8"", ~150lbs, size 6/8). The cowl neck top would not lay right across my d√©colletage, and the dress itself just looked frumpy and fit poorly. Also was very very very wrinkled. I am not sure if those wrinkles would have come out even with an iron, definitely not with a steamer alone. Ugh! This dress was such a disappointment!"

No wrong. The material was so soft and loved the color but when I tried it on it looked like a rag on me. Gave me no shape at all and the neck part looked like it was just stretched out and didn't look flattering at all. The straps were so thin that I thought they would break.

I returned it and got a refund. Waste of time and partly traumatized."

Loved it. Wanted every color. They got me.So I ordered a green one that looked the same but didn't have the slit. This one was not even a dress, just a thin sheer wrinkled fabric with no shape, like a tube of cloth with straps at the end. Luckily Amazon is great about returns.Then tried to order a red version of the blue dress I loved so much, made sure the label was the same, the photo was the same and should've been the same dress, just red. I received a near neon pink dress that was also completely different, this one with fabric quality somewhere between the first two, but the cut was so narrow at the chest that my boobs can fall out the sides and the bottom hem was not even finished, with a bundle of red thread hanging off the side seam."

I was so excited to get it, but it does NOT live up to its reviews. It‚Äôs paper thin, very clingy and static-y, and the cowl neck is awful looking. It also has a strip of fabric inside along the bust that goes straight across about 2‚Äù under my nipples and because the fabric is so thin, is SUPER obvious. My underwear band is super noticeable too.  I bought the black so ‚Äúlumps‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt be so obvious, but in this dress, EVERYTHING is obvious. I‚Äôm so bummed! All those people who said it was thick material got a different dress than I did! It only looks nice if you bend over, stick your butt out and pose, but I can‚Äôt walk around doing that!:) I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù, 145 and I ordered a medium with no slit."

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù and 120lbs, so I expect things to not fit properly. I ordered the small and it was far too big in the chest, waists, and hips. Additionally, it also seemed to be sewed‚Ä¶ almost crooked? I ordered the wine red with a split, and the split needed up at the back of my leg instead of the side, and the dress felt like it was tugging and trying to twist around me. Overall, I probably will not order another in a smaller size for that reason alone. It felt a little wonky to me"
37,Byron,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"December 7, 2022",Missed the Mark,"Dress came quickly and color nice and vibrant as pictured. Unfortunately, doesn‚Äôt want to fit right. Seems as though the stitching is off center such that when wearing the dress, the hem on one side is much farther back making the whole dress pull to one side."
38,Jacob Stephens,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"November 21, 2022",Seams not symmetrical,The dress fit as expected. One side hugged my waist and hips nicely and the other side had a weird empty angle that stuck out. The seams weren‚Äôt symmetrical when you laid the dress flat. I considered ordering the exact same dress to see if it was just that specific dress but ended up going with a different option.
39,DL üêâ ,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"December 30, 2021",Weird fit for 5‚Äô4‚Äù with shorter torso,"As someone who‚Äôs 5‚Äô4‚Äù 130lb 32DD with athletic body type, I‚Äôll start by saying I don't expect most things to fit super well. I was looking for an affordable dress for an upcoming wedding (dressy casual), so this looked like it had potential, but I had low expectations.I actually liked the material of the dress. It‚Äôs definitely not silk, but the rich, emerald green color and shine tricks the eye and makes the dress appear way fancier than its price tag. I have an inverted triangle shape body (broad shoulders), but the fit of the dress was flattering overall from the front. I actually didn‚Äôt really have any weirdness in the hip area as others have described.That‚Äôs where the positives stop.  If you zoom in on specific parts of the dress, you‚Äôll see weird fit. The ‚Äúdrape‚Äù across the top just didn‚Äôt work on me. I did get an S, and I think a medium would‚Äôve just looked like a bag on me. Also, I do have a shorter torso, but the back waist kept bunching up no matter what I did (see picture). Other slip dresses I‚Äôve tried (anthro, regular non-petite sizes) did not have the same problem, making me think this is a build problem, not just my body type. Also, the dress I received didn‚Äôt have a slit on the side even though the order is for a ‚Äúmidi slit‚Äù dress.Overall, for the cost, this dress is quite good. However, any tailoring costs to fix the weird bunching issues would cost more than the dress itself which is why I decided to return it. For those who are taller (maybe 5‚Äô6‚Äù+ or with a longer torso), I‚Äôd recommend it if you‚Äôre in a bind and need a dress asap."

Didn‚Äôt look bad but I wasn‚Äôt comfortable in it. I put on shape wear and you could see the lines, honestly only a little bit still. I wore it as a tank top and put a skirt over it. Super cute! The main problem is‚Ä¶. There were at least 4 other people at the wedding in this dress. I was mind blown. Glad I put the skirt on. Worth a shot. Definitely gives sexy night gown vibes though."

Bought the extra small in orange and boy: this fits me in a very shapeless, saggy way.It‚Äôs COMFORTABLE, it‚Äôs lightweight, it has plenty of stretch and wasn‚Äôt sheer or see-thru, but it‚Äôs just SADLY SHAPELESS (and long on my short frame).It‚Äôs going back, sadly. If there were an XXS I‚Äôd be all over it (tho the cowl neck is a little wide if you‚Äôre petite. felt like it didn‚Äôt know where to drape or fold)."
42,Mallory,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"November 14, 2022",Great fit but fabric was too metallic.,"This dress fit beautifully; however, the satin-like fabric appeared too shiny and metallic for my liking."
43,Ruby ,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"October 11, 2021",Cheap thin material and poorly put together,"Honestly, in a pinch, this dress will do the job. It's shiny and looks pretty, color is a nice emerald green like in the listing.But the material is very thin, obviously just one layer. It comes folded so the folds are still very obvious on the dress, but I didn't iron/steam it so I don't know if that would fully fix things. The right strap had strings unwinding and coming off of it which speaks to the poor quality. The sides are sewn in a way that I can't tell if it's intentional or not. It sort of gives the illusion of curves (???) but it also just looks like it could have been a sewing mistake so it's squiggly. The worst part though is probably the chest area. It's supposed to have a nice cowl neck, but the execution is just not good. It gapes open so you can't lean forward too much unless you're okay with your boobs completely showing, or you just have to keep pushing and pinching your neckline in every few minutes to make sure it's still in place.For $22 I would've expected slightly better quality - obviously, $20 is not much. But I've definitely gotten better dresses for around that amount. The one upside is the dress does look deceptively good in pictures, though, so if that's all you care about then you'll probably be fine with this."

When I had it on correctly it felt like it was off the the side like pulling a certain way like the seam might be off centered? I‚Äôm not sure, but it looks good, despite that feeling lol(Bust- 34, waist-24, hips- 35)"

The slit sits right at the side and almost towards the back, which is odd. Plus, it was a bit tight in my hips and I had to keep twisting it around. Otherwise, I received a lot of compliments, mostly involving the word ""stunning"" so it was a win for me. The fabric ""pulls"" very easily though, and I think the dress is no longer wearable."

Sadly I was correct. The fabric is good quality and the color is true to the picture (It looks like a diff color in my pic only bc of the lighting in my room). I am very skinny and this dress accentuated that. If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going for then great - this dress will be a good option. However there was a bubble of fabric on my left hip of just empty space bc I don‚Äôt have hips to fill it out! Will be returning but the actual dress is decent.

It‚Äôs definitely the neckline. The slit was higher and was sewed off centered so it doesn‚Äôt sit right and spins a little. Slightly annoying but still looks good. The length is below the knee so it‚Äôs attractive and still sexy. Great purchase
54,Emily Phillippe,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"October 22, 2022",Fit,The shoulders were quite broad. Considering it has a satin material it does have some stretch to it. Not much. But a little stretch. Great color. i do think if you had a slightly bigger chest you could fit this dress better. I am only a B cup and the neck line didn‚Äôt know how to lay. But if you were to fill out the dress more the fit would be more appealing.

I will say, it hugged my stomach where you could see my belly button when I had nothing on under it, so I ordered some shapewear and that helped a ton!

Purchased split black in XL.Y‚ÄôALL- I‚Äôve been wanting to hop on board the satin slip dress train for a while, but I‚Äôve been nervous to pull the trigger because it‚Äôs hard to tell on the internet if the satin is decent quality, and because I‚Äôm curvy and self conscious about my tummy.Let me tell you, one pair of spanx and this dress later I felt like a freakin bombshell, which is amazing because I currently have the lowest body confidence I‚Äôve had in years. Husband was drooling.Fabric- this satin is pretty thick and a little stretchy, which was a pleasant surprise. Definitely not see through, and I was able to comfortably sit through a three hour opera. Has a very nice shine, but definitely does not look cheap. The stitching is well done and the straps are STURDY. The zipper should probably be a little more heavy duty, and there is no hook and eye, so I will be adding one in future to help get the zipper up. Once it was zip everything was great, but the satin is slippery so I had to have my husband do the actual zipping while I helped hold the sides together. But for $30? Don‚Äôt even care.Fit- this dress went about 3‚Äù below my knees while standing, and sat just above my knees when sitting.  The waist is very fitted, but the hips allow a lot of space. It was wild, it looked tailored right of the packaging. The bust area fit really well, and the fabric is sturdy enough that I was able to comfortably wear this dress without a bra. The ladies were supported, not squished, and I wasn‚Äôt worried about the nips. The slit is towards the back of the dress, which I didn‚Äôt realize looking at the pictures, but I actually really like it! It‚Äôs just behind my left leg, and when sitting, you might not notice there‚Äôs a slit at all.Note- not sure how this dress would fit on a slimmer body type, because I don‚Äôt have one- the neckline would probably slouch in a really pretty way on a smaller chest like in the pics, but the hips might bag, it‚Äôs hard for me to tell.Just purchased in the rust color as well, this is going to be my go to wedding guest outfit this summer! It rides the perfect line between casual and formal. I cannot believe I got this stunner for such a great price. Buy it!Will absolutely update with photos, unfortunately forgot to get a pic!"

One sleeve seems to be twisted and much smaller than the other.  It was so tight that I couldn't even move it on my arm to try to straighten the seam.  And, it's not tea length as the model displays.  I'm 5'7"" and it was to my feet.  The fabric is nice and has a good weight to it.  I need a dress like this.

It did the trick, but the fit was different from how it looks on the model. I‚Äôm a C cup, & the fabric across the chest was too loose.

27,Stephanie Wukovitz,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"December 4, 2016",Waistband rode up over my bust when I raised my arms -- and stayed there.,"I'm 5'4"", 35-28-39, with shoulders wider than hips, long and slender arms, high bust, short waist, fairly narrow ribcage, a disproportionate amount of my weight carried in the hips and buttocks but not thighs.  In knits with this much spandex I usually take a women's small or medium (long sleeves, XS or S (short sleeves), XS (sleeveless).  An empire waist that's fitted through most of the torso looks great on my kind of figure.  Reading the reviews, I decided to get a medium, a size larger than average for me.But... after putting this dress on, I couldn't grab enough fabric on the upper part of the sleeve to rotate it into the right position.  Yup, it was that tight.  After much struggling I finally wrestled the sleeves into position and looked in the mirror -- great from every angle, with substantial fabric, and rich, flattering colors (green and wine red each look nice with pale olive skin and dark brown hair).  However, the waistband rode up over my bust when I raised my arms -- and stayed there.  Hilarious.So yeah, I'm exchanging it for an XL (same size I usually need when buying non-stretchy tops) but I'm concerned that the fit in the waist will be terrible and that my ability to insert back darts won't be up to the job of handling a thick knit fabric like this.  Fingers crossed.(Dress is awesome enough otherwise for me to give a much larger size a try.  I may up this rating to 4 stars if the XL manages to be flattering on me despite the huge-for-me waist measurement listed.)-----Update:  Inserting back darts (look up ""swayback alteration"") did help in making the dress conform nicely to my ribcage.  I got a lot of compliments at the holiday party I wore this to!However, my housemate, who pinned them for me and volunteered to do the sewing so I could get some sleep, took a bit of poetic license with fabric type and left me a note: ""Was up until 3am removing cat hair.  Never let this touch carpet.  Kitchen floor is swept and probably the safest place to put on/off.  Perhaps avoid the Satan [sic] Fabric in the future unless an automatic hair remover is included.""A little unfortunate since this company's scoopneck/princess seamed version of this dress in wine was already on its way to me, but a point well taken -- you might want to skip the velvet garments, at least THIS velvet, if you own two long-haired cats, if you haven't already figured such things out for yourself :)"
28,Nouvelle H√©lo√Øse,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"January 17, 2019","Shoulder area incorrect, arms hang backward","I used to sew professionally.  Here's my educated opinion:Pros:--Fabric is of a good weight.  I've worked with lusher stretch velvet, but perhaps a medium weight is better for this dress, as it might get too heavy with a more plush material.--Color is beautiful.  I wish I could find this green more often, and it's largely why I bought this dress.--Sewing quality is pretty good.--No weird smells.  It has a light ""new fabric"" smell, but I'd be comfortable wearing this right out of the box, and I have a sensitive nose.--Seems like the fabric and construction make this a dress that could be machine-washed easily.  (One of the great things about stretch velvet.)The big con:--The construction around the shoulder is off.  The back appears to be slightly longer than the front, draped section, and so even on a hanger, the shoulder seam rests just in front of the top of the hanger.  The front of the dress doesn't seem like it was build to contain much of a chest--and I'm only a 36C, so far from ""busty""--and so my breasts then pull the seam forward a bit more.  The sleeves were set as though the shoulder seam is the top, and so the sleeves actually hang backward slightly.  On the hanger, I didn't see this tilt, but put the dress on a moderately-shapely woman like me and it became obvious.  I see this flaw in some of the other customer photos as well.  The dress looks great flat on the table, but the human body is not flat as a table.Yeah, it's probably minor to 99% of the people looking at this dress, and it's not something I normally would notice, if I saw someone else wearing it.  It does, however, really irk me.  I could reset the sleeves, but as the entire dress appears to be built by serger, I think it'd be more trouble than it's worth.  I'll probably just return the dress."

I have larger upper arms and it took a while to work the seam where it needed to be but that was the only complication I have. I had so many compliments about the color and style of the dress. I love it!!

I returned them in the packaging provided and dropped them off at the local station.  I asked if there was anything else I needed to do; and the girl at the counter said no.  I also order some shoes for myself.  Those I kept.  They are now trying to charge my credit card 160.00 for the pants.  If I still had the pants, I would authorize the charges..but, I don't have them.. nor does anyone else I'm associated with.

It was heavier and didn't show as sheer unless moving in a well lit room.But the main reason I want to return the evening pants is the flimsy waist band elastic.  Poor quality elastic was used.

The dress would have been prettier if it had been more silky, but for the price, it is stunning.  It is not sheer at all.  I wore a slip, but not because the dress was thin.

I ha this quickly altered down the sides for more fit at the bust and waist. With a high compression underpinning like Spanx, it works! I have worn it two times, in five days.Like another review stated, water will leave a spot. But, I washed this inside out and hung it dry and water and food spot came out. To release the wrinkles, I threw in the dryer for a minute on medium heat.For the price point, this is a great dress, can wear with sneakers and heels.

It‚Äôs definitely perfect for a dressy event with a necklace and earrings, over a T-shirt for something more casual or under a cute sweater for a holiday party. The fit is flattering on many body types. I do advise to just be careful when using it. When it get's wet from  water, it will leave a light water mark on the dress until it is washed again. I used it for a wedding and water drops got unto it and my dress had light watermarks which was only noticeable if someone got really close. Otherwise, it would not be noticeable from afar.

The medium in this dress was very wide across the chest and poked out below my underarms; it was obviously too big. It was also a little longer on me than pictured in the product photos, even when I adjusted the straps to try and make the dress shorter. I then ordered the small, which fixed all of my sizing issues. My only problem was still the length. I just could not make the dress hit at a flattering point on my leg, and the side slits were not helping to make the fit more flattering on my body type (athletic body type). I think I need something with a single front slit, so I ended up returning the small in this as well. I think this would look much better on people with a very slim body type.I will say the fabric was good quality and had a little bit of stretch to it. This did help me when I had to size down to the small, as it allowed room enough for my wider hips/butt."

Even though I read a ton of reviews so I could figure out what size would work best, this dress still surprised me in a good way.  I usually run between sizes (S, M) and I went with a medium in the velvet green dress.  I am 5'8"", 134 lbs, with a slightly muscular/lean build.  This dress lays really well on the body.  With the added belt it looks even better.  I'm sure it could be dressed up even more with a fancier belt if needed.  The cap sleeves are flattering (even if you have broad shoulders, like I do), fit comfortably, and cover normal bra straps.  No special bra needed, but it still flatters ladies with smaller chests!  The inner top was lined, but the skirt was not.  I will probably wear it with a slip.  I will be wearing this dress tonight and I will try to update my review with a photo.  I am so happy with this purchase, especially at the $40ish price tag.Edited on 11/29/22 with attached image:I have already worn this dress twice and I still LOVE it!

It's loose in the belly area and is perfect there. I have small shoulders and this thing is tight on me in the shoulders. The fabric is weird. Most flannels are soft inside and out. This is soft only on the outside. Feels plastic-y on the inside. I'd have to wear something under this for it to be comfortable.

I have a short torso and the waistline is higher than my waistline, which was awkward. It's also very loose in the chest and shoulders (I'm a 34A).

I should mention that I like knee length or just above the knee dresses, so it might not be too short for others. The fabric is nice, actual flannel type.

The length of the dress was good in my opinion, not overly short or too long, which is important for a shorter person. The chest area was a bit tight, which meant it was a bit tight in the arms/across my back when lifting my arms up & you can see in my pics how it bunched up/pulled a little bit, but it could have been solved with a black camisole under it. It felt like true flannel, the one kinda odd thing was that the sleeves didn‚Äôt have the typical flannel shirt cuff to it. I still thought it was cute though. I had bought this to potentially wear to a family Christmas photoshoot I had planned (along with multiple other options), but in the end I had decided on wearing a different outfit, so I will be returning this one. My fianc√© also had said he had preferred some of my other options over this one to wear.

I thought I could fix that, no problem, but then I could barely button it despite sizing up. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4, 125, C bust, petite and ordered a large to accommodate chest. It fell at the correct place for the waist seam and was slightly long but I was planning on wearing with leggings and boots. They are cute in pictures, but overall proportions were just off. I thought I had a mis-sewn one but the other one fit the same so it was disappointing to say the least. It fit in some places but not others. The arms were the worst, I‚Äôm toned and fit but my arms are slim. It made no sense for the upper arm to be so tight. I wound up cutting the sleeves off and repurposing it to be more like a sleeveless open front. It was a lot of work but it I tired to make it work because I like the print."

I‚Äôm highly disappointed considering I dislike wearing brown, and these colors are just awful.

So I am a petite belt woman, so the upper part of the dress from the shoulders to the chest are a little oversized for me even with a medium. However the rest of the dress fits pretty well. There is a slight gap with the buttons near my chest so I may need to add another button in between and or just wear it open with a tank underneath. I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and wear a 34D. But if I had bought a large it would look stupid big.  It is not the best quality dress I‚Äôve purchased, so I would probably compare this to Old Navy quality. When I first put the dress on the sides of the dress near my hips want to stick out way further than where my hips are, but once you add the tie belt it readjust it makes it look less severe. I would not size up on this dress unless you have unusually large arms or large chest. I would say this dress fits true to size. I will definitely be line drying this dress."

A lots of people were complaining with tide sleeves. XL size is giving me enough room for my arms. I am 5'10 tall dress is reaching up my tights enough to cover my bootie but I am having plan to wear under it- a short shorts. I am 127 pounds slim build with smaller chest not as is lady on the picture. My fit is good in this area where I can button up all the way  or just leave it open as is on the picture. I have no big complains for this item. For this price looks good made. Its cute little sporty dress for usual day. I contacted company with the question of the length of the dress in size XL but I didn't receive any answer. ( I gave it a shot and I am glad I did) I am glad the length of the dress ins't to my belly button:D As a Prime member I got the item in 2 days.

302,Ana B,5.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"October 8, 2020",It is a good flannel dress,"Ok this dress is good now... The cut of the dress is good, the finishing no soo good. The sleeves are just not a good fit and had no buttons or anything to make them look nice. The length of the dress was good for me because I am short so this dress fit at knee length for me. Most knee length dresses are too long for me. For reference I am 120 5'1"". The dress fit loose on my waist and just right on my chest, because I am a D, I did not go down at size, instead I use my sewing machine to take down the extra fabric by running a stitch in the back of the dress (it has a side zipper). In the chest I had enough room for my breast but the way that the buttons are set the dress still opens right in the middle of my boobs so I added a button (and button holes) in between each button hole the dress already had.Even with all these adjustments I still gave the dress a good review because the fabric is nice and soft, it is not a see through and I got many compliments on it. After all adjustments I do love the dress and the way it fits on me."

304,CountryGirl,5.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"February 2, 2020",I got a size medium. Fits good.,"I love this dress! I got a size medium. For me it worked great! It fits loose on the shoulders and the sleeves were too short so I just rolled them and I prefer half sleeves anyway. The waist is very loose but it has a belt of the same fabric that makes it look great and fit great. The chest is not made for big chested women. I'm a 34C chest and it was snug but it was a great fit I feel. The arm pits in this were ok for me but if my arms were bigger then it would have fit tight. There is not alot of give in the arm pit in this dress. I'm also 5 foot 5 inches and 135 pounds and I am skinny, a normal size 3 in jeans and I wear small shirts. This info may help. Anyone that is built like me it will be perfect! I got the size medium for this dress. The fabric I love! It's not a cheap fabric at all. It will hold. Just remember flannel is a different fit material and doesn't have alot of give in it and sizes do varry on each brand and it will shrink extremely, wash in cold water and air dry. I hope my review helps. I do recommend this flannel dress!"

I sized up thinking maybe this would shrink but it is much bigger than expected. Very much a straight fitting dress and a but darker than the picture (much more periwinkle not baby blue).I will say if straight dresses are good for you, this dress is incredibly comfortable. The sleeves don't have the bunching at the wrists like most sweatshirts and I was quite tempted to keep it just to sleep in because of how soft it was.Thick material and we'll made but I just couldn't get past the cut."

There's no shape to this dress at all and because the fabric is heavy, I don't think a belt or jacket would help. The dress would probably be great for lazy Saturdays around the house? I wear a 2 or 4 in dresses and have an average build. I ordered a small. It was tight through the shoulders and back but wide through the torso."
357,Mrs Whatsit,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"March 2, 2022",Unfortunately didn't work for me,"This soft, comfy dress would have been great if it hadn't been too big in the shoulders.  Based on reviews, I went up a size, and that mostly worked well.  The body fit just as I wanted it to:  just loose enough in the body not to cling, but close enough not to be shapeless. But the shoulder seams were about half an inch too wide for my shoulders on both sides and stood away from them, looking boxy and unbecoming. The strange thing is that I have fairly broad shoulders in relation to my hips, so this is unusual.  I looked at other buyers' pictures and saw that some people's dresses did, in fact, look too big in the shoulders -- but the seams didn't stand up in the same unflattering way that they did on me.  I don't think the rest of the dress would have fit properly if I had sized back down. So, sadly, I returned it."

Overall, it‚Äôs cute. Long on me, but I‚Äôm only 5 foot :) My one complaint on fit is that the forearms are weirdly super tight, like I can‚Äôt push them up at all.

It's not exactly flattering on its own-it really needs a jacket of some kind to add structure, but it's become my daily wear with the cooler weather. I gave four stars because 1. It has super tight sleeves that are difficult to pull up and stay up. 2. it stretches out when you sit down and then has a weird bubble where your butt was and 3. it doesn't have pockets. If it had pockets, I'd give it five stars even with the butt bubble and tight sleeves. I still kept it for the comfortable factor and it's long enough to be tasteful without shorts underneath."

I am not a heavy person in size but I was wanting to wear them at the beach as a cover up so i purchased the double X. I was surprised the whole dress is ‚Äúsweatshirt‚Äù material.  I thought from the description of the product the dresses were ‚Äúsweatshirt‚Äù look alikes. Regardless of how they were described when i put them on they are so very comfortable, you can move around in them, you can use them at the beach, to lounge in, sitting by a warm fireplace in the winter...the material is soft and plush and when washed they do not shrink, so i would suggest you purchase the size for you.  I only upgraded the size since its my intention to use the dress over other clothes...but you can wear them alone it would work just fine and probably what they were made for.  i highly recommend them. I purchased them during amazon prime days so I got a break on the price but they are worth purchasing in all colors."

The boxy dress fit a bit on the snug side for my taste, in the bust and in the arms. FYI, I don't normally have a problem with sleeves being tight in the arms.The dress is warm and comfortable. IF I purchase another one I would go a size up for me.I thought the description said it was French terry, but it is fleece on the inside. I have not laundered yet, so I hope it doesn't shrink.

The material does not feel as thick as the blue. Was tight even in the wrist ! I will be surprised if i can wear it after i wash it. Just not the same!  Frustrating!

Also, I tried to show from the pics that the medium is a tad big for me (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù 145lbs) but I‚Äôm pretty sure a small would be clingy in areas I don‚Äôt want. I‚Äôm going to wash & dry on high heat, so hopefully it‚Äôs a bit more form fitting, whilst keeping some of its forgiveness. ALSO, this item is truly a dress, not a long sweatshirt. I wish it were a bit shorter, but hoping after shrinking a bit I‚Äôll like the fit even more. Last, bc it‚Äôs super warm fleece, I think a half slip or slick leggings would make it the most flattering bc the material wouldn‚Äôt stick anywhere. Overall very well made!

I wear Sketchers boat shoes, a slip on with them.  I get so many compliments.  When I first put them on I thought the shoulders had awkward points sticking up.  No worries they are simply folding creases and come out in the wash.  If it is chilly  I wear thin leggings with them.  They are also a great value!  I have Heather Gray and Coral Stripe.  I hesitated to get the white stripe as afraid the white would be see through.  It wouldn't be as the fabric thickness is perfect.  These wash well, no problems."

The listing made it look very elegant, especially in black. However, when it arrived and I tried it on, the lining was about a foot and a half shorter than the lace top layer. Even the top layer is quite a bit shorter than indicated online. I'm 5'3'' so generally maxi skirts are a true maxi, even with heels. While it could work for some people, it significantly changes the aesthetics of the dress. I even went back and looked at the listing to see if I was misremembering what I bought. I understand that quality can vary on Amazon but I think the basic look shouldn't be that drastically different. Will be returning."

The positive side was it came with plenty of fabric at the bottom and negative side was that it's not lined properly it cuts you in the wrong spot making everybody look fat I'm sure.The stress had a hole in it it was not well constructed at all.

Part of that is because over the years, I've learned to compromise - since I'm just a little over five feet tall,  almost everything looks flowing and bohemian on me. (That's best case; worst case, I look like I'm wearing my grandmother's dress.)This dress, though, is just too large. I love the lace scallop at the hem, but I'd have to hem major inches off - losing that beautiful look (I don't even want to think about the cost of reproducing it). And the chest area, even though I went by the vendor's measurement chart, just hangs on me. But with no zipper, I'm not sure I could get a smaller size over my shoulders. If I were to try again, I also wouldn't order black - it's overwhelmingly funereal on me. Disappointing.The lace looks very attractive - up close, the edges are a little ragged, but the lace on the dress itself (apologies for the computer color changes) is very nice. If you've got more flexibility in your sizing, this would be a wonderful dress."

The dress isn‚Äôt flowing at the bottom like the picture advertises and that is the main reason I chose this dress.  Disappointed.

Only issues I had were the chest part was not lined which I did not know. It was see through in spots which came as a shock when I purchased. Also the dress fit a little bit so it hung in spots which wasn't a big deal, just made me look a little bigger than I truly am, but I didn't have time to return for a smaller size before our photos.

It is flattering, but much too bright than what was depicted in the product photo. I did appreciate the value for this dress."
459,Caitlin,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"October 9, 2022",Lots of cleavage,"Does not fully fit as expected. The busy area is too big so it gapes open. The rest is very flattering, very very thin though."

Great color and liked the material, although the front didn‚Äôt sit as low on the bust as I would have liked. unfortunately, after wearing this for just under two hours, the elastic at the waist popped and so the dress hung very loosely with no form on me for the rest of the evening. Big bummer. I don‚Äôt care enough to repair it, but if it had stayed in tact I probably would have worn it again, as I got a lot of compliments."
464,Corrin Mansfield,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"December 2, 2022",Make sure to have fashion tape,The dress looked great but the waistband is very tight and the top wouldn‚Äôt adjust enough to prevent slipping without using fashion tape.The tie for the top also didn‚Äôt want to stay tied so I ended up knotting it and then doing the bow and that worked well.Overall I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a decent dress as long as you know what to expect.

The top tie is slightly awkward for bigger chests, but I looped one side around my bra and then put the other through to create a knotted look and tied in the back. This felt like better coverage for me and I personally found it cuter."

I initially bought a medium, that‚Äôs my usual size‚Ä¶I have large breasts (36D) and the medium did not have nearly enough fabric to keep the wedding to at least PG 13. I sized up to large and was still experiencing difficulty with the tied part keep the girls in check‚Ä¶my boyfriend frequently had to tell me throughout the night to re-tie the dress because he could see my bra spilling out. However, if I went any larger, I would be swimming in the dress in other areas just to accommodate my breasts. I also have a short torso, so I found it difficult to style the dress similar to the pictures provided. Overall, I really liked it‚Ä¶just beware if you have a bigger chest."
470,Juana,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"August 10, 2022",Perfect for someone tall!,"I'm 5'5' and 150lbs, 36A, and this cute dress falls to my shins. The back elastic band sits a bit too low for my body proportion because if I were to pull it up to where I'd like, the fabric bunches up strangely. The fabric was beautiful and light and arrived in good condition. The zipper is stiff on the way down, but that would only be a problem if I were in a rush. The pink tone looked nice on my medium olive complexion. I'm wearing this for my mom's birthday party, so I wrapped the dress around my waist to cover the keyhole and tied it at the front for modesty. It also looks lovely with the keyhole and a front bow for those comfortable with more skin showing.  I can see this suiting someone over 5""5' and/or someone with a longer torso."
471,Amazon Customer,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"October 29, 2022",The tie is not as pictured,"The dress is overall super cute, decent quality. The tie in the front has a horizontal seam, meaning I could only tie it in the front to hide it."

473,Diana,5.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"November 13, 2022",Absolutely gorgeous color!,"Yall, the color of this is absolutely to die for. It's this gorgeous deep red with a bit of natural shimmer (not sparkly!) that makes the fabric look way more expensive than it is. I've included a few pics in different light to try to more accurately show the color. Run, don't walk--I'm gonna be wearing this SO many times this holiday season.Note: I'm a 34B and the front doesn't quite fit as intended, even though the rest fits perfectly--I have to tie it a few inches past the start of the tie seam. It's also a deeper v than expected, I'd say only about 2-3in to the top of the keyhole, so it sits at the base of my bra rather than in the middle. But I don't have any issue with that, because I found I can tie this several different ways to work with my body type. I've attached a few extra pics to show what it looks like if knotted in the front and wrapped to tie in the back, or with the waist tugged up an inch or so and just wrapped straight across to hide the keyhole entirely. I think it's flattering regardless and I love being able to wear it different ways!"

I am on the shorter side, at about 5‚Äô2 and about 190lbs with broad shoulders and hips. It was very flattering for my curves and baby bump! The top ties so you can adjust it as needed for the ladies. I was able to wear a nude bra underneath without too many worries of it showing. The fabric was a nice quality. It didn‚Äôt smell when it arrived, it was a little staticky, but that came out with a wash! It was easy to steam as well to remove the wrinkles from traveling. I will definitely be purchasing in another color for my baby shower!"

The dress matched the photos as advertised.I hoped that the nude would match my skin tone and feel more seamless than on the model. The nude is a warm beige--I have a lot of pink in my skin so it didn't match. The hemline was obvious through the thin lace layer (as shown in the pictures). It just felt a bit too casual for the event I needed it for.Overall a beautiful dress but not fancy enough for what I needed. Sadly had to return"

I also like that the nude underskirt is long enough that you can sit and move comfortably without worrying about accidentally flashing something for the world to see. As other reviewers mentioned, it might not be best fitting for you if you are shorter or have a larger chest. I am 5""8, 37-28-39, and size M was absolutely perfect, both in size and length. I think same size might also work for someone with a slightly(1-1.5"" range) larger measurements as well.

Although I did have to get it altered, the straps shortened (they're not adjustable) and the bottom hemmed (I'm very petite at 5'1"" 95lbs), the length of the slip underneath was perfect -- the alterations weren't a hassle, and totally worth it! I'd also like to note that you can wear a strapless bra underneath.**I only have one picture the upper part of me in the dress, but I've included some pictures of the front and back, some of the detailing and the slip length.

Mp,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"October 14, 2022","Really pretty dress, but colour is different than what I saw.","This is a very pretty dress, it is very feminine and flattering, and very comfortable. I am quite disappointed  though, because I saw that the colour, it was not as I saw it on the screen. I have bought many dresses at Amazon in the last 2 years, and this is the first one where the colour is different. On screen the colour I see is a seafoam, more on the green side. In reality, it is more like a teal or aqua and on the blue side..  It sucks because the colour was why I chose it, too, but I'll keep it.  Perhaps this was just my problem, but I caution people that the other colours may be different too...  Thank you!"
537,The Reen,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"October 30, 2022",Cute for multi-season dressing,Purchased my usual medium. Could have sized down but it works. Dress is super cute and a nice option for spring and fall. I belted it to give it a little shapr.The only thing I can't stand is the tie at the neck. It cheapens the whole dress. I will just deal with it for the price but it certainly gives it that amazon look and not elevated

I'm 5'4"" 160lbs and I got a large. I usually am between a medium and a large but I hate when clothes are too small. The fabric is soft and smooth. It is not a stretchy fabric.

It‚Äôs a little shorter but I am very tall. I also have a very big chest and the dress is made so you can not show as much or show as much as you want by the stitching. I have to send this color back but I have to order a new one in purple again because the wedding I am going to is next week and I can‚Äôt wait for the return. Overall though good dress.

There is a button to fasten in the back at the neck line. The eyelet is elastic and microscopic. How in the world can anyone button this from the back when it's on?  I ordered xl and these things go to the floor.  I have one more coming. I wish I had only ordered one. They are going back"

I ordered an XL because I was just a bit over the L bust measurement and I don't like being restricted. I actually do not think the large would have fit either bc there is NO give in the fabric. Also, the seam is at a weird point on the bust line. And I'm tall, but dang! This dress went clear down to my ankles! I thought it was a midi dress..."

It was a little too long (I am 5'2"" though so keep that in mind) and so it felt very Little House on the Prairie. But the bust had ZERO give. Unless you are the captain of the itty-bitty-titty committee, I would suggest to steer clear of this dress. I looked like I had two balloons strapped to my chest since it was spilling out on the top and the bottom, but flat In the middle... not a good look."

The dress is long and made of a comfy fabric which is great but oversized and not flattering. The print was too bold, not subtle as in the image. I bought the green at first then returned it because it had multicolored flowers in the print. I then bought the blue which had large white dots. I should have bought a solid color in a size down."

The shoulders were so out of sync that the seam attaching the sleeves was three inches below each of my shoulders. The dress has a high waist seam, and I've purchased this style in another brand with better material and better made. The material of this dress is a thin polyester and seemed cheap looking to me. However, it does not wrinkle, so I guess that's a plus."
598,Dennis Jennings ,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"October 17, 2022",Cute Dress But......,"I was so excited when I discovered this cute dress on line.  I am an older woman with kind of a  large  bust line.  I ordered the largest size available.  When I open the package I couldn't wait to wear the dress, that is, until I tried to tug it over my bust line.  It was just to dang tight to wear comfortably or in public.  So disappointing!  Time to include larger women in your clothing line-up."

God is good (Matthew 19:17). He sent Jesus to die for lost sinners that they might be saved (John 3:16). Sinners are finally saved when they (a) believe in Jesus as the Son of God (John 3:16); (b) repent of their sins (Acts 2:38); (c) confess their faith in Christ with their mouths (Romans 10:10); and (d) are baptized ""for the remission (removal) of their sins"" (Acts 2:38)."

612,JL,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"March 12, 2022",Great Beach Dress!,"I had been looking for a dress similar to this. I wanted to make one but it is hard to find fabrics that I like. I am not fond of V-neck dresses so when I saw these I thought this would be easier than trying to make one. In the end I have to say I really love these dresses! It is not a knit fabric, which for me is an advantage because the dress hides certain areas in my mid section!  I did find that I was a little bit in between the medium and the large, but I ended up buying the black polkadot in medium and the blue in large! I have also ordered the green one. So that says a lot about my opinion of these dresses. I really like the fabric, the tiers and the length.I am about 5‚Äò5‚Äú and the dress hits me a little lower than mid calf.  I was hoping to find three-quarter length sleeves so that if I do wear them to the beach or swimming pool my arms would be more protected from the sun. But everything else is so positive for me and I could make new longer sleeves if I want with a solid color fabric. I do think the price is a little high, I would expect this dress to cost more around $20-$22. One of the best things I have ever done is learn how to sew. If the large size turns out to be too big I can always take in the side seams. You can teach yourself to sew on YouTube once you have a sewing machine-there are a lot of used machines out there! It will open up a whole new world for you."

Both dresses looks like frumpy maxi on me, hits on my ankle no less. If you have heavy chest, that may give better shape. But not on me! However, I expected that from reading reviews. Decided not to return the dress because I love the dark blue flower print. The print and fabric doesn‚Äôt look cheap actually looks really nice and flowy. So I am going to cut it short below my knee and cinch the waist a little to give it shape. Why doing all these work? Because, it is hard to find a decent summer flowy dress with sleeve.

The only negative I would say was the seam at the waist, it's kind of noticeable.  So I had a shiny black belt from another dress, tried it, looked great so that's how I wore it.

Fabric smells and smells dirty, cheap and unfortunately like it came from a third world country.  I will have it professionally dry cleaned and see how it turns out.Second  mainly my fault, didnt pay too much attention to type of fabric  In the picture looks  sheer  smooth and more like a "" satin"" soft dress..  NOPE  It is more like a sweater potato sack material  Very odd.

To my surprise it fit well, and had a liner so it wasn‚Äôt see-through! (I am 5‚Äô4/ 125 with slim athletic build; I best fit in XS or size 2.). Frequently I buy things in the smallest size just to see if they can work without looking like a large sack. Unfortunately it wasn‚Äôt a true/ snow white, and off whites just don‚Äôt look great on me.  I figured I would get red and dark green.  Those came with a different manufacturer label, different (more lightweight) material, no liner as was on the white (not sure if since you can‚Äôt see through the color anyhow or manufacturer difference), and clearly were cut from different pattern sizes bc they had so much extra material I couldn‚Äôt make it look the way it was supposed to, and ALL 3 were different sizes of ‚Äúsmall‚Äù.  I‚Äôm going to try again with more colors to see if I get lucky and find one from the manufacturer that made the first one, and prob this fits most people great, but you might be making a trip to UPS for returns (or a tailor) if you‚Äôre on the smaller side"

I am 5' 1"" so mostly everything is too long for me but not a problem! I had it hemmed and it was perfect. I had my son 9 months ago and I'm a little self conscious about my tummy. The wrap around the waist made me feel comfortable and accentuated the slimmer part of my torso. The fabric was just thick enough to keep me warm in chilly bay area weather.

I contacted the seller about it, but they said Amazon shipped it so to contact Amazon. When I contacted Amazon, they were hardly helpful as well. They said that the return window closed so there would be a restocking fee to return the item. As if they could restock it. Also, when your dress falls apart, please make sure it is within the return window. I have worn this dress TWICE, for  a TOTAL of maybe 4 hours. One was for family pictures and the other for church. Nothing strenuous happed. The dress is simply sewn poorly.  I'm very disappointed with the quality of the dress and the customer support..Amazon is sending me a replacement and accepting the return, but I don't have much faith in the new one being better.

But when I tried it on, it was so tight and clung so much around the bust and especially the midsection that it was very unflattering. I ordered a Medium based on the size chart, but I should have sized up to Large.The material is quite a thin jersey knit, which makes the clinging worse. It‚Äôs not see-through, but it doesn‚Äôt have much drape, and won‚Äôt camouflage anything if it‚Äôs at all snug.Size up to avoid the unflattering midsection clinging."

It made me look like I had really fat upper arms due to the way the fabric was cut. If it was tighter by an inch or two, it would look much better. The shoulder hem line drops past the shoulders towards the arms (and I think it‚Äôs supposed to be that way), but the rest of the arm silhouette doesn‚Äôt become narrow until further down. It made me look like a weird balloon.3) The folded hem by the waist bulged out and made me look really frumpy, and it‚Äôs not because the sizing was off because the hip, waist, and chest area all fit.Good things about the dress:1) Very comfortable, cool, and lightweight fabric2) The tie part is flattering and I like how you can tie it in the front or back3) The dress has pockets!"
735,Brandi,2.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"November 17, 2021",Perfect if you are looking for a Wives costume for A Handmaids‚Äô Tale costume,"Ordered the Dark Green in a size up (XL) from my normal size (L, normally wear a 12-14) after looking at measurements. The dress that came was definitely not dark green but Teal in color, the fit was snug but not too tight as the garment does have some stretch (not much) but not as loose fitting as photos I‚Äôve seen. I definitely felt I would need to wear Spanx with this dress. The cut is not flattering at all. It is very conservative. I could not wear it off the shoulder as the neckline was not cut long enough and it don‚Äôt have enough give, it sat more like a long boatneck, and showed my bra straps. I felt like a character from Handmaids Tale. If I wanted to dress up like Serena Joy, this would be the perfect costume, but not my intent with this purchase at all. Definitely returning ASAP."

When it arrived I was very happy as it was simple but cute. I ordered my normal size (small) which I‚Äôm 4‚Äô8‚Äù and 115 lbs and it is just a tad big but wearable. Unfortunately after having only worn it twice I noticed the seams along the waist tie are already separating and there is now a decent sized hole. I did attempt to tie the waist differently to cover it until I can sew it up and wear it again, it‚Äôs just disappointing to have to think I have to do that after only 2 wears. Definitely could‚Äôve been better. I have dresses I‚Äôve owned for YEARS with not a single hole or issue unlike this one. If not for that I‚Äôd have definitely given this more stars as it is a very cute and comfortable dress."

I think I got a used one because it smells like bad food (maybe spaghetti?). Besides the gross smell, it has these 2 pleats on the back and it just stook out and looked really weird. The belt also falls closer to your hips than your natural waist line. The fit was weird and the pleats just don't work."

I've read lots of great things about this particular one, so I decided to give it a try.  I ordered it the grey green color, which doesn't quite match the pictures, it was much lighter in person.  I think if I had picked a different color (black, why didn't I order you) I wouldn't have hated the dress as much as I did.I am 5'7 and 125lbs for reference.The neck is like a boat crew, very wide so you might need to wear a strapless bra if you don't want to be constantly adjusting, not a huge deal for me.I ordered in a size small, and the dress was very unflattering on me.  I am on the thinner side so it wasn't quite 'body con' as described, which was disappointing.  The overall length of the dress was perfect, not too short, not too long.  The sleeves were a tiny bit short on me (this is something I am used to, but still frustrating).  I like the tie waist to give the dress a little bit of shape, but overall the size was too big for me.  Disappointed that a smaller size is not offered. Quality seemed good and this particular color was not sheer as some people have described other colors to be.Ultimately returned the dress as it was just not the right shape/size for me!"

I'm not taking a cheap dress to the dry cleaners every time. It goes through the wash just fine.On the plus side, I love the neckline, pockets, and versatile belt that can be tied in the front or the back. I bought a size small for reference.

The emerald color was beautiful. I was so pleased. Unfortunately, on the day of my event, I discovered a hole in the fabric on the back of the dress. I was so to send it back.

It's a nice fabric, and I would have tried a smaller size if it was available.  Ordered the small and it was too long overall and too long in the torso.  Hiking it up around the waist made the bottom half fit better, but there was too much loose fabric up top.  For reference, I'm 5' 5"" and a pear-ish 137 lbs."

It has stretch, accentuates waist. I got a small.  BUT the material is much to be desired. Its a cheap naterial, something similar you would get at a fast fashion store. The ribbing is not thick. I think this is a dupe for another dress at a more high end store of which I'll look for in the near future. For what I needed it for it will do but it will not be a dress i will probably wear again. If you want a classy chic look paying attention to the material is key. I didnt do that when I purchased this dress. As daid it does the job for for today"

I got it in the blue gray color and it looks pretty close to the picture. The material was thinner than I thought so I‚Äôd imagine lighter colors might not be as forgiving. I love that it has a snap so that there isn‚Äôt too much cleavage so I‚Äôm hanging out like most wrap style dresses, but it‚Äôs enough to still make it sexy.

However, I was pleasantly surprised when I put it on - it is super flattering, cinches the waist just right and falls around mid-calf for me. I got a medium and feel its perfect, could easily wear leggings, tights, shapewear underneath and feel comfortable. Can't wait to wear this with boots and pairs nicely with a cute jacket! Docked one star because I thought it would be a little bit thicker, or at least a solid material. I do not think it is see-through, but if pulled tight enough it could be. It has the ribbed material that is just that tiny bit sheer when stretched. Overall I would recommend and am considering getting this in another color!"
797,Maddie Ray,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"December 8, 2022",Size up,This dress was very flattering but I would suggest sizing up because it is slightly see through. I did the bend over/down test and you could see right through it

I usually wouldn‚Äôt order something form fitting but took a chance due to the waist detail and draping. I ordered a large in the burgundy color which was true to the pictures. The material is similar to a light jersey knit which I wasn‚Äôt expecting but it didn‚Äôt take away from the dress.For tighter Amazon clothing I always order a large. For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù, 140, short torso, carry my weight in my midsection, small B cup size but wide chest, minimal hips or backside, and have legs built like an old soccer player (bigger thighs and calves). I usually wear a 6 in old navy jeans or a 9 in juniors.It fit great without making me feel uncomfortable or self conscious once I had shapewear on. I‚Äôve had a lot of operations that have left a lot of lumps and bumps in my midsection and this dress concealed all of them. I did take off one star because the button/clasp at the chest was missing one side however I would have removed them anyway and used a safety pin."
804,Mfro,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"July 4, 2022",Great dress!,I got this dress for my sons wedding. It covered everything I wanted covered yet was not frumpy. I did get the small and it is a bit big but it did not make a difference. Lots of compliments.

806,Laura R.,5.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"October 20, 2022","Looks great on curves, give an hourglass shape","I love this dress! It‚Äôs the perfect style to be casual or dressed up. I really wanted a fall/ winter dress to wear with boots and this is perfect. It has long sleeves and the material is almost the look of a sweater but without the heavy weight. It‚Äôs a lightweight ribbed material that has a nice stretch to it. For reference I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù 118lbs measurements 32-26-38. I got the small and it fits really nice with a little bit of extra room in the bust on me.What I love is the style of this dress. The side draping looks great on curves and really accentuates and gives an hour glass shape. The draping also has a nice effect that hides the lower stomach area which when you‚Äôve had a baby is something I appreciate. The bottom has a asymmetrical hem which adds to the style and the length falls in between my ankles and knees, perfect for boots. I also really like that the neckline has a hides snap on the inside to keep the v neck from opening too wide. All in all I‚Äôm really happy with this dress, it looks great. I got the blue which is a medium shade of blue, sort of a French blue. And the dark khaki which is really a light brown/ taupe color."

I‚Äôm not sure how long the material will last because once it‚Äôs in a washing machine, it may develop lint balls. I hope not. I think I‚Äôll be buying a blue dress or burgundy dress. It fits nicely. It is a little longer than I wanted, but it‚Äôs cute. Instead of boots, I‚Äôll wear pumps with it."

The neckline is the perfect depth, and there‚Äôs a small clasp to give more cleavage if you want, length for me hits a little below mid shin, and the whole dress is fairly form fitting without being too tight. The knot and layering of the fabric makes this dress super flattering, and becuase of the fabric and detailing, you can‚Äôt see shape wear underneath. Fabric is nice and stretch, and perfect thickness, planning to wear for a late fall/early winter wedding!"

I was more than disappointed when I took it out of the packaging and tried it on. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just an issue with the ‚Äúpink‚Äù color, but it was VERY see-through, even wearing the sheerest underwear. The front was ok but once you turned around, everything was on display! I ordered a size small and medium to try both on for size. The small worked for me and was true to size, however, it was missing the belt it was supposed to come with! I‚Äôm not sure if the quality has gone down since this dress has become popular, but it definitely doesn‚Äôt look like how it does in most of the photos. Thin, wrinkly, and missing items."

The quality control for this dress is very poor and DO NOT buy if you are relying on it for a dress. Luckily I bought another dress and the event is weeks away or else I would be completely screwed. Yes, the dress is stretchy, but it also very thin material so it is not flattering at all angles depending on where you hold more fat."

I ordered a medium which fit pretty well but was a little snug around my backside and my chest. I didn't feel comfortable enough in the medium, I would've been pulling it down all night so I ordered the large. It was a little too big around the chest and waist, but it was more comfortable than the medium so I wore the large. I will say the shipping was fast which was appreciated, I got it just in time for the wedding. I was able to return the medium with no hassle so that was also a huge plus. I had so many compliments with the dress despite being a bit too big and I felt good in it. The material and stretch of the dress were comfortable. I wasn't pulling the top up or the bottom down all night. I had to wear a little bit of padding in the top as there is none in the dress. It is a cute little dress at a good price. I ordered the light blue dress and it was true to color. It comes in many other beautiful colors as well, it was a tough pick. However, my biggest complaint is that it doesn't have a clear strap on the strapless side to hang it up on a hanger! That would've been a great touch.

It‚Äôs about 2 inches above my knee. Definitely need to wear a bra with it, the entire dress is lightly lined. Can‚Äôt wait to wear it for a wedding"
853,Mindy,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"October 2, 2022",Great buy,"The reviews said to size down but I disagree. I got a medium and it was a little snug and short, I‚Äôm 5 foot 150 lbs. Fabric texture felt great."
854,Alyssa Graff,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"August 29, 2022",Almost worth the money,"I ordered a medium and while this dress is everything I could have asked for as far as fit and color, mine was shipped without the belt which I think would have made me love the dress even more. Missing the belt isn‚Äôt a total deal breaker for me as I‚Äôm still going to wear the dress, but for someone who really wants that belt to go with the dress shop cautiously."
855,Louis,5.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"December 2, 2022",Pleasantly Surprised,"I usually don‚Äôt write reviews, but wanted to since I depend on them so much.I have been looking everywhere for a dress for an event this weekend, online mall and local boutiques for a while. I ordered this on a last minute whim and will say I was pleasantly surprised.  I am 5‚Äô5 130 pounds with an A cup. The top for me ran big BUT with the adhesive bra it will help fill the gaps. Overall the dress fit well and was flattering. It came as a wrinkled mess but a steamer had it perfect in no time.I would recommend the dress, I purchased the black. I am not sure if the lighter colors would be sheer."
856,J73,5.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"December 5, 2022",Fitted; relatively true to size but size up if between,"I‚Äôm usually a small or medium. According to the chart, both would work- started with a small and it was wearable but a touch too snug. I returned for a medium and it was the winner.I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and have trouble finding dresses that are long enough. This one was perfect, it‚Äôs sexy but I never worried and didn‚Äôt have to yank it down too much all night. The sleeve length was a little short for me but I just pulled it up and did a quarter sleeve look. Long limb problems."
857,Lauren B,5.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"December 5, 2022",Buy it immediately,This dress is a steal and fits great. It was comfortable and easy to press.

858,Lauren Taylor,5.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"November 22, 2022",LOVE!,"Bought this for a fall semi formal wedding, and it fit like a glove. Very complimentary to curvy bodies, and the front part helps hide any belly that you don't want to show while still keeping it sexy. The only down side is that it snagged on my clutch and got a hole. But other then that, totally worth it!"

I cinched it up and threw a Jean jacket on and it looked good I thought. I also let the strings out like a pencil dress and layered it with a nice top and a belt on the waist and it passed for boss babe work wear. Have had many compliments so far. Added a jacket for more edgy-ness. All in all I really like this dress in all the different ways you can wear it and style it.
873,ADorn,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"September 12, 2022",Surprise it‚Äôs a cutie,"I like this dress. It‚Äôs cute and I guess in the picture it looks more like a tight fitted dress with rouching on the sides, when in reality it‚Äôs more like the entire side of the dress is drawstring so you can draw up and gather the whole side of the dress. Which is cool and gives you a couple of different ways where it. I like it! Again I think I got it a little bit too big but it‚Äôs definitely cute and I like the way it was styled in the picture so I‚Äôm definitely going to try to do that look too don‚Äôt tell anybody lol"

First thank God I ordered a size up just to ensure I had a little room. Amazon recommended a large since I've ordered many dresses now in a large and they fit perfect. I ordered this in XL in red and it fits almost like a medium. Well the red is not vibrant at all, kinda looks like I seriously could've picked this up at Ross stores, and it's super thin, see through material. I just tried it on and looked in the mirror and I can clearly see my  entire panties and outline! Next it's fits super tight in bust (I'm a  40C for reference) and waist area but kinda camoflauges the tummy a little if you're looking for that. I found the ""hidden"" zipper on the right side. It's not worth the price I paid for it, maybe should be marked down to no more than $25.00 and it's so freaking wrinkled it's ridiculous. Also the tie in the back is way longer than the one in the front which is super short, and I can't figure out how to tie it so it looks like the picture. I bought this specifically for an event this coming weekend, but now I'm like ""meh"", a bit disappointed in how it actually looks versus the model wearing it in which it looks all classy and upscale. At this point I may return it and try to find something else altogether, this dress was a huge letdown, huge!"

The material itself was very rough to the touch, sheer, and overall bad quality. Sometimes with clothes you buy online you genuinely get what you pay for and can‚Äôt complain, but this dress was so over priced for the product presented. I‚Äôve gotten better name brand dresses at Ross or Marshall‚Äôs for the same or even better prices. Overall, bad dress, poor quality, not flattering at all and definitely not worth the 40 something dollars spent."
892,Connie S,1.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"October 21, 2022",Highly disappointed,"I ordered this dress in black (xl) and the fit was so great and I looked awesome!

Item modified incorrectly for bigger sizes? Possibly. Definitely not the product that was purchased. Was not a wrap dress. The sleeves were okay. The 2inches of separation between the bust, waist line, and a random ruffle they added.

I'm a medium, company said I was medium, Amazon said I was a medium, I'm not a medium in this dress. It could barely be zipped up & I looked like a sausage. Also ordered a large and that's too small. I could keep the large if I wanted something too low cut and open on top (for me but some people like something that low cut and open) & that much exposed thigh (again that's me, some people like that look.). If this was for a hot date then maybe I would keep it. Maybe. It's not, it's for a wedding so both the large & medium are going back."

The L fits, but the 'wrap' and tie cinch up under the bust, closer to the armpit rather than the waist like the picture shows, and where the ties come together is not on the seam as the picture shows, making it look really ill-fitting.

Make sure you know item fits you well before buying, if not be aware of shipping charges. Ps: my previous review on this item was denied by Amazon saying that I have to review the product and not the seller. I hope this 2nd review will get approved because this is about how the item looks and also about the fact that the return policy displayed by Amazon is misleading. Thank you!Update 6/23/22:3rd party seller customer service was wonderful. They gave me 2 options and both were very reasonable. I just want everyone to know in advance that this dress is nice, maybe in a solid color and definitely not ivory floral which is creating the problem I mentioned. Fabric is good quality, not  thin. If it were not a crisscross design at the chest but same single fabric on both sides this might have worked for me, but with only one side one way and different on the other side it wasn't looking good.

Haven't decided if I'm keeping it because I ordered another dress that I liked slightly better for the occasion.  I would have to have this hemmed to my ideal length and also have the skirt tapered to a pencil skirt cut because it is a bit too loose in the way it is cut.  For reference, I ordered small, I am 4'9"" just had baby few months ago at 122lbs right now, have 8 lbs to lose, 29 waist (still have inches to lose), 38 hip, 32DDD.  Also, the way this dress gathers at the dress does help with a bit of tummy, but the tie at the waist adds unnecessary volume in that midsection and would prefer it without."

My waist is 28"", bust 32C, and I ordered a medium. It fit ok on the waist, but the chest was much too baggy. Also, I appreciate a puffy, billowy sleeve, but these paired with an unfitted top made the dress look like it was swallowing me. I decided not to reorder smaller though because I did not care for the dots, my husband and I agreed that they made the dress look more like it had a disease than it looked like Swiss dot. I also would have needed to wear a cami underneath it because the V-neck came down too low. On the plus side, the fabric has a nice, heavy drape, and I loved the blue color."

I realized that although it fit perfect everywhere else, it was a little snug around the chest. I always get a medium or large in things and the large was a little too snug. Will I be returning it it? Yes I will and for a larger size. This was a flattering dress for sure. But for bigger chested women please wear a bra as it does accentuate quite a bit. I am worried that washing it may shrink it too. It feels like 100% rayon.  I didn‚Äôt see any care instructions so I‚Äôm deducting one star. But I love all the variety of colors to choose from."
952,B. Peters,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"October 10, 2022",Nursing friendly!,"I ordered this dress in the lighter blue, green, and apricot colors. My daughter said the apricot one looked like a tablecloth on me (it looked so good on others online!) and the blue one looked like pajamas. The green looked pretty on me, but just a bit too fancy for just going to church. The functioning buttons were what really made me want it, in case I ever have another baby. I love wearing dresses, but you can't wear most dresses while breastfeeding your baby. I ended up returning it for a more casual green dress."

It‚Äôs fine tho and I‚Äôll continue to wear it. Also, I‚Äôm not large chested so it was a tad bit loose in the bust area."

958,D. M. Bean,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"September 18, 2022","Not perfect, but still pretty","When I ordered this dress there were only a couple of reviews and I really struggled as to what size to order.  I felt the size chart was a little contradictory considering the measurements given for the model.  I was concerned that a Medium would be too large in the bust, but I didn‚Äôt want the elastic to be too tight, so I ordered the Medium.  It‚Äôs possible I could have gone with a Small, but the Medium fits fine.  I have included photos of the Medium dress with a tape measure, so hopefully that will be of help to others on the fence.The length is good on me (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù) and it comes to my ankles without shoes on.  It looks good with sandals or boots.  Nice and flowy and feminine.I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the waistband.  It tends to bunch on me and I feel the need to keep tugging it down into place.  Also, the dots on my waistband go crooked, which cheapens the look a little.  I think it may look better with a belt.  I have included photos of it with a belt I had, although I don‚Äôt particularly like the color with the red dress.  I just wanted to give an idea of what it would look like with a belt.  Maybe I‚Äôll get a brown belt to go with it‚Ä¶The sleeves are very full.  The elastic at the wrists is loose on me, but it does allow me to push the sleeves up to ¬æ if I want without it being tight or uncomfortable.  The buttons on the front are real, working buttons, which makes it very easy to get on and off.  Hooray!  The fuzzy dots look a little raggedy where they ended up on the neckline, so I think I‚Äôll try to just trim those areas up a bit and it shouldn‚Äôt be noticeable.Overall, a nice, pretty dress.  Not my first pick in my closet, but I know I will enjoy wearing it."

I selected the size small in dark green. The fit of the dress was perfect. This dress has a nice weight to it, just the right amount of flow and room! The elastic waistband is very becoming and shows off the curves nicely! The v neck is of nice, modest design. Overall this dress appears very high end, like it came from a little downtown boutique. I feel very comfortable wearing it out on a date with my other half and to work/church. I paired this dress with nude sandal wedges for a perfect fall look! On top of all this style, this dress is soooooo comfortable. A great edition to your fall wardrobe! No complaints at all."

The chest, waist, and sleeve length are true to size, but if you are taller than probably 5'4"", this dress will be too short. The picture depicts this dress as full length - as in touching the floor - but in reality, it was at least 4 to 5 inches too short. I am 5'8"" and even with bad posture, this dress stopped just passed the middle of my shin. Also, the elastic around the upper waist was weird and uncomfortable. I liked the fabric, and the color was ok, but the shortness of the length made this dress extremely unflattering on me. I returned it immediately."

I wanted these dresses to use for costumes for Halloween, and even then, I had to reject them both. The material is weirdly uncomfortable and was so stretchy, it was almost clownish. Even though the dresses were too large for me as I admittedly ordered, the sleeves were tight at the seams, and at the same time were extraordinarily long. The elastic in the dresses which I assumed would be at about an empire position based on what I saw online, was in fact almost around my waist and I am not particularly short-waisted. Also, I am 5'6 and I had to lift the hem in order to walk, the dresses were so long. I have the dresses packed with the appropriate label, ready to return. What a waste of time and energy."

Maybe size down on this one.,"I love the dress, however,I ordered a small ; I'm 5' 6.5"" tall and max 110 lbs or less.  I ordered the Small rather than X-Small because I have long arms and legs so dresses are often too short in length and sleeve length.  The dress fit in the chest, and the sleeves are plenty long.  My problem is the top pulls down, first, I'm a 34AA so the dress is not stretched in the bust area.  I think the weight of the dress combined with my small bust size pulls the top down and feels awkward.What I don't like with the dress is how it arrived.  Wrinkles like you wouldn't believe, truly, looked like something in a bag of old clothes for a long time.  I don't want to wash the dress and hang it to dry since I will be returning for an X-Small.

999,K. Bourbeau,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"August 25, 2022",Not the most flattering waist line,"I am 5'8'', 165 lb, I usually wear a medium or a large. The large was recommended and was a decent fit, maybe a little big; the pockets stick out and make it a big frumpy looking. The waist line was not flattering. The dress was covered in white animal hair when I opened the plastic, which was bizarre and gross.  I like the material and length, will be nice for fall/winter in Southern California. Not going to keep it."
1000,C.Criswell,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"November 16, 2022",Long and comfortable,"I purchased this to get baptized in but decided to wear it afterwards. It's very comfortable and long and fits true to size with some stretch and I love that it has pockets. Eventhough the dress is white it stills covers you but the top part is a little thin and you may need to wear a jacket or appropriate under shirt or bra to have complete coverage. I wld also recommend wearing full underwear like shorts or those full body girdles to help smooth out your silhouette since white can be unforgiving. Honestly, the cost is a little too much for the top part of the dress cld have been a little thicker for better quality but it's still a nice comfortable dress to wear around the house."
1001,Macromama,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"November 24, 2022",Dress or nightgown?,"It feels like a nightgown - the fabric (nice royal blue) is very soft and comfy like a nightgown - lighter softer feeling fabric than a t-shirt. It definitely needs a belt - looks too much like a nightgown without one. VERY long - will have to hem it 2 1/2 inches so I can wear it with 2 inch heels!  (I'm 5'4"", 140 lbs & generally get a size 12 top because I like things loose. I got a size L and it couldn't be any smaller or it wouldn't fit. Like most things today, it's overpriced for it's simplicity."
1002,K8,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"October 16, 2022",Great dress for postpartum‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôm 4 months postpartum and still have a slight pooch going on, so I‚Äôve been hating how all my pre-pregnancy clothes fit. This dress fits great and looks great! I got the XS. (5‚Äô3‚Äù, 130lbs). I went with the XS, because I wanted it more fitted in the sleeves, and was worried about the length‚Ä¶ I hate when skirts drag on the floor, and this was just right (a little below my ankles). The shape is fitted around the bust area (34B chest) and then drapes over the pooch area, which is perfect!The only reason I took off a star is because of the price. The fabric and quality of the dress is clearly cheap, and I‚Äôd expect to pay around $20 for it somewhere like Wet Seal. And on that note, I prefer to put a chunky cardigan on, use a belt or long necklace to distract from the cheap look.Overall I do love it though, and unless it falls apart after a couple washes, I‚Äôll say it was mostly worth it."
1003,Samantha Garland,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"December 8, 2022",Not Really Red,"The dress fit well, I have actually ordered several.  My only real complaint is that the color in the photo doesn't match the color I got.  In the photo, the dress seats to be a nice rich red color; however, in person, the dress is lighter and more of an orange red."
1004,Kumari,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"October 3, 2022",I like it,"I don't LOVE it, but I certainly like it. The pattern does a lot to hide my post menopausal paunch, as does the empire waist. It's a forgiving dress in a soft fabric. I like that it is long sleeved and has pockets. More dresses should have pockets. I'm 5'4"" and it is awfully long. That's ok for me because I plan on wearing it to a wedding with heels, but if you are my height or shorter you may want to get it hemmed.What's not so great about it: the dress maker doesn't try at all to match up the fabric pattern with the seams which belies the inexpensive nature of the dress. But for that matter it's not really that inexpensive, I would have forgiven this on a dress of $25 or less, but $35 and above is the cost of this dress - - they could have been more consistent with the quality. Some of the dresses were longer than others even when supposedly the same size."

I also direct choirs, and I think I will wear this when I conduct. It's so simple it won't distract from my students. I long necklace or a scarf would make it look fancier. The price was right."

After reading the reviews, I bought the red paisley to give it a try. Love it! The first day I wore it out shopping and to dinner, I got multiple complements from complete strangers. It is very comfortable! I ordered the navy to wear to a funeral. Once again‚Ä¶ loads of compliments. I wore both dresses with ankle boots. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and weigh about 118 lbs. The small fit great. The length was just right for me in flats. But the boots looks good as well.I have since ordered the wine red planning to wear it during the holidays with a Christmas scarf. One thing I love about this dress is how easily you can dress it up with accessories or dress it down for casual. A few reviewer‚Äôs mentioned a smell but there was no bad smell with this material. I steamed a few of the wrinkles out and it looked great. I haven‚Äôt washed them yet.  Will update my review after I wash it."

If you want to look nice, go to a birthday party, go to the farmers market, or just be home and want to look pretty while being comfortable, don't hesitate to get this dress. I never leave reviews unless I REALLY love something or had an awful experience. You won't be let down with this dress.SPECS: I'm 5'5"", 140 lbs, 36B chest, and the medium fits PERFECTLY. I have thin arms, and I admit these sleeves are just big enough. If you have my body measurements, but thick arms, this might be a squeeze.It is a soft, stretchy material (yes, similar to pjyamas) so there is give. It is fairly high wasted, I have a high waist and the line on this dress is about 2 inches higher than my waist. It doesn't bother me though b/c the rest of the dress is perfect. I'm going to wear a thick belt with it that dresses it up and features my waist where it is.I can't wait to order another one right now, but a different color. I might try the large just to see if the waist is a bit lower, and the arms a little looser. I'm only afraid if this shrinks it might be too small.I plan to only hand wash this dress though."

Not only is that a beautiful, radiant pattern that my husband liked, but pairs well w/boots & jacket to go out.  Very midwestern look (according to my friend).  Has pockets and quite a bit of comfortable stretch.  I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô2 1/2 and the dress goes all the way to the floor but doesn‚Äôt drag.  I‚Äôll be purchasing a few more.

Second dress was not the same material, not lined or fuzzy inside, but still nice material.  It also fit a tad looser in hips so that was great.  Not so clingy.  Got many compliments on this dress.

I had to pull the dress down a lot to keep it from riding up in the lower back area, and the shape of the dress is flattering if you can keep it in place better than I did. I do like the matching buttons, and they are all held in place by elastic bands, but if you push up your sleeves out of habit like I do, then there might be a decent sized gap above the cuff, and it also felt a little out of the norm since the elastic around the button gets stretched. The back isn't particularly my favorite due to the elastic waist band showing along with the bunching of material right below the elastic. Also, if you sweat just from thinking about sweat like me, then I recommend a different dress since this material showed sweat under my arms not even 30 mins after wearing. I couldn't give this dress 3 stars because I think it would fit other body shapes and those who don't sweat or aren‚Äôt bothered by it much better. Thanks and hope this helps!"

1071,Jimena,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"July 25, 2022",Good quality and price,"I think the quality of the material is really nice, soft and has a little stretch. For $30 this feels more expensive. I tried the sage green dress and it was flattering, covers the belly area and is modest at the top. However it is does accent the booty so if you like that you‚Äôll love this. Not my style but that person preference. Def worth the money and it is really pretty."

The fabric is nice,  It looks like silk and feels like it as well.  The hip wrap feature is a great aspect of this dress.  I have a beautiful silver brooch that I put on the knot and it really makes it pop.  There are so many ways to restyle this with different accessories.

The length fell right around the knee/almost below. It was just an awkward length on me. The top of the arms/armpit/chest area felt tight and it made my boobs look like fat pancakes conveniently placed under a tight dress.

The fabric was slick but I have no complaints about that. As a small chested lady I highly suggest ordering a size to 2 sizes smaller than your normal size. The dress has a lot of room in it and can hang to long if you don't size down. Other than that it is a nice dress.

I was a little backlit when I tried it on and noticed that you could kind of see the line of my legs through the fabric. But I think it would be impossible to wear any kind of slip with this dress.

Paid $50 for the slip to only reach my knees and the bottom part of the dress is completely see through. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5, the dress is 3 inches short in the back and the front is so long I keep tripping over it. Not comfortable fabric. Looks nothing like the pictures. I ordered in 3 colors and 2 sizes, L and XL. The L was too small and the XL was too big. The seams in the front of the dress are an unflattering upward V shape and makes your hips look 10 times larger. This dress is SO cheap and overpriced. I had to sew my own slip and bring in the waist on the XL. For having to basically remake the dress I really want my money back. I didn‚Äôt have time to shop for more dresses for a wedding coming up or I would have sent all 3 back instead of just the 2. This dress is my biggest regret of the year‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm a broke college student. I wish I could give 0 stars 100 times over.

It has a very low cut neckline that was saggy on me. The fabric has no stretch.

However, I needed this dress for a wedding. This dress is long and not see through. I did not need to wear a slip. It was flattering to my tall frame and the deep V neck saves it from looking like an 1880s prairie dress. You can pin the neckline up if that is more comfortable for you. I got the blue one with the iris print. Recommended for tall women who need a floral dress but do not want to look like they could walk onto the set of Little House on the Prairie."

I‚Äòm also a 40DD. I got The XL in hopes it would fit and not need to much effort getting it on or being to clingy since I feel gross with my weight issues at the moment. While yes there is some cleavage I can‚Äôt get rid of lol the dress fit WONDERFULLY!!! Very flattering. Has a slip below my knee. Just hits the floor a bit but not dragging. The colors are far more vibrant in person. I was hesitant because of the price but I am soooo happy! I love this!!!Update: wore this to a wedding. Had so many compliments. It was so comfy and forgiving! It was an outside wedding and I wore my rhinestone Betsey Johnson ‚Äúcombat boots‚Äù with it. Literally have never been so comfy and felt so pretty!

I appreciated the snap at the neckline that makes it so cleavage doesn‚Äôt get out of control. It has this ‚Äúretro‚Äù feel.Unfortunately it just didn‚Äôt feel right on me and both my husband and mom agreed. My husband- who always things everything looks amazing on me- felt it make me look older (and I‚Äôm 41 so that‚Äôs not a compliment anymore) and my mom said it just wasn‚Äôt flattering for my body type. My mom and I both agreed that someone curvier with and hourglass figure would rock this dress-though I would highly recommend smoothing undergarment ‚Äòcause it hugs everything in the back.It‚Äôs a dress that is worth giving a try but order a backup just in case.

It fits big through the upper body, although I don‚Äôt think a small is the solution for me because the skirt slip is very short, and it rides right up when I walk."

The only exception is the bust area is really baggy. I am a 34D and the fabric just hung in a strange manner. Basically if I pulled it up, folded it and sewed it at the shoulder area to make it tighter in the bust, it would be perfect. I could‚Äôve gotten away with wearing it with it being baggy.

This dress has been a favorite to many as it looks as if they're about to have a lovely night out. While the dress is symmetrical upper half the bottom half gives off a very sophisticated look. Very classy and not too revealing. Seams are on point, no loose threads that I've noticed. No sign of mass machined production. Beautiful dress."

Admittedly, I can‚Äôt complain about the color or the fit (since I'm not a small person and it is sometimes hard to find clothing that fits correctly), but it could use a tiny bit of help. The sleeves would be better as quarter sleeves (rather than full arm length) and the skirt (behind the rouching feature) either needs to be longer, or the slit needs to be affixed to the skirt so it doesn‚Äôt come open when you‚Äôre walking. I‚Äôd also like to see either one piece of fabric for the dress, or some kind of belt to cover the elastic midsection where the top and the skirt are sewn together. Otherwise, I don‚Äôt hate this."

I am traditionally a medium and that‚Äôs what I ordered. It was very large on me and at waist the elastic did not hold against my body which made it look sloppy. I think sizing down may have helped but also I would worry about how short it was when sizing down. I think this would fit a shorter person better for length and overall size down for a better fit around the waist. I did love the color of the dress and wish it fit better!

I got the red with the gold polka dots, I think it‚Äôs perfect for the winter holiday season/Chinese New Year. The length is great, sits just above the knees. The sleeves have an elastic on the end so it‚Äôs never too long on anyone. The fabric is not prone to wrinkles which is great. Easy care, just toss in the washer in cold water and air dry. I recommend washing it inside a laundry bag. At $37, I think it‚Äôs a decent value."

I am not one to buy clothing off of Amazon ‚Äì or almost anywhere online really as I like things that fit and decent quality as well.  I was pleasantly surprised by this ‚Äì as again it is pretty gorgeous in person and seems to be made pretty decently.I ordered the XL as I am a 6-foot-tall woman and I was afraid it would be VERY short and I might have to wear shorts or something.  And yes, it is short (babydolls are supposed to be), but surprisingly it was not micro on me.  I could totally wear this out and not feel my butt was exposed.  (Although I would probably wear a pair of yoga shorts just in case ‚Äì but that is me.)The issue I have is that the lining is not too flowy on me and tends to ride up a bit ‚Äì so maybe my butt is sort of being exposed a bit. Ha ha ha. Eventually anyway.  : )  Also, I have a naturally large chest and I will say putting this on over my head (and getting it back off) was a bit of a challenge with my bust.  It is snug there ‚Äì on me anyway ‚Äì especially with the waistline getting it over my bust.The outside material really does flow and flounce pretty well ‚Äì but it is not hanging off of me all swingy like the models in the listing ‚Äì as true babydols are supposed to.  But again ‚Äì I am not teeny.  It does have a bit of flow and definite flounce to it, though.  Personally ‚Äì especially with the bust ‚Äì I would have preferred to go up a size for a much looser and freer true babydoll look.  But again ‚Äì it does look so pretty on me.  Especially after I paired it with some beautiful blue heels I just got.  Way more than casual looking paired with the right shoes and bag.I hope that you have found my review ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù. : )  Enjoy your day! : )"

I ordered this dress because someone on Instagram said it was fleeced lined and it also said it was fleece lined in the reviews. Clearly this design has been changed. It is a very cheap material and I did not feel confident in it at the wedding. You can see in the picture I attached that the dress was too big. I will not be buying from this company again.

1305,Jojo,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"October 5, 2022",Run small,This dress runs very small I ordered an extra large along with a few other dresses and this one was one of the tightest fits I could have probably gone up a size or two if there was an option. I usually love formfitting dresses even for my size but this one was uncomfortably tight.
1306,LOLITA BANDONG,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"November 2, 2022",Poor Quality,"The quality of the material is poor. Also, it was so unflattering to me."
1307,Vicky,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"November 10, 2022",Material is different depending on color,I ordered this dress in red originally in September for a party. I loved the fit and material was thick and flattering. I decided I'd exchange it for a dark green color instead and wear it for Christmas family photos this month. The green dress I received is a not the same quality as the original. The green dress is made of a much thinner material and has an overall cheaper appearance. I'm disappointed because I loved the first dress and would've kept it if I knew I wasn't going to receive the same quality in green.

1310,Amanda,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"September 20, 2022","Great fit, pretty color but fleece lined",I didn't realize this dress was fleece lined. Way too warm to be functional for an event with dancing and moving around

It was too tight in the arms and the shoulder stitching didn‚Äôt lay where it was supposed to."
1313,Andrea Alvarez,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"December 4, 2022",Runs big,"I really liked this dress, I wish it would have fit. It‚Äôs super flattering in that it hides the belly. However, it was just too big for me. I ordered a medium which is what I‚Äôve been wearing these days, I‚Äôm a size 4 which the sizing chart does say is a small but my measurements per the sizing chart say I‚Äôm a medium,  but this was just a bit loose on me. Also the arm sleeve was extremely baggy, looked weird. I think that‚Äôs why the model has the sleeve scrunched up to her elbow. That‚Äôs the only way to make it look right. I loved the color and the material wasn‚Äôt bad. It was like a thick spandex. My dress did not have any kind of lining which other reviewers have mentioned. Maybe if I would have ordered the small the dress would have looked better on me? Unfortunately I will have to return and wear something else to the wedding, I ran out of time to get the smaller size."
1314,Erin,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"November 20, 2022",Thin but good fit,Wore this to a wedding last night and it did look good and did the job! There was only a couple of things I would work on with this dress and that was 1. Material was a bit thin‚Ä¶ not see through at all but just thin‚Ä¶ glad I wore bike shorts underneath or every extra curve or blemish would have shown. It worked out fine with the shorts though so not upset at that! 2. It would gape slightly in the front and ride up if walking or dancing even for a short period of time‚Ä¶ I had to keep pulling the bottom part down or re-tying the wrap area. Overall not upset at this purchase and it did the job and did look great I just wasn‚Äôt 100% comfortable the whole night.
1315,Amazon Customer,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"December 3, 2022",Very flattering!,I love this dress! I bought it for my son's wedding this past November.  It fit great and was so comfortable to wear all night long. It was perfect for our bipolar south carolina weather.  Not too hot yet it kept me fairly warm throughout the night.  Only thing I wish was that the tie wrap would stay put better. It loosened up a lot throughout the night but the type of fabric it is I figured it would do that anyways.  Still loved the dress!
1316,Marie Nicole,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"November 30, 2022",Lovely dress,"I thought this dress was absolutely lovely. The material was not exactly what I was expecting, but it wasn‚Äôt bad. I would have appreciated a bit more stretch to the fabric but not due to it being too small. In fact, it was a bit larger than I expected. The wrap part gives plenty of forgiveness in terms of fit, so you‚Äôre probably safe ordering your size."
1317,Rebekka Croft,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"September 20, 2022",Cute and formfitting!,"I ordered this dress for a wedding. The color was a little darker than expected , but was super flattering. Form fitting and the tie covered up any belly you want to hide. I'm 5'2 and the dress fit me great, but was a little longer than I was hoping. The dress also has a fleece lining on the inside that was SUPER soft, but I'm thinking would be too warm for dancing at an indoor wedding. I did return it, but if I were a couple inches taller I would have loved it."
1318,olivia,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"October 9, 2022",Cute but not sure about the material,"This was super cute, but it was the material that threw me off. Very thick and clingy cotton"

Very elegant dress for a good price. I'm 5'3 and it is a great length on me.Please note, I would wear this during the colder months since the inside fabric is fleece. If you wear this for an outdoor wedding you are going to melt (LOL)."
1320,Natalie,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"October 26, 2022",Not for pregnancy,"I ordered this dress hoping to wear it to a wedding (I‚Äôm 7 months pregnant) however the dress was not very flattering in the mid section. The one sleeve was elegant & the length was perfect, the dress does have a little stretch to it but overall the fit did not work for me."
1321,AMM,5.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"December 4, 2022",Buy this dress!,"For reference: 5‚Äô0‚Äù 150lbs 40B bust (typically 10-12 pants)- ordered Medium;Fits like a glove! Covers my PP belly, that I am self conscious about, so if you feel uncomfortable about your midsection, this dress is *chefs kiss* amazing. I bought this for an upcoming NYE wedding, so I‚Äôm not sure how it will stand up to dancing and lots of movement but I suspect it will be just fine. The fabric is thin enough where you won‚Äôt sweat to death but thick enough where it‚Äôs not see-through. Being a shorty I was a little nervous about the asymmetric side being too long but it doesn‚Äôt even come close to touching the ground and with heels on it will look even better. If your in between sizes I think sizing down is your best bet. According to the chart I ‚Äúshould have‚Äù ordered a large based off of all my measurements (I ordered both and the large was just a liiiittle too large). Again, love it. Would highly recommend."
1322,Luke Fortner,5.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"December 4, 2022",Be careful what you wear underneath but beautiful!,"This dress is very figure flattering but picks up on any lines from under garments underneath! I went commando and should have worn nipple tape but instead wore a strapless bra and a line could be seen. Other than that the dress is beautiful! It‚Äôs is stretchy and not sheer. The style is great! I will be wearing for plenty more things, just being mindful of what I wear underneath!"
1323,Tina,5.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"December 7, 2022",Flattering and soft inside,Looooved the blue one I got. I got it for a wedding and maybe I didn‚Äôt read this part but the inside of the dress is lined with a fleece like soft material which added so much warmth that was needed. Loved how it fit. Ran exactly how you‚Äôd measure yourself.
1324,Melanie Sangil,5.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"November 24, 2022","Sexy, fun, and elegant!","This dress was super thin in the Dusty Rose color, compared to the thick material that the light pink had. I tried both colors and the Dusty Rose was more of what I was looking for to coordinate with my family for a wedding. The front of the dress is asymmetrical and hangs uneven, but it was fine for me. Just be sure to wear spanx since this material is so thin!"
1325,RO,5.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"November 21, 2022",Buy it!,I bought this last minute for a wedding. I am usually between a size 8-10 US and ordered a large. When it arrived it was a little loose so I threw it in the wash and dryer. It shrunk just enough to fit me perfectly for the wedding. It needed a little ironing on the ends but was so comfortable. Will definitely buy in a different color again.

The navy color looks like an off black and has brown buttons. It doesn‚Äôt match the buttons and looks like a uniform. If you get this dress, imagine it with brown buttons when choosing your color.

It was a little tighter in the bust than I was expecting based on the measurements provided. I ended up finding a different dress for the wedding I‚Äôm attending but I‚Äôm bookmarking the larger size just in case for the future. Material was nice and on par with the price point.

1349,Tboz,5.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"December 4, 2022",This dress is awesome,"This dress is so flattering and comfortable! Got in XL in black so buttons wouldn‚Äôt be pulling around breast area and it fits excellent. You can button it up or unbutton for a sexier option giving you options to wear professionally or for a night out on the town with the girls! The fabric is soft, easy to iron on medium heat. Sleeve length is long and I like that because usually things are too short on me. The silk material is silky on the outside and the interior is lined with a soft polyester/cotton soft stretchy material.  The wide belt is versatile you can tie it to the back or front for it to frame your waist. The gathered front is sexy and forgiving to the tummy area. I love it and will be ordering more colors!"

I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù and weigh about 130-135 and this was slightly larger than I‚Äôd like, but was still gorgeous on. I may have it tailored a wee bit but overall the flimsy oversized look is flattering.

My measurements are 36/32/39.)I received the large, put it on, and found it to be flattering in its style, but definitely way too loose, especially in the midsection - my ‚Äúproblem area.‚ÄùLuckily I used Amazon Prime ‚ÄúTry Before You Buy,‚Äù so I was able to return it and order a medium. It arrived the very next day and‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a perfect fit! The material is surprisingly thick, not see through at all, and the overall fit is super flattering.

It came right on time and the quality is absolutely amazing. The fabric is nice and stretchy, so the dress is very comfortable and you're able to move and sit without feeling constricted. It's also thicker so you don't have to worry about it being see through and it doesn't show your unwanted lines or bumps. There is a side zipper to help get into the dress easier, but because it's so stretchy it comes on and off easily. The length of the dress is also perfect if you're on the shorter side like me! I'm 4'11 and with a small heel the dress just touches my toes!"

The zipper is made out of plastic and has no hook at the top to keep the garment together. As a result, the dress is liable to separate with very little force.I wore this dress to a cocktail party and the zipper tore apart when I went to the bathroom.  I was essentially naked at the party and luckily my husband and I were able to find a stapler and literally had to staple the dress back together. It was absolutely mortifying.Unless you plan to do no bending or moving or dancing, I would -13355/10 recommend this dress. Can‚Äôt even return it because I literally had to staple it together."

No tag anywhere on the dress. It had been worn and returned and resold! I refunded it and ordered another one. This one arrives with the tag BUT had dog hair all over it! The tag on this dress can easily be tucked in and hidden which means people can wear it and easily return it and guess what..YOU may end up with it! I now have no dress to wear after purchasing 2 dresses! We are still in a pandemic people!!! Stop being nasty. Don‚Äôt wear things and ship them back to end up in other homes! That‚Äôs disgusting and tacky! Don‚Äôt waste your time ordering this dress. You may get the one with dog hair or the one in heavy perfume and body soil!

Got to the hotel and opened this up. No waist sash. Would've fit a thousand percent better with it. I had no choice but to wear it. It was all bagged up where it could've been properly cinched with the waist sash. Such a bummer."

Fabric was more like a midgrade bed sheet than a satin.  VERY thin material.  Zippered side did not have a clasp to hold the top together so when zipping I had to be careful not to pinch my skin.  My ribcage measures 33"" and the medium just barely fit.  Dress didnt have the ""beltloop strings"" to hold the belt up (my hips did fine, but if you dont have much there it might fall)Personally, I returned this item.  It just wasn't for me and for the amount of money that was I could definitely get a higher quality item elsewhere.  If you're not balling on a budget, I would suggest a different dress."
1415,Nich≈ële Tucker,2.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"August 31, 2022",Unflattering,The dress fit me but it was weirdly loose in random places. Tight on my shoulder and breast but the space in-between was like I could stick my whole hand through. I'm not sure if it's because I'm very busty or the material is too stretchy. It made me look really weird because of this so I returned it.

Purchased a medium after reading reviews. Was able to zipper dress up, but dress was still small.Purchased the beautiful blue color, the color was just as the picture and it comes with a belt. Top part of dress: The dress does have a slight scrunch elastic band under the arm of one shoulder which was super nice so arm doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs being choked, super comfortable and unexpected feature, but the dress was just super paper thin; just another silk slip so there‚Äôs no support. Zipper did zip from the side as well. Bottom half of dress: The bottom is meant for toothpick thin girls. It is Not whatsoever flattering for ladies with hips. The V bottom that is shown in picture does Not lay to the side, it sits straight in front, and since hips stretch it out, your hoohah will be shown to the world. The V bottom dress will open, even when you‚Äôre just standing still. The material feels nice against the skin though, but this did Not work for me, and returned."
1420,Leah,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"November 19, 2022",Chafes where the zipper is,The dress fits okay but it‚Äôs chaffing where the zipper is. There is little to no stretch and I am a true medium but it hugs me more than I‚Äôd like. The material is like a soft satin but the chaffing is terrible where the zipper is. I have been wearing it for about 2 hours now and it‚Äôs pretty bad. I‚Äôm not one to chafe either.
1421,Rylea,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"November 19, 2022",It‚Äôs fine,I bought this for a wedding guest dress. The top has a little more material that hangs off that isn‚Äôt needed.

Also, I ordered a XL and it fit everywhere else except that it was too loose under my arm where the zipper is and I didn‚Äôt want to have to keep pulling it up all night."
1426,Shanna B.,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"August 1, 2022",Good unless wet,"Loved the fit of the dress. Bought it to wear to a summer wedding. Before I left I noticed a small black spot on the back so tried to wash it out with warm water. The water created a ring outline that wouldn‚Äôt go away. Also noticed some spots/outlines where I had leaned against a wet counter. (Yes, I gave them time to dry.) It had also started to show sweat stains before I left the house. I‚Äôm not an overly sweaty person, so just decided to skip this one and go with my alt. Maybe not the best fabric for a hot Texas summer event. Hoping I can get it dry cleaned and have it ready for Fall."

It is saggy for me since I have a smaller chest size B on the top part. The strap that goes across your body to the shoulder is to tightly close to my neck. Not comfortable. I got the smallest size.
1428,Kayla,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"October 7, 2022",It‚Äôs ok,The zipper sticks but still works so that not a deal breaker for me.

I‚Äôm a 40DD had to return it and get the extra large dress. It fit perfectly a little big around the waist but there‚Äôs enough room to enjoy that extra dessert.  The fabric is really nice. It‚Äôs not cheap for the price.  The only drawback is the belt. There are no loops to fit the belt so once you tied the belt it would slip down I had to take it in to get it altered but it‚Äôs gonna be worth it because it is a really pretty dress.I purchased the deep red. It‚Äôs a beautiful color and will be perfect for my Christmas party."

It‚Äôs not terrific quality but for the price it‚Äôs lovely and assuming I hand wash it I expect to get several wears from this dress.The deep, teal blue color is lovely, I ordered the small. It fit well but An extra small would have been perfect. Like others have stated, the belt tends to slide off since there aren‚Äôt any loops to hold it in place. It‚Äôs still lovely though & I love the open shoulder style.I never buy clothing from Amazon and I‚Äôm happy with this purchase."

The photos make it look like it is a longer dress and it is not. It is definitely more of a knee length dress. I love the dress though, so I‚Äôm actually planning on purchasing another one and having it altered so it is longer. I think it‚Äôll be beautiful. Although it is not an expensive fabric, it actually is very elegant looking and with a couple tweaks it will be very pretty."

The XL fit better, but the neckline was too chunky and the ruching did not lie well. I also thought it was weird that the dresses were shipped in different bags with different logos.The nice thing about the dress is the elastic around the bust on the strapless side. It doesn‚Äôt cut in and hides your bra."
1436,Mdor,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"September 12, 2022",Beautiful Guest-of-Wedding Dress,"I loved this dress so much as a guest of a wedding. The green color is rich and the shape of the dress is very flattering and feminine. The one underarm of the dress is stretchy so it's comfortable, but there is no ribbon to hang the dress properly. The dress also ironed very well and did not wrinkle while it was worn. I also liked the sash as an added accessory, but there are no loops for the sash, so it fell off a bunch of times until I just put it in my purse. It still looks good without it, but I would have liked it better if the sash could have been better secured. Overall, highly recommend."

Maybe if you are slimmer than me then it would look phenomenal.  I thought that perhaps if I had gotten it in another color it would look nice but I think it‚Äôs my body type.Sadly I will be returning it.

All good. The other tiny inconvenience is that there wasn't a hook/eye clasp at the top of the side zipper. It would have been a lot easier to zipper up by myself if that was included, but, eh it was a $30 dress... What are you going to do?I did, however, have a problem in how my package was delivered. It arrived in the 'zip-lock' style bag. Normally when I order from Amazon, the clothing bag (with zipper top) is secured in a packaging bag of some sort, this was not the case with this package. It was just the flimsy clothing bag with a shipping label slapped on it which wouldn't have been so bad I suppose if they had secured the zipper portion of the bag. So basically, anyone could have opened the bag, taken out the dress (for whatever reason) or it could have opened and fallen out completely leaving me with a delivered empty bag. Listen, this might not be a big deal but it was for me. I included photos of the packaging, wish I had thought of taking a selfie with dress on"

It won't fool anyone as formal wear as it is but for something you can throw on and be comfortable in, this is nice. The fabric has a lot of give, so it hugs your bum and hips. If you're clever with altering or upcycling, you could level this up into a more formal dress. A great base for a very comfortable Halloween costume, a stage costume, or a budget formal gown."

1459,Luckyeights86,5.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"December 6, 2022",Amazing dress üòç,"This dress checks all the boxes for me. When I ordered it, I got it as a backup dress for an event in case the one I originally ordered didn't come in time. But the second I put this on, I was blown away. This dress fits like a glove. The ruching on the velvet is SO flattering, you can't see hip dips or lumps and bumps like you would in other materials. It gathers mostly at the waist, drawing the eyes inward making you look ""snatched."" It's so soft, stretchy, and comfortable, I could wear this everywhere and never want to change out of it, and yet it feels super sexy and sophisticated. I love that you can adjust the height of the slit up or down, and the fact that you can easily wear a bra with one strap and have it look seamless is just the icing on the cake for me. I hate having to wear strapless bras and feeling like my back will break all night. The color I ordered is a deep blue, between peacock feathers and navy. I'm 5'9"", about 148lbs and typically wear size 7/8. I purchased a medium, and this fits perfectly. I probably could've ordered a small for a tighter fit and been fine because it's stretchy, but I'm happy with the medium."

I have no problem ordering off Amazon and accepting whatever I can get but I just couldn‚Äôt help myself in this situation. I am 5‚Äô4 and about 126 pounds and this dress had to be one of the most unflattering things I have ever put on. The length of the dress just didn‚Äôt make sense to me, the waistband outlined my stomach in a way that someone would assume I was expecting (which I am not) and the top part someone could look straight down. Mind you I ordered an XS and it still wasn‚Äôt anywhere close to what was advertised but super soft so it had that going for it. Again, it bothers me that I had to write this review but I got it in hopes I could wear it to a wedding and now I‚Äôm back to square one."
1480,Jeanie Chang,2.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"November 19, 2022",Zipper placement ruined the dress,"The material is actually quite nice for what you can expect of a dress this price. I think that‚Äôs why so many people love it. But there‚Äôs a zipper that goes all the way down past my hips. I don‚Äôt understand why they didn‚Äôt just end it at the waist. You know how you get that bump on zip up hoodie? It‚Äôs like that on one side of the hip. It‚Äôs all ripple-y. Maybe it‚Äôll look better if I sized up. Definitely, not a dress for someone pear shaped."
1481,Jen Young,2.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"October 11, 2022",Too loose around the waist - not for hourglass figures,"For starters, I am 5‚Äô6, 135 lbs, 34‚Äù bust, 27‚Äù waist, 36‚Äù hips and I have a long torso. I normally order a size small or medium in dresses. I have purchased this dress twice, once in a small and again in an extra small, and both times it did not look flattering. The small was like wearing a sheet, and the x-small bunched up around my waist where it was way too loose. I think this dress would be best for people who have more of a rectangular body type, and I think those with more of an hourglass figure should avoid this. In addition, the material is thin and looks cheap. All around a dud."

I put it in my closet and just took it out to steam it and now the dress is ruined! What I first thought was water spots from the steaming turned out to be permanent discoloration! Now the dress is unwearable and no longer returnable. Not sure how I was supposed to get the horrible wrinkles out when this fabric can‚Äôt be ironed either!"

1484,Erin Edwards,2.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"September 23, 2022",Fits Funky,I originally purchased a medium per size chart and it was way too small. Purchased a size up and still had fit issues. The zipper feels extremely flimsy and there was buckling once zipped. The fit in the chest then was gaping near the armpits and didn't lay correctly. Suppose it fits fine on zero curves and a flat chest. Returned both sizes. Not bothering with continuing to try ordering another size up.
1485,Asia,2.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"March 26, 2022",Nice stretchy material but,"Ordered another and still have white and oil stains? Don‚Äôt understand why people wear items and return.  The midi material is much thinner than the split dress material.Got a small because most said to size down from your usual size and I‚Äôm a medium. It fit well and my boobs were set nicely (38c). It does stretch but I didn‚Äôt have any more room (6 or 8 in pants). I have boxers on so I‚Äôll probably recommend seamless underwear. Taking it back because I realized it had stains, gross! The next reason is because I‚Äôm going to an opening and I don‚Äôt want my boobs to be out so I‚Äôll get a medium, but if I was going to brunch or something I wouldn‚Äôt mind! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 and last time I checked I was 173 lbs. However, I‚Äôve been working out for 3 weeks now so my weight is different.. possibly ..

Maybe I got the wrong size but it didn't feel like it fit right. The top part was fine, around my waist it felt too tight and like the seam was a little twisted. I also couldn't use the zipper while the dress was on, luckily it was stretchy enought to get over my head without the zipper. The slit is also on the side not off the front of the dress like the picture showed. Definitely returning."

The top half of the dress is very loose. The elastic around the bust isn't snug enough to wear without a bra and will require clothing tape to keep it close to the skin. The color is gorgeous and the material is soft. The dress does have a flow but the bust is loose and the elastic on the waist band is not flattering to wear without the included ribbon or a belt. With a little TLC I will be able to make this dress look as desired for an upcoming wedding. The best part of the dress is the bottom layer and how it flows.

I just could not post a picture of myself in this outfit. Somehow it was too big and too small for me?  The lines of the cut just fit me poorly but maybe it‚Äôs because I have a longer torso?The material is a slinky, satiny feel and was very comfortable but I would not hate a liner.

1605,Sharon J,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"October 31, 2022","Gorgeous color and fabric, but...","I was sooooo excited to get this dress. I ordered the camel and darker (Army?) green for an October wedding. The dresses arrived quickly, and were individually folded into a sealed bag in the shipping bag. Win! As I took the first one out I was impresses with the feel and thickness of the fabric, as well as the vibrancy of the color. Win!  I tried the dress on and it was very comfortable, however I struggled and tried every tie position possible to make it sit right... and I just couldn't. The top was super baggy and unflattering (maybe my chest is too small) as was the elastic on the back.  No matter which place I tied the ties, it pulled the sides of the dress forward and did not look even or flattering. Reluctantly, I had to return both. I didn't have time to try to size down, as I had hoped to wear to a wedding that was only 3 days after I received the dresses. And the size chart made me believe the dress would not be long enough in. Medium for my tall frame. I had ordered the large for that reason."

Blue was a dusty, subdued blue‚Ä¶pretty and the fabric felt nice. Wish there was an XS. I‚Äôm short, shirt waisted, and small chest and it just got weird around my waist and tying it tighter meant it billowed funny in the back. If you‚Äôre a bit talker it gave a great chest to fill it out I bet it works better, but I‚Äôm sadly going to have to return."

I got a large and am usually a M/L, but I was skeptical about the fit. I'm glad I went with the large because I do have a larger chest area and so this gave me a ""fitted look"" around my chest and waist, but still left the baggy style for my arms, and then the front tie hid my mom belly.

I normally wear a 4/small but chose to order a medium based on how the fit looks in the photos to be very fitted. I think if I were going for a more provocative, Jessica Rabbit style, the small would have been perfect, but the medium also fits well and looks classic and elegant. If you are between sizes like I am, go with your normal size for the sexy club look, and go with the size up for the sexy elegant look. The dress is very flattering, very forgiving. It hugs the bottom just a little even with sizing up, and I'm fairly evenly proportioned. The dress looks like it will not wrinkle easily and is washable. I'm in love. I might walk around my house wearing it like Monica and Phoebe and Rachel did with their wedding dresses on Friends. Haha!"

I bought the green color and it matches the image posted on Amazon very well. I chose this dress because the description said that this works well for women with a ""baby belly"" and that the fabric is stretchy.  I am currently pregnant and needing this dress as a bridesmaid's dress for a wedding in two months so I needed to have some growing room. Typically I'm very slender and even being pregnant I'm not popping out as much some might so I was hopeful that I would not need to buy a dress  that is specifically maternity and I was right! I think this is going to fit perfectly. That being said, it's due to the ruching and I think someone slender could wear this well also so long as they didn't want it to fit snuggly all the way around. It's a very forgiving/flattering dress. I am about 5'6"" and it's a good length on me."

She ordered the red and it was stunning! I ordered the green and it is literally so gorgeous!!! What a shocking and amazing amazon steal!!!

I went to reorder in a different color and size down, and received a dress with a different brand label ""Fashion"" rather than ""Pretty Garden"" (which the company says is the same), made of a very synthetic feeling fabric, and sized differently than the first.

It was such a disappointment to try on because I loved the way it looked online.I asked a tailor if they could fix it, and they told me the cost of tailoring the dress far outweighed the quality and cost of the dress itself.

It finally arrived this afternoon and I rushed to try it on and....why is it so long? I'm 5'3"" and 148 lbs. I saw the reviews and got a size larger than I normally would. There is soooooooo much excess material. It's so baggy on me and it hangs really weird. The fabric goes past my knee and the back of it doesn't conform to my body and it feels like I'm wearing a weird rouched sack. I feel like I should have gotten a small, but I have a bust size of 34 F and was worried the smaller sizes wouldn't fit my bust. The large was wayyyyyy too big and now I'm worried I won't have a dress for V-day. The material is lovely and the color is cute, but save yourself the heartbreak and buy a size that is either your normal go to or grab a size smaller. DON'T go one size bigger!"

I expected the ruching effect to add a little forgiveness to the cut but I don‚Äôt see how the material used would work for anyone without washboard abs; there wasn‚Äôt enough stretch to keep it true to form. It looked sloppy and kind of Ebenezer Scrooge nightgown-ish. The material wrinkled instantly. Also, I have bigger hips/butt than chest and even with exchanging for a smaller size (lg to med) it was still super loose around my bust and under arms (B cup. Medium dress fit well around hips). Over all super disappointed, and I really wanted to love this dress. If you have the shape to work the dress, it could be great but the dress will not work for just any shape"

This also has long sleeves, not 3/4 sleeves like in the photo. Its not a total waste of money, but its still a LIE and if you are small like me (5'5"" 125#) it will obscure your figure. Not flattering like the real dress would be. Where are the REAL clothes?? I'm sick of getting knock offs.... if you're going to make a knock off, actually make it good.... otherwise you are nothing better than. A scanner.

It is so soft and a nice material. Not see through at all. Even painty lines were pretty well hidden but I still recommend the no show just in case. I read so many reviews before I purchased and I kept seeing a few mention that only one side has the rouching. I thought they were all referring to the one style you could purchase that .. well.. I will try my best to explain that dress.... It had a draw string that went from like your one armpit across the body down to the opposite side hem, that you could pull the strings and it ""rouched"" the dress. That is what I thought the reviews were talking about.Well you see...I was wrong lol. Those reviews were indeed talking about this long sleeve dress..and this dress is great and all...but...my OCD and overall need for things to be even on both sides was rather off in this dress.Just the one side of the dress had that rouching down it. I was assuming it would be down both sides.. I misread and misunderstand the reviews so that was my fault.It did not hinder the dress in any way though.It still looked GREAT.It just totally threw off my OCD. So thats why I gave it 4 out of 5.Also I saw reviews say about a raw hemline or that the hemline rolled.Yes both of these are true but the rolling issue really wasn't that bad. I didnt feel like I was constantly fidgeting with it all night. Just once after standing up and that was about it (no stockings or tights either just bare legs)Overall?Great dress for the price. Its versatile enough to be dressed up or down and used again for something else.I would absolutely purchase again in another color even with the one sided rouching bothering my OCD. Lol."

Make it look fancy by adding jewelry for going out at night or you can keep it bare and wear it out shopping or just out during the day! This green color is true but some other dresses I ordered from this brand and the other similar brand differ. Some are lighter than the photos they provide. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about this dress is that it rides up when you walk. I have a curvy figure so it slowly rides up and you just need to keep pulling it down."
1731,Krystal,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"April 22, 2022",Definitely needs an xs option,"Bought the small in hopes that it wouldn't be too big, but I was very wrong. I'm usually an xs  (5'2"", 110lb, 32A) but was hoping with the body con style it would fit but it was way too big. For length it went to mid knee, the under arm and chest had a lot of extra room, and the waist was also too big.

I'm 5'9"" 195 lbs. I typically wear an XL. The dresses are very soft & light weight, & the pertfect length hitting me at mid calf.  The dresses fit great through the hips & stomach, in fact it's loose yet flattering, but, that's where stops. Everything above the waisted was to tight, it was to tight under the arms, through the chest ( I'm a 42 DD) and the neckline was to high, I felt like it was choking me.  I sent every one of them back as they all fit the same.  Very disappointing."

NOOOO! The cut is so wrong. It is not as represented at all.The picture makes it look like an adorable sundress. BUT the model‚Äôs hair hides the sleeves. The neckline appears to be sleeveless with a slightly scoop neck. Not so. The neckline is very straight and square with the sleeves chopped off right at the end of your shoulder - the look is like a 70s muscle shirt. Or a 90s top you throw plaid flannel over to go to a grunge concert.The neckline / weird sleeves are ugly enough‚Ä¶ but also they make the dress hang in a weird way. Just ugh.2 stars b/c I LOVE the color and the thigh slits. It‚Äôs almost perfect! Except for the unfashionable boyish sleeves.

In the photo for Tie Dye Tea Green, it's a lovely, light color, but not so in the one I received. It's quite muddled with black on the top but has a distinct lighter band below. Not what I expected. I'm 5'8"", 135 lbs, and ordered a small, but the armholes feel a little snug, but probably ok as I think a medium might be too baggy overall on me (It is quite big and unfitted in the hips). I'm going to return this one and try another and see if the color more resembles the one shown on the model. This isn't it."

I purchased for a vacation but was astounded at how thin but rough the material was and how unflattering it was on my average body. I bought a M and L (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 150lbs) and neither fit or was comfortable. Would not recommend this product, just go to TJ Maxx or Marshall‚Äôs if you want something with decent quality under $30."

Purchased for an upcoming trip to a tropical destination. I am 5'6"" and about 145 pounds, and ordered a size large because I didn't want it to feel too clingy. Well, it didn't feel clingy, but the fit is akin to a tent. Not at all flattering (I'd actually assign this zero stars), and the fabric is thin enough where you can definitely see underwear lines. I ordered the orange/purple ""ombre"" color, and it's not a soft, pretty muted orange as the photo suggests. Instead, it's really like a NEON orange... think traffic cone. Not good! Returning it and super bummed. Fabric is indeed very soft, though. This is maybe more suitable for someone thinner that doesn't have any squishies like I do as a middle-aged woman."

1764,Rockin' Robin,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"September 9, 2022",Not quite sold,It's comfortable. But it isn't going to hold up for long term wear.  The stitching looks like it will pop if you look at it wrong.  I think after wearing it a few times and the seams have popped it will end up as a comfy night gown. Thats totally ok because I bought it mostly to wear around the house.  What's not ok is the price verses quality. I've bought similar dresses from old Navy with way better material and stitching for less.  Lower the cost to about the $19.99-$23.99 range and it would be the right price. At the time of purchase it was $35. Also the material felt slightly itchy even after I washed it.I am 5'6 and 230 lbs. It is 2xl and fits perfectly. If I was any shorter it would drag on the ground. But tie a knot in it and that won't be an issue.
1765,Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"July 8, 2022",See Through!,"This dress is comfy and pretty. Style wise, it‚Äôs perfect for a casual day out or in during the summer. My only con is the sheerness. I bought the dark colors hoping there would be no issues, but it‚Äôs sheer enough for me to hold the dress up in front of my face and watch tv through. That also means it shows everything underneath -bra and underwear lines are perfectly clear. A slip doesn‚Äôt fix it. I wish there was lining sewn in. My boyfriend likes it so I decided to keep it and wear it around the house, but I don‚Äôt wear it out at all. It‚Äôs an easy dress to wear around the home while I‚Äôm working or lounging and makes me look like I‚Äôm not lazy while staying comfortable. I wouldn‚Äôt wear it if I had visitors over though. I‚Äôm pretty curvy with an hourglass figure - 36DDD, thick, size 10/12 depending on brand and style of clothing or between a Medium or Large -and it is possible that slender women won‚Äôt have these problems, but I‚Äôm not sure. Sheer is sheer in my book. It is pretty and comfy though. I hope this helps."

That was no biggie. The problems for me were the fabric and the shape (lack thereof) of the dress. The fabric is thin, stretchy, and very synthetic-feeling. I can't imagine there's any cotton in it, which is a shame because I can only wear cotton or linen in summer or I sweat like crazy. Slit is cute but the rest of the dress is a shapeless sack, and if you have any mid-body bulges, they will be accentuated. Neckline is also too high. I washed it hoping this would help, but it didnt.

I bought the blossom shade a very beautiful muted apricot tone.. I‚Äôm  5‚Äô3 108 lbs with a 34 b chest , 26 inch waist and 37.5 hips. The small size in the 2-8 is very fitted in the waist and pretty short on my petite frame. Whenstanding it is a nice length but once you move it really hikes up to my upper thigh and is very short in the back . I wear it with leggings for a less revealing look.Update I also received the berry and dark grey. These are huge obviously a mistake on the label when I compared the blossom which is very fitted to these two colors I have about 3 inches of material all through the chest to hem along with huge batwing arms. Obviously these dresses are not being consistently made to the correct size . I now understand the other reviews about the extra material at the under arm area and the extra 4-5 inches in length . Both the grey and berry were ordered in the same shorter version in a size 2-8. The grey was reordered and again it came in the longer version and was really big.Update I went back and reordered the blossom color and received one that was again 3 inches in extra material in the longer version the new one is labeled a size 2-8 but fits two sizes bigger . It is a shame because I would have ordered at least 4 more colors if I knew it would fit like the first blossom dress along with the plum one that my husband ordered for me. I have ordered a total of 6 dresses and only two came in the correct size.I have included photos of the two dresses in the shade blossom both were ordered in the shorter version in a size 2-8 along with the plum that was in the correct size to show the extra material on the other blossom dress that is 2 sizes too big. It was not  as long as the oversized grey dress or berry but still about 2 inches longer .If you are 5‚Äô1-5‚Äô4 , 100-114 lbs the size 2-8 in the short length should fall above your knee and have a very fitted look without 3 inches of extra material in the chest down to the hem length  if not they are sending you the longer version and an inaccurate size . Both the dresses that did fit had a tag sewn in at the back neck area . The other big dresses did not ,only a paper tag .My husband is now ordering the forest green. I hope that one is the correct size if not I will never try to  order this dress again . It is too time consuming to wait only to have to return. I just wanted to let people know how the size 2-8  shorter length should fit .I waited a few months and reordered the grey  it was huge . I will not be ordering anymore ."

Not a HUGE deal, my seamstress can stitch it right up for $10. So I decided to wash it to make sure it didn't shrink. The tag says wash in 30 degree celsius, but no details on dryer settings. So I washed it in cold water and the water turned DARK BLUE! So it obviously bleeds a lot. I was unsure about the dryer, so I set it on low tumble with no heat. I also put ing some other clothes to help it tumble and dry properly. After an hour, it was still very damp and everything else was dry. So I set it to low heat. Another hour and still damp. I turned it inside out and stuffed a dry towel inside it, then put it back on low heat. An hour later, it was FINALLY dry!I put it on and found it had shrunk a bit. Which would have been ok, because I would have liked it a little snugger - especially in the waist area where it's very loose on me. Unfortunately, the arms shrunk too and barely reach my wrists... I'm 5'8"", tall and slender like the model and this hardly looks the same on me as it does her.

1806,Styl4mer,2.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"December 2, 2015","The quality is poor, fit is awful and I would not recommend ...","When I ordered this dress it appeared to have sizes. The description (V28¬Æ Women Cowl Neck Knit Stretchable Elasticity Long Sleeve Slim Fit Sweater Dress) had no information regarding size and there was a drop down box to select xs/s and m/l. When the dress came it was a one size fit all. The packaging was awful as it was torn and the dress was half out of the very thin plastic. It is way too big for me and too long. If I knew it was one size fits all, I would not have bought this. Clearly, you can not make one item to fit sizes XS to L. One sticker on the dress said one size fits all and another sticker on the package had an ""s"" (small). So it is really unclear. The quality is poor, fit is awful and I would not recommend at all. The dress does not have any labels, tags or markings on the inside. The packaging is not the same as the picture and there is not one label or tag. I suppose it has no front and back either. I think this is my last experience buying clothes from Amazon. I have had these weird experiences too many times. I never know if I'm buying quality or not."

It would have been the perfect winter dress but I was so disappointed on how huge it looked on me and getting it fixed was out of the question as it would have to be fixed from all sides- chest, length, armpits, shortened sleeve. It would have been like making a new dress from scratch.I loved the look, style and fabric but sadly it is huge on a truly small petite woman.I‚Äôm a size 2 and it simply was huge and saggy all over the place.I wish they would make an actual XS size because then I would try buying it again."

The sleeves are nice and long on me. I am 5'6"" tall and curvy and the sweater seemed to accentuate my curves. The green color was just as pictured and my husband thought it looked Christmassy. However, less than an hour after I had put it on the right sleeve started to come apart in the stitching at the wrist and unraveled up the sleeve towards the elbow about 8 inches. I am so glad I had brought a jacket because as soon as I saw it unravel I put on my jacket. Definitely not a good thing when its cold outside and you just got the sweater. It actually sucks that it happened as we were out and were heading out to dinner after church.I sent an email to Amazon about the product and I will update the review when I receive a response."

All other purchases we've made on Amazon from numerous vendors have been spot on in color.  This is the second dress from this vendor that my wife has purchased and both were about 10+ shades darker than they appear onscreen.  The first one was so far off she returned it,(Dark Navy Blue as opposed to the displayed Medium Gray Blue) the second dress she made a guess at the appearance of a different color and how dark it might be and she was correct with her guess based on the prior purchase and is pleased with that color.Quality make and fit are wonderful, simply be aware of the extreme color difference when purchasing."

I loved the purple color and how it appeared to fit the various models and user review photos.  I ordered the smallest size they sell (which covers a range of sizes and is its flaw).  The fact that they make each size to cover a range of sizes means that if you are on the smaller end of the size spectrum, its too big on you.  My girlfriend is petite and it looked..not good on her.  It was noticeably loose and did not have a good contouring effect like the photos.  If you are petite, this dress isnt going to work for you.  I bought her like 15 or 16 items, this is the only one we are sending back."

The sweater itself looked as well made as pricier sweaters and was pretty soft.  I had planned to wear it as more of a tunic over leggings than a dress; it came close to my knee and I am 5'5"".  Unfortunately, it is made small.  I didn't notice a problem with the armholes, as one reviewer had mentioned, the yarn was nice an stretchy and it wasn't uncomfortable at all, it was just skin tight, which is not a good look for me.  I am usually a size 16 but ordered what was supposed to be size 18-20 but it just won't work and that seems to be the largest size available.  Fit me more like a size 12-14.  If you're smaller though, I think it is a great sweater, especially in the pink color."

I received it in a great time, and it was just the thing I was looking for. However, I ordered a size down from my normal size and it's still very big on me - to the point that I'm not comfortable wearing it. It seems like it's good quality, but I won't ever be able to wear it.The day I received it, I tried it on and put it right back in its package to exchange it later only to have the package be misplaced while my roommate decided to do housework when I wasn't around. After a while looking for it, we concluded he must have thrown it away on accident and thought it was gone for good. I found it just yesterday to no avail. It is past time so I'm no longer able to return it.I take responsibility that I wasn't able to do the return/exchange, and it seems of good quality - this is why I give it 3 stars.But it does not fit to size - even one size down is uncomfortably large."

The length of the dress was shorter than I anticipated so I had to keep pulling it down. I do have a belly so it was a little snug but nothing crazy since I got the xxl.

I am 5'4"" - 125 very athletic pounds.  bust is 34b / waist is 28inches...hips 37 inches.I bought the (very purple-y looking) blue in  small and a medium and the small fit great (hit mid thigh) and close and smooth to the body just  like in the photo here.The medium fit too, but was longer (to my knees) and had actual loose wrinkles aroundmy middle (which was okay - but wasn't smooth looking).

Mildly see-through in the mid-section but easily not a problem with nude shapewear. The sleeve length and skirt length were perfect which I struggle with at times usually I find sleeves are too short but this was good, and skirt length was appropriate for day-wear without looking too short like you‚Äôre going to the club.

When I ordered it, I got it as a backup dress for an event in case the one I originally ordered didn't come in time. But the second I put this on, I was blown away. This dress fits like a glove. The ruching on the velvet is SO flattering, you can't see hip dips or lumps and bumps like you would in other materials. It gathers mostly at the waist, drawing the eyes inward making you look ""snatched."" It's so soft, stretchy, and comfortable, I could wear this everywhere and never want to change out of it, and yet it feels super sexy and sophisticated. I love that you can adjust the height of the slit up or down, and the fact that you can easily wear a bra with one strap and have it look seamless is just the icing on the cake for me. I hate having to wear strapless bras and feeling like my back will break all night. The color I ordered is a deep blue, between peacock feathers and navy. I'm 5'9"", about 148lbs and typically wear size 7/8. I purchased a medium, and this fits perfectly. I probably could've ordered a small for a tighter fit and been fine because it's stretchy, but I'm happy with the medium."

40,Robyn Weiniger,3.0,the United States ,"December 3, 2022",Sized odd?,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 130lbs and you can‚Äôt find a fit on this dress. Small is snug around stomach and highlights tiny bit of pouch (skin from losing weight) but the medium is huge and gaps and bunches. I bought a similar silk/satin dress from a big store and I‚Äôm a small but they didn‚Äôt have pink so I wanted this one. Both sizes going back üôÅ
41,Haley B.,3.0,the United States ,"October 2, 2022",Pretty but strange structure,"I do like this dress; the color and material are very pretty, and I have no complaints with the overall quality. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù and 120lbs, so I expect things to not fit properly. I ordered the small and it was far too big in the chest, waists, and hips. Additionally, it also seemed to be sewed‚Ä¶ almost crooked? I ordered the wine red with a split, and the split needed up at the back of my leg instead of the side, and the dress felt like it was tugging and trying to twist around me. Overall, I probably will not order another in a smaller size for that reason alone. It felt a little wonky to me"
42,Byron,3.0,the United States ,"December 7, 2022",Missed the Mark,"Dress came quickly and color nice and vibrant as pictured. Unfortunately, doesn‚Äôt want to fit right. Seems as though the stitching is off center such that when wearing the dress, the hem on one side is much farther back making the whole dress pull to one side."
43,Jacob Stephens,3.0,the United States ,"November 21, 2022",Seams not symmetrical,The dress fit as expected. One side hugged my waist and hips nicely and the other side had a weird empty angle that stuck out. The seams weren‚Äôt symmetrical when you laid the dress flat. I considered ordering the exact same dress to see if it was just that specific dress but ended up going with a different option.
44,DL üêâ ,3.0,the United States ,"December 30, 2021",Weird fit for 5‚Äô4‚Äù with shorter torso,"As someone who‚Äôs 5‚Äô4‚Äù 130lb 32DD with athletic body type, I‚Äôll start by saying I don't expect most things to fit super well. I was looking for an affordable dress for an upcoming wedding (dressy casual), so this looked like it had potential, but I had low expectations.I actually liked the material of the dress. It‚Äôs definitely not silk, but the rich, emerald green color and shine tricks the eye and makes the dress appear way fancier than its price tag. I have an inverted triangle shape body (broad shoulders), but the fit of the dress was flattering overall from the front. I actually didn‚Äôt really have any weirdness in the hip area as others have described.That‚Äôs where the positives stop.  If you zoom in on specific parts of the dress, you‚Äôll see weird fit. The ‚Äúdrape‚Äù across the top just didn‚Äôt work on me. I did get an S, and I think a medium would‚Äôve just looked like a bag on me. Also, I do have a shorter torso, but the back waist kept bunching up no matter what I did (see picture). Other slip dresses I‚Äôve tried (anthro, regular non-petite sizes) did not have the same problem, making me think this is a build problem, not just my body type. Also, the dress I received didn‚Äôt have a slit on the side even though the order is for a ‚Äúmidi slit‚Äù dress.Overall, for the cost, this dress is quite good. However, any tailoring costs to fix the weird bunching issues would cost more than the dress itself which is why I decided to return it. For those who are taller (maybe 5‚Äô6‚Äù+ or with a longer torso), I‚Äôd recommend it if you‚Äôre in a bind and need a dress asap."
45,Family of 4 ordering all kinds of stuff,3.0,the United States ,"September 1, 2022",Solid find/ thin/ super popular,"Ordered this for a wedding in a medium. It is super thin. Didn‚Äôt look bad but I wasn‚Äôt comfortable in it. I put on shape wear and you could see the lines, honestly only a little bit still. I wore it as a tank top and put a skirt over it. Super cute! The main problem is‚Ä¶. There were at least 4 other people at the wedding in this dress. I was mind blown. Glad I put the skirt on. Worth a shot. Definitely gives sexy night gown vibes though."
46,Heather Adair,3.0,the United States ,"August 17, 2022",giant and shapeless?,"I‚Äôm usually an XS/0-2 in dresses (measurements  about 34-24-34, 5‚Äô2 and 115ish lbs). Bought the extra small in orange and boy: this fits me in a very shapeless, saggy way.It‚Äôs COMFORTABLE, it‚Äôs lightweight, it has plenty of stretch and wasn‚Äôt sheer or see-thru, but it‚Äôs just SADLY SHAPELESS (and long on my short frame).It‚Äôs going back, sadly. If there were an XXS I‚Äôd be all over it (tho the cowl neck is a little wide if you‚Äôre petite. felt like it didn‚Äôt know where to drape or fold)."
47,Mallory,3.0,the United States ,"November 14, 2022",Great fit but fabric was too metallic.,"This dress fit beautifully; however, the satin-like fabric appeared too shiny and metallic for my liking."
48,Ruby ,3.0,the United States ,"October 11, 2021",Cheap thin material and poorly put together,"Honestly, in a pinch, this dress will do the job. It's shiny and looks pretty, color is a nice emerald green like in the listing.But the material is very thin, obviously just one layer. It comes folded so the folds are still very obvious on the dress, but I didn't iron/steam it so I don't know if that would fully fix things. The right strap had strings unwinding and coming off of it which speaks to the poor quality. The sides are sewn in a way that I can't tell if it's intentional or not. It sort of gives the illusion of curves (???) but it also just looks like it could have been a sewing mistake so it's squiggly. The worst part though is probably the chest area. It's supposed to have a nice cowl neck, but the execution is just not good. It gapes open so you can't lean forward too much unless you're okay with your boobs completely showing, or you just have to keep pushing and pinching your neckline in every few minutes to make sure it's still in place.For $22 I would've expected slightly better quality - obviously, $20 is not much. But I've definitely gotten better dresses for around that amount. The one upside is the dress does look deceptively good in pictures, though, so if that's all you care about then you'll probably be fine with this."

I didn‚Äôt want anything too tight, and everything seemed to be the bodycon style. This is classy looking, and hugs in the right place. The toe around the front is actually super nice and flattering. Material feels nice, very silky and soft but doesn‚Äôt feel cheap. Good buy if you‚Äôre needing a last minute Christmas/ holiday dress! Definitely needs to be steamed after unwrapping though so come prepared! I bought the large and XL and not sure which one I‚Äôm going to keep just yet- really depends on how fitting you want it.

I got a large and am usually a M/L, but I was skeptical about the fit. I'm glad I went with the large because I do have a larger chest area and so this gave me a ""fitted look"" around my chest and waist, but still left the baggy style for my arms, and then the front tie hid my mom belly. I received nothing but compliments all night long. It did come pretty wrinkled but that's nothing a quick steamer session can't fix. Size: 5 ft, 165lbs, 34DD"

It touches the floor in bare feet. I normally wear a 4/small but chose to order a medium based on how the fit looks in the photos to be very fitted. I think if I were going for a more provocative, Jessica Rabbit style, the small would have been perfect, but the medium also fits well and looks classic and elegant. If you are between sizes like I am, go with your normal size for the sexy club look, and go with the size up for the sexy elegant look. The dress is very flattering, very forgiving. It hugs the bottom just a little even with sizing up, and I'm fairly evenly proportioned. The dress looks like it will not wrinkle easily and is washable. I'm in love. I might walk around my house wearing it like Monica and Phoebe and Rachel did with their wedding dresses on Friends. Haha!"

I bought the green color and it matches the image posted on Amazon very well. I chose this dress because the description said that this works well for women with a ""baby belly"" and that the fabric is stretchy.  I am currently pregnant and needing this dress as a bridesmaid's dress for a wedding in two months so I needed to have some growing room. Typically I'm very slender and even being pregnant I'm not popping out as much some might so I was hopeful that I would not need to buy a dress  that is specifically maternity and I was right! I think this is going to fit perfectly. That being said, it's due to the ruching and I think someone slender could wear this well also so long as they didn't want it to fit snuggly all the way around. It's a very forgiving/flattering dress. I am about 5'6"" and it's a good length on me."

She ordered the red and it was stunning! I ordered the green and it is literally so gorgeous!!! What a shocking and amazing amazon steal!!! Based on other reviews I got a medium and I would normally go large To be safe‚Äî and the medium fits like a glove. So I guess it does run a tad big?!

It hit the floor with some tall heels and fit beautifully. The chest is on the very slightly loose side (also medium to high cut/conservative) but fit well with a pushup, the waist was excellent, and the slit was a bit of a surprise like WHABAM we're showing some leg. But it was not too revealing/hoochie. I got TONS and TONS of compliments on this dress, and I think I was also one of the most comfortable people at the wedding. It has held up better than expected.

I ordered a Small, and this dress was huge on me, especially throughout the chest/shoulder area. Style? I felt it would make an excellent Prairie costume for stage or historical reenactments.

There is soooooooo much excess material. It's so baggy on me and it hangs really weird.

I feel like I should have gotten a small, but I have a bust size of 34 F and was worried the smaller sizes wouldn't fit my bust. The large was wayyyyyy too big and now I'm worried I won't have a dress for V-day.

It looked sloppy and kind of Ebenezer Scrooge nightgown-ish. The material wrinkled instantly. Also, I have bigger hips/butt than chest and even with exchanging for a smaller size (lg to med) it was still super loose around my bust and under arms (B cup. Medium dress fit well around hips).

262,Magic Powers,2.0,the United States ,"November 4, 2020",This is NOT the dress in the photo,"This is a cheap knock off of the dress in the main photo. Although it is comfortable, it is not tailored or even hemmed! It also runs large and is boxy on me, because, well... its not the dress in the photo. This also has long sleeves, not 3/4 sleeves like in the photo. Its not a total waste of money, but its still a LIE and if you are small like me (5'5"" 125#) it will obscure your figure. Not flattering like the real dress would be. Where are the REAL clothes?? I'm sick of getting knock offs.... if you're going to make a knock off, actually make it good.... otherwise you are nothing better than. A scanner. Shame on companies who steal other designers photos and PRETEND thats whats they're selling."

So unflattering. Maybe i just bought too big of a size but it was just too big and made me look bigger than i actually was. The material is also very thick so maybe that‚Äôs why it looked so unflattering on me"
264,Hannah30,2.0,the United States ,"February 9, 2022",Sizing off,"I read the sizing chart listed and per that I ordered a medium‚Ä¶ it resembled a a large, and maybe even closer to an extra large.

The bodice & chest and the sleeves are very slouchy.  If there was an xs, I  think it would fit me well.

280,jeepgirl_90,4.0,the United States ,"November 24, 2020",Cute Dress...but,"I loved this dress. I got it for a fall wedding we attended and wanted sleeves for warmth. It is so soft and a nice material. Not see through at all. Even painty lines were pretty well hidden but I still recommend the no show just in case. I read so many reviews before I purchased and I kept seeing a few mention that only one side has the rouching. I thought they were all referring to the one style you could purchase that .. well.. I will try my best to explain that dress.... It had a draw string that went from like your one armpit across the body down to the opposite side hem, that you could pull the strings and it ""rouched"" the dress. That is what I thought the reviews were talking about.Well you see...I was wrong lol. Those reviews were indeed talking about this long sleeve dress..and this dress is great and all...but...my OCD and overall need for things to be even on both sides was rather off in this dress.Just the one side of the dress had that rouching down it. I was assuming it would be down both sides.. I misread and misunderstand the reviews so that was my fault.It did not hinder the dress in any way though.It still looked GREAT.It just totally threw off my OCD. So thats why I gave it 4 out of 5.Also I saw reviews say about a raw hemline or that the hemline rolled.Yes both of these are true but the rolling issue really wasn't that bad. I didnt feel like I was constantly fidgeting with it all night. Just once after standing up and that was about it (no stockings or tights either just bare legs)Overall?Great dress for the price. Its versatile enough to be dressed up or down and used again for something else.I would absolutely purchase again in another color even with the one sided rouching bothering my OCD. Lol."
281,krysten654,4.0,the United States ,"March 28, 2022",Cute dress!!,"What I loved about this dress and the many others I ordered (different colors, sleeves and sleeveless) is that it you can wear this anywhere! Make it look fancy by adding jewelry for going out at night or you can keep it bare and wear it out shopping or just out during the day! This green color is true but some other dresses I ordered from this brand and the other similar brand differ. Some are lighter than the photos they provide. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about this dress is that it rides up when you walk. I have a curvy figure so it slowly rides up and you just need to keep pulling it down."
282,Krystal,4.0,the United States ,"April 22, 2022",Definitely needs an xs option,"Bought the small in hopes that it wouldn't be too big, but I was very wrong. I'm usually an xs  (5'2"", 110lb, 32A) but was hoping with the body con style it would fit but it was way too big. For length it went to mid knee, the under arm and chest had a lot of extra room, and the waist was also too big. The dress itself was thick and good material, I'm not surprised it was too big considering I ordered a small and am typically an xs."
283,NMDAmazon Customer,4.0,the United States ,"March 29, 2022",Not as fitting as the picture,"Disappointed about the lack of tight fighting material as shown in the picture- should have known Amazon.

Not so much that I can‚Äôt get it on, just shows all my blubby areas that I‚Äôm self conscious about and is not stretchy so it makes me feel restrained and uncomfortable. I‚Äôm working on dropping another 10 lbs and I think it‚Äôll fit ok when I do so I‚Äôm keeping it but I got it for a Christmas party and I wish I ordered medium."
295,Sissy,1.0,the United States ,"December 1, 2022",Runs very small,Ok first I want to c/o about shipping.  I‚Äôm trying to return thisUPS  delivery. Returning their packages is a giant pain. A UPS store is 35 miles from me and I can‚Äôt return them with that square thing.  There is suppose to be a drop box at the college but only you and god knows where it‚Äôs at.  I really hate UPS deliveries.  The dress itself I ordered up a cl -xxl size and it fit me tight to my body it is awlful. I‚Äôm pretty sure it would fit my size 10 granddaughter.
296,S. White,1.0,the United States ,"December 2, 2022",Unflattering,"This is NOT a flattering dress. The location of the pockets and how they sit inside the dress make your hips seem so much wider because there's so much fabric there. Nice to have pockets, not nice to add so much fabric in such an unflattering way. I didn't even wear the dress out."
297,Ester Knowlen,1.0,the United States ,"September 5, 2022",Very overpriced for the cheap product,"This dress is unbelievably overpriced for the quality. Got the green tiedye. Outside is nice and dark green tiedye, but inside of the dress is white (fabric is thick and not see-through, but as if printed only on one side). Stocking came already splitting on the hems by the slits. Not flattering unless you have hands in pockets the whole time, or at least one hand in pocket. Wishing it were longer too. I'm 5'7"" and it's midi length on me which is kinda awkward with the rounded hem. Will probably return."

This is a lawsuit waiting to happen! It is unacceptable! Shame on you whoever, wore it to a public place obviously and then returned it with a nasty mask!"
299,karol,1.0,the United States ,"October 5, 2022",That it fits correctly. Seems like it was too small even for the size that I always wear.,Like I stated the product was too small for the size that I am used to wearing very tight in the bust line‚Ä¶ Just wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting. I did order two more in different colors and different sizes hopefully this will work for me. Thank you

I typically wear an XL. The dresses are very soft & light weight, & the pertfect length hitting me at mid calf.  The dresses fit great through the hips & stomach, in fact it's loose yet flattering, but, that's where stops. Everything above the waisted was to tight, it was to tight under the arms, through the chest ( I'm a 42 DD) and the neckline was to high, I felt like it was choking me.  I sent every one of them back as they all fit the same.  Very disappointing."
301,K.S,1.0,the United States ,"October 30, 2022",Looked it‚Äôs price.,"I returned the dress, I found it was poorly made, looked cheap, which, to be fair, it was. The length was good for my height."

The arm holes were so tiny they hurt my arm pits and the dress had was practically stretched to the max and I am not even near the end of my pregnancy. If I wasn‚Äôt pregnant I would have ordered an xl and I doubt it would have even fit at all. This dress is also see through in the light. Not flattering at all. Returning
304,T Jones,1.0,the United States ,"August 19, 2022",Just Yuck!,"The material feels like stretchy cheap polyester. It does not flow after 3 steps you are pulling it away from your body it clings so bad, I had to spray it with cling free. This is supposed to be a summer dress, it is not breathable and you just sweat under it. It‚Äôs better for winter as insulating under a dress. Save your money."

315,Rockin' Robin,3.0,the United States ,"September 9, 2022",Not quite sold,It's comfortable. But it isn't going to hold up for long term wear.  The stitching looks like it will pop if you look at it wrong.  I think after wearing it a few times and the seams have popped it will end up as a comfy night gown. Thats totally ok because I bought it mostly to wear around the house.  What's not ok is the price verses quality. I've bought similar dresses from old Navy with way better material and stitching for less.  Lower the cost to about the $19.99-$23.99 range and it would be the right price. At the time of purchase it was $35. Also the material felt slightly itchy even after I washed it.I am 5'6 and 230 lbs. It is 2xl and fits perfectly. If I was any shorter it would drag on the ground. But tie a knot in it and that won't be an issue.
316,KB,3.0,the United States ,"December 8, 2022",Too tight in the chest,Fits well in the body but very tight in the chest and I don't have alot to worry about.
317,Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States ,"July 8, 2022",See Through!,"This dress is comfy and pretty. Style wise, it‚Äôs perfect for a casual day out or in during the summer. My only con is the sheerness. I bought the dark colors hoping there would be no issues, but it‚Äôs sheer enough for me to hold the dress up in front of my face and watch tv through. That also means it shows everything underneath -bra and underwear lines are perfectly clear. A slip doesn‚Äôt fix it. I wish there was lining sewn in. My boyfriend likes it so I decided to keep it and wear it around the house, but I don‚Äôt wear it out at all. It‚Äôs an easy dress to wear around the home while I‚Äôm working or lounging and makes me look like I‚Äôm not lazy while staying comfortable. I wouldn‚Äôt wear it if I had visitors over though. I‚Äôm pretty curvy with an hourglass figure - 36DDD, thick, size 10/12 depending on brand and style of clothing or between a Medium or Large -and it is possible that slender women won‚Äôt have these problems, but I‚Äôm not sure. Sheer is sheer in my book. It is pretty and comfy though. I hope this helps."

I didn‚Äôt end up returning it at first I was going to keep it and see if I could just alter it and play with the fact that both sides of the dress does have slits and maybe do like a bunch up not at the hip however because it is lined due to the pocket detailing hemming the stress is basically impossible and even pulling some of the fabric up and bunching it into a knot with a ponytail holder it just wasn‚Äôt working if you are super petite in terms of your frame and I guess short this is probably not gonna work for you the fabric is amazing it‚Äôs not see-through at all it was actually really breathable and comfortable I was really hoping this would work out as a go to little black summer dress for days at the beach and at the pool unfortunately it just didn‚Äôt work out .I think if I was 120 and and was taller not 5‚Äô1 it would have worked !

It fit beautifully and was just warm enough with knee high boots for 50-60 degree weather. Mildly see-through in the mid-section but easily not a problem with nude shapewear. The sleeve length and skirt length were perfect which I struggle with at times usually I find sleeves are too short but this was good, and skirt length was appropriate for day-wear without looking too short like you‚Äôre going to the club.

Maybe even a 3rd.  Unfortunately, I can usually wear an x-large, so based on the many reviews I read, I ordered the XXLarge.  One sleeve seems to be twisted and much smaller than the other.  It was so tight that I couldn't even move it on my arm to try to straighten the seam.  And, it's not tea length as the model displays.  I'm 5'7"" and it was to my feet.  The fabric is nice and has a good weight to it.  I need a dress like this.  If I thought it was a fluke, I might reorder, but I can't honestly recommend ordereing it."
427,Emma,1.0,the United States ,"January 26, 2021",Runs very large with no shape!,"This dress runs very large! I am a size 6-8 slim but not petite, I ordered the small and it was huge, baggy with no shape. Very matronly! Was hoping to wear for a winter wedding so very disappointed as I need something on the warmer side. Even if it came in a smaller size it would still be too big, I don‚Äôt know how they managed to photograph it on the model as so form fitting, very deceiving!"
428,Sarah,1.0,the United States ,"November 16, 2020",Absolute train wreck,I have absolutely no idea how this dress got so many positive reviews. The material is cheap and heavy - think 60s drapes from Goodwill. It fits like drapes from Goodwill too. I'm a size 2 and the small hung off of me like a circus tent.  Please do not buy this looking for anything more impressive than a set of your grandmother's curtains whipped into a church dress by your creative auntie.
449,Sommer Marsden,4.0,the United States ,"December 8, 2022",My last minute wedding dress,Loved the fit. Bought a size up from my norm after reading reviews and it was perfect. I ended up hating the wedding dress I already had and this was a last minute Hail Mary that paid off. It was about 65 degrees the day we got married and I wouldn‚Äôt wear this on a day warmer than that. It is a warm-ish dress.  Would be a perfect dress for a winter event.
459,Amazon Customer,5.0,the United States ,"November 25, 2022",The pictures don't do this dress justice,"The empire waist is very flattering and fits perfectly tight enough that I don't even have to worry about a bra.

The material is stretchy but holds its shape very well. It‚Äôs not too heavy but not light either so there is no transparency. The weight of the fabric makes it slimming and hid my current stomach.Ordered a petticoat that I‚Äôll wear under it if I‚Äôm able to loose all of the weight in time.

479,MARK E.,2.0,the United States ,"November 24, 2022",Poor quality waistband elastic.,The fabric quality was not as expected.  I expected the sheer top layer to be chiffon.  It wasn't.  It was heavier and didn't show as sheer unless moving in a well lit room.But the main reason I want to return the evening pants is the flimsy waist band elastic.  Poor quality elastic was used.  I doubt it will even hold up the garment for a whole evening without stretching out.I tried to return the purchase on Amazon and was not allowed to. I'm disappointed and frustrated.

If you order these, either order what you normally would wear or go down a size.  There is a lot of ""give"" in the waist.  Too much actually.

You‚Äôd think I greased my whole body but alas I did not.If you buy this dress, just be sure to only lotion parts of your body that you are sure will not touch the dress.On a bright note, the sizing and fit were great and I wore my pre-pregnancy size small at 25 weeks and it did look cute on the bump."

I ha this quickly altered down the sides for more fit at the bust and waist. With a high compression underpinning like Spanx, it works! I have worn it two times, in five days.Like another review stated, water will leave a spot. But, I washed this inside out and hung it dry and water and food spot came out. To release the wrinkles, I threw in the dryer for a minute on medium heat.For the price point, this is a great dress, can wear with sneakers and heels.

I got so many compliments while wearing it, I can‚Äôt wait to wear it again. However, I will advise to not put on lotion or oils prior to putting on the dress.

674,Gabrial,1.0,the United States ,"November 13, 2022",Buy if you don't use your arms,"Looks cute. Fits everywhere but in the shoulders. Because the fabric has no stretch, you won't be able to move your arms much. It has nothing to do with chest size. I'm a C cup and I bought the XL cuz my belly is large. It's loose in the belly area and is perfect there. I have small shoulders and this thing is tight on me in the shoulders. The fabric is weird. Most flannels are soft inside and out. This is soft only on the outside. Feels plastic-y on the inside. I'd have to wear something under this for it to be comfortable. But I had it on for a couple minutes to try it on and it was very hot, so that's a no go. I'll be returning this promptly."

691,Reide,2.0,the United States ,"January 15, 2022",So much fabric.,"I ordered a small, and I was swimming in it. Overall, a lot of fabric. Very blowsy. And the skirt flairs quite a bit. Also, the buttons are spaced pretty far apart, so it gapes open. I'd try an XS, but I still don't think the cut would be flattering. For reference, I'm 5 foot 6, weigh between 125-130 lbs, wear a 30FF."
692,aimeelou1982,2.0,the United States ,"September 22, 2020",Comfortable but fits loose,"The dress is very soft and comfortable. I ordered an xs, the size suggestion leaned toward a small 70% and xs 30%. The dress is too big honestly. The overall length is perfect, I'm about 5ft tall. It comes right above my knees. I have a short torso and the waistline is higher than my waistline, which was awkward. It's also very loose in the chest and shoulders (I'm a 34A). I thought I could wear a cute bralette underneath but will actually need a tshirt or tank top because of how big the top is. I'm still keeping it because it is comfortable. I just won't wear it for family photos or events as I'd hoped."
693,Peach Dust,2.0,the United States ,"January 12, 2022",Unflattering cut,The cut on this dress is so much unflattering!! I wear between a size 0 & 2.  I bought XS & it was way too big. It looks like a potato sack on!  Most people said it ran small but mine ran large. The material is scratchy & stiff. I returned it.
694,katiecourtney,3.0,the United States ,"December 8, 2022",Poor quality,"Basic Amazon poor quality dress. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10, 130 pounds and ordered a small. The dress fits very short, will need to wear leggings or thick tights. The sleeves stop at a weird point mid-arm. It‚Äôs loose but fine with the belt, although just looks like bunched up extra fabric. The back/chest is pretty tight. Only anticipate wearing it once for an event so not worth sending it back, but definitely wouldn‚Äôt wear it again"
695,Mrs. Mom,3.0,the United States ,"October 6, 2022","Orange, not mustard. Shorter than I am comfortable with.","The dress is pretty, I just don‚Äôt like the color. The Amazon photo says tumeric and looks mustard like in color. It is orange. Cute dress, if color was different might consider keeping. It‚Äôs also a bit shorter than I would like, not super short but being a mom I‚Äôm not comfortable with what might happen when I bend down. I should mention that I like knee length or just above the knee dresses, so it might not be too short for others. The fabric is nice, actual flannel type. I wear a size 12 and the large fit without buttons popping at the chest (36DD). Worth a try if you like orange (or any of the other colors)."
696,Devyree,3.0,the United States ,"November 22, 2022",It doesnt run as small as its being made to sound,I'm 5'8 and 185 lbs I also wear a double D so after looking at the reviews and seeing if youre a larger cup size to order a size up. So instead of ordering a L I got an XL it fits okay but kind of loose. I feel like I could of gotten away with a Large. Super cute dress though.
697,lauren,3.0,the United States ,"November 27, 2022",Small in the chest area!,"I ordered an XL based off of previous reviews and it did not fit my 42DD chest. Overall it is very cute just wish the chest sizing was a little bigger. I did return, and plan to reorder a size up."
698,adriana,3.0,the United States ,"November 25, 2022",It‚Äôs ok,So I‚Äôm not sure if I bought it too large but a medium wouldn‚Äôt had fit my breast (36c) .. it was so wide looking at the hips it looked very weird. Had to return it . Good quality though
699,Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States ,"November 28, 2022",Just ok,The dress was cute. The material you would expect from ordering off Amazon and one of the pockets had a hole.
700,Jocelyn,3.0,the United States ,"December 28, 2021","Cute, but a bit tight in the chest","I‚Äôm a bit curvy, at 5‚Äô2, 147lbs-ish, 38DD, and am a little over a year and a half postpartum (so I have some mom belly left & some extra weight on still). The length of the dress was good in my opinion, not overly short or too long, which is important for a shorter person. The chest area was a bit tight, which meant it was a bit tight in the arms/across my back when lifting my arms up & you can see in my pics how it bunched up/pulled a little bit, but it could have been solved with a black camisole under it. It felt like true flannel, the one kinda odd thing was that the sleeves didn‚Äôt have the typical flannel shirt cuff to it. I still thought it was cute though. I had bought this to potentially wear to a family Christmas photoshoot I had planned (along with multiple other options), but in the end I had decided on wearing a different outfit, so I will be returning this one. My fianc√© also had said he had preferred some of my other options over this one to wear. Which he clarified ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt look bad or anything, but he just liked some of the other choices better.‚Äù I do think it would have been much more flattering on me though if I were to lose at least 10-15lbs/been physically toned/more in shape than I currently am."
701,addisonclair,3.0,the United States ,"January 13, 2022",Very cute. Poorly constructed that cannot be overcome,"I purchased two because they looked super cute. They came in and the flannel fabric was a bit rough but the pattern was cute and as shown. I tried it on and when I slid my arm in it ripped in the upper arm seam. I thought I could fix that, no problem, but then I could barely button it despite sizing up. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4, 125, C bust, petite and ordered a large to accommodate chest. It fell at the correct place for the waist seam and was slightly long but I was planning on wearing with leggings and boots. They are cute in pictures, but overall proportions were just off. I thought I had a mis-sewn one but the other one fit the same so it was disappointing to say the least. It fit in some places but not others. The arms were the worst, I‚Äôm toned and fit but my arms are slim. It made no sense for the upper arm to be so tight. I wound up cutting the sleeves off and repurposing it to be more like a sleeveless open front. It was a lot of work but it I tired to make it work because I like the print."
702,seashellbelle,3.0,the United States ,"December 23, 2021",Color is OFF,"I ordered the Red and black plaid. Though the dress itself is comfortable/soft/well made,  the color is AWFUL! It‚Äôs definitely not red and black, it‚Äôs reddish brown  and dark brown!  I rechecked the color options and there is no color option that matches the color sent. I‚Äôm highly disappointed considering I dislike wearing brown, and these colors are just awful. My daughter in law bought the white and black Buffalo check and it was gorgeous, so I recommend if you want this dress stick with the Buffalo print, not the so called red/black plaid. So much for the ‚ÄúChristmas ‚Äú dress I was gonna wear!"
703,epicnethergames,3.0,the United States ,"January 25, 2022",Not at all the colors pictured,"Decent quality. Did not work for me simply due to the plaid being brick red, brown and cream. And that simple change just looked wrong on me. So disappointed since I had ordered this for a Christmas party. Nothing looked christmassy about this monstrosity. Buy at your own risk and don't count on receiving the pattern and color you order!"
714,Arie ,5.0,the United States ,"November 7, 2022",Cute and worth the price!!,"One area was a little tight but it honestly wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable.

721,Ana B,5.0,the United States ,"October 8, 2020",It is a good flannel dress,"Ok this dress is good now... The cut of the dress is good, the finishing no soo good. The sleeves are just not a good fit and had no buttons or anything to make them look nice. The length of the dress was good for me because I am short so this dress fit at knee length for me. Most knee length dresses are too long for me. For reference I am 120 5'1"". The dress fit loose on my waist and just right on my chest, because I am a D, I did not go down at size, instead I use my sewing machine to take down the extra fabric by running a stitch in the back of the dress (it has a side zipper). In the chest I had enough room for my breast but the way that the buttons are set the dress still opens right in the middle of my boobs so I added a button (and button holes) in between each button hole the dress already had.Even with all these adjustments I still gave the dress a good review because the fabric is nice and soft, it is not a see through and I got many compliments on it. After all adjustments I do love the dress and the way it fits on me."

723,CountryGirl,5.0,the United States ,"February 2, 2020",I got a size medium. Fits good.,"I love this dress! I got a size medium. For me it worked great! It fits loose on the shoulders and the sleeves were too short so I just rolled them and I prefer half sleeves anyway. The waist is very loose but it has a belt of the same fabric that makes it look great and fit great. The chest is not made for big chested women. I'm a 34C chest and it was snug but it was a great fit I feel. The arm pits in this were ok for me but if my arms were bigger then it would have fit tight. There is not alot of give in the arm pit in this dress. I'm also 5 foot 5 inches and 135 pounds and I am skinny, a normal size 3 in jeans and I wear small shirts. This info may help. Anyone that is built like me it will be perfect! I got the size medium for this dress. The fabric I love! It's not a cheap fabric at all. It will hold. Just remember flannel is a different fit material and doesn't have alot of give in it and sizes do varry on each brand and it will shrink extremely, wash in cold water and air dry. I hope my review helps. I do recommend this flannel dress!"

Based on reviews, I went up a size, and that mostly worked well.  The body fit just as I wanted it to:  just loose enough in the body not to cling, but close enough not to be shapeless. But the shoulder seams were about half an inch too wide for my shoulders on both sides and stood away from them, looking boxy and unbecoming. The strange thing is that I have fairly broad shoulders in relation to my hips, so this is unusual.  I looked at other buyers' pictures and saw that some people's dresses did, in fact, look too big in the shoulders -- but the seams didn't stand up in the same unflattering way that they did on me.  I don't think the rest of the dress would have fit properly if I had sized back down. So, sadly, I returned it."

784,Claire,3.0,the United States ,"January 10, 2021",Very thick fabric,"The fabric is quite thick, like a heavy sweatshirt, which is great for the cold, but makes the dress less versatile/harder to layer and not particularly comfortable if you‚Äôre spending the day in a warm office or house. Overall, it‚Äôs cute. Long on me, but I‚Äôm only 5 foot :) My one complaint on fit is that the forearms are weirdly super tight, like I can‚Äôt push them up at all. The rest of the dress fits well; it isn‚Äôt too small in the body, just the arms."

787,Quinton,4.0,the United States ,"October 18, 2022",If Only It Had Pockets,"This dress is so cozy and comfortable! It's not exactly flattering on its own-it really needs a jacket of some kind to add structure, but it's become my daily wear with the cooler weather. I gave four stars because 1. It has super tight sleeves that are difficult to pull up and stay up. 2. it stretches out when you sit down and then has a weird bubble where your butt was and 3. it doesn't have pockets. If it had pockets, I'd give it five stars even with the butt bubble and tight sleeves. I still kept it for the comfortable factor and it's long enough to be tasteful without shorts underneath."

I am not a heavy person in size but I was wanting to wear them at the beach as a cover up so i purchased the double X. I was surprised the whole dress is ‚Äúsweatshirt‚Äù material.  I thought from the description of the product the dresses were ‚Äúsweatshirt‚Äù look alikes. Regardless of how they were described when i put them on they are so very comfortable, you can move around in them, you can use them at the beach, to lounge in, sitting by a warm fireplace in the winter...the material is soft and plush and when washed they do not shrink, so i would suggest you purchase the size for you.  I only upgraded the size since its my intention to use the dress over other clothes...but you can wear them alone it would work just fine and probably what they were made for.  i highly recommend them. I purchased them during amazon prime days so I got a break on the price but they are worth purchasing in all colors."

The boxy dress fit a bit on the snug side for my taste, in the bust and in the arms. FYI, I don't normally have a problem with sleeves being tight in the arms.The dress is warm and comfortable. IF I purchase another one I would go a size up for me.I thought the description said it was French terry, but it is fleece on the inside. I have not laundered yet, so I hope it doesn't shrink.

I possibly could have gotten into a medium, but the large is fine.  If the sheer waistline worries you, you can put a belt over that section of the dress, as I did in my photo."
844,Amazon Customer,5.0,the United States ,"November 22, 2022",Love it,Bought this dress at five months pregnant. Wasn‚Äôt sure if it would fit in advance bc I am normally xl. But this actually fit so perfect. Def would think this is true to size if I was a normal xxl.

872,Smalleredplace,3.0,the United States ,"November 7, 2022",Just looked bad on me,"This was unflattering on me. I am a 36DD size 6-8 and I ordered a medium. It fit but the waist was too high and overall the cut of the breasts wasn't a go for me. I was encouraged by other people who had purchased and said that it was good for larger chests-- I didn't find that to be the case, no matter how I tied it. The whole thing made me look like a big square shape, and I am definitely an hourglass. I think it was the combination of the too-high waist and the flowy sleeves that hit above the elbow. I was supposed to return it but totally forgot about it. I will donate it. The color is pretty."
873,AK,3.0,the United States ,"September 10, 2022",Trashy‚Ä¶,"I wanted to love this. The color and fabric are pretty and it fits me, and I own many wrap dresses that I love! I had planned to wrap the top sashes like in the demo-which doesn‚Äôt work. This dress is just trashy. No matter if you tie it or wrap it, there‚Äôs a gaping 3 inch hole under the sash/tie, and about 3 inches too much cleavage on top. I wanted something for a wedding guest dress/date weekend away with my husband, and this is just not it. There‚Äôs also a lot of extra fabric hanging down the front of the waist (like pleats for a maternity dress or a large belly) and the wispy sleeves are oversized which isn‚Äôt flattering. Just ‚Ä¶.trashy."
874,Danielle Ball,3.0,the United States ,"November 23, 2022",Small in the chest!,"Very cute dress, but if the customer has a bigger chest, it may not work. I purchased a 2X thinking it would work but it did not. For anyone else though, it is a great dress!"

The fit was as expected, but just wasn‚Äôt flattering on me as I‚Äôm flatter chested. I‚Äôd recommend for larger chested. It came a bit wrinkly but would be easy to steam out."
877,snackpackpilot,3.0,the United States ,"October 2, 2022",Color did not match photo,"I was expecting a much more rustic orange, but it turned out to be very bright orange. Like a traffic cone! Due to shipping and packaging the dress must be steam ironed prior to wearing to your event. Took me almost an hour to steam the entire dress. It is flattering, but much too bright than what was depicted in the product photo. I did appreciate the value for this dress."
878,Caitlin,3.0,the United States ,"October 9, 2022",Lots of cleavage,"Does not fully fit as expected. The busy area is too big so it gapes open. The rest is very flattering, very very thin though."

892,Diana,5.0,the United States ,"November 13, 2022",Absolutely gorgeous color!,"Yall, the color of this is absolutely to die for. It's this gorgeous deep red with a bit of natural shimmer (not sparkly!) that makes the fabric look way more expensive than it is. I've included a few pics in different light to try to more accurately show the color. Run, don't walk--I'm gonna be wearing this SO many times this holiday season.Note: I'm a 34B and the front doesn't quite fit as intended, even though the rest fits perfectly--I have to tie it a few inches past the start of the tie seam. It's also a deeper v than expected, I'd say only about 2-3in to the top of the keyhole, so it sits at the base of my bra rather than in the middle. But I don't have any issue with that, because I found I can tie this several different ways to work with my body type. I've attached a few extra pics to show what it looks like if knotted in the front and wrapped to tie in the back, or with the waist tugged up an inch or so and just wrapped straight across to hide the keyhole entirely. I think it's flattering regardless and I love being able to wear it different ways!"
893,Emmaline,5.0,the United States ,"November 19, 2022",LOVE LOVE LOVE,"This dress fit like a dream! I wore it to a wedding at 20 weeks pregnant and I received so many compliments. I am on the shorter side, at about 5‚Äô2 and about 190lbs with broad shoulders and hips. It was very flattering for my curves and baby bump! The top ties so you can adjust it as needed for the ladies. I was able to wear a nude bra underneath without too many worries of it showing. The fabric was a nice quality. It didn‚Äôt smell when it arrived, it was a little staticky, but that came out with a wash! It was easy to steam as well to remove the wrinkles from traveling. I will definitely be purchasing in another color for my baby shower!"
894,Amazon Customer,5.0,the United States ,"November 26, 2022",Beach wedding,"Loved the flow and feel of this dress. You'll for sure want a sticky bra with this one. The fabric is silky and light, but not cheap feeling. I was able to press the wrinkles out with a warm iron no problem. It does have a zipper closure on the side. For reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù 155lbs and a 32 DDD. It fell about mid calf in length."
895,Kimberly,5.0,the United States ,"November 6, 2022",Perfect,"This dress exceeded all my expectations! Color: gorgeous and as shown, Material: good weight, shiny, and soft, Length: I'm 4'11 and the longest part of the dress hit just where me feet end without dragging on the ground, Fit: the waist definition this dress gives is universally flattering.The only slight I would have about this dress is that it is very hard to iron out crease marks. You can iron wrinkles flat but the crease marks are still visible."
896,Allison,5.0,the United States ,"November 14, 2022","It was a beautiful dress, perfect for our elopement","Very flattering, lightweight. I steamed the wrinkles out easily. The only negative was the top was a bit too small, I used double sided tape to keep the bra from coming out. I am 5‚Äù8‚Äô, 220lbs with a 36DDD. :)"
897,Kayla Butler,5.0,the United States ,"October 31, 2022",BUY IT,I was definitely skeptical about the chest area but my husband was able to pin and securely double tie it so I had zero issues the entire night in it.

I had to iron it before the wedding and paired it with some gold jewelry/nude heels. I used some sticky tape to hold the front in place - you will definitely need that if you have average cup sizes like me. You can tie it multiple ways but I liked the bow in the front best. Got so many compliments, I felt pretty and confident, and definitely recommend."

922,Amazon Customer,5.0,the United States ,"November 9, 2020","Amazing dress, especially for the ""pear"" and ""hourglass"" body types","This dress is absolutely stunning in person, additionally the fabric feels nice to the body and looks expensive(you know how some lacy dresses can be scratchy and look quite cheap up close, well this one is quite the opposite). I also like that the nude underskirt is long enough that you can sit and move comfortably without worrying about accidentally flashing something for the world to see. As other reviewers mentioned, it might not be best fitting for you if you are shorter or have a larger chest. I am 5""8, 37-28-39, and size M was absolutely perfect, both in size and length. I think same size might also work for someone with a slightly(1-1.5"" range) larger measurements as well. The dress was also very flattering for my body type(""pear""); would also look great on an ""hourglass"" body."

First of all, Dress the Population never lets you down because they always make beautiful dresses!This one was absolutely stunning!I bought for a formal benefit, and afterwards, we hit the town. I'm not exaggerating when I say EVERYONE complimented me on this dress, young, old, women, men, drunk, sober, etc... lol the pictures on here don't do it justice because there are a lot of intricate details such as embroidery, beautiful lace, and sewn on flowers that the lace overlay so exquisite!I rarely write reviews, but with this gown, I had to! Although I did have to get it altered, the straps shortened (they're not adjustable) and the bottom hemmed (I'm very petite at 5'1"" 95lbs), the length of the slip underneath was perfect -- the alterations weren't a hassle, and totally worth it! I'd also like to note that you can wear a strapless bra underneath.**I only have one picture the upper part of me in the dress, but I've included some pictures of the front and back, some of the detailing and the slip length. I apologize I didn't have any full length photos of me wearing it. I'm terrible with remembering to take pictures!**"

I could have gone with a medium, but again I‚Äôm keeping it because I bought it on sell."
946,VickyN,3.0,the United States ,"October 24, 2022",Too shiny,Well it really does look like an Edwardian funeral dress. Which is totally fine if that's what you want. The neckline is high and you can't really do anything to make it less so. And the material is so slippery it's just impossible to wear in the fall/winter. But my kid is thrilled to use it for cosplays :)

1032,JL,4.0,the United States ,"March 12, 2022",Great Beach Dress!,"I had been looking for a dress similar to this. I wanted to make one but it is hard to find fabrics that I like. I am not fond of V-neck dresses so when I saw these I thought this would be easier than trying to make one. In the end I have to say I really love these dresses! It is not a knit fabric, which for me is an advantage because the dress hides certain areas in my mid section!  I did find that I was a little bit in between the medium and the large, but I ended up buying the black polkadot in medium and the blue in large! I have also ordered the green one. So that says a lot about my opinion of these dresses. I really like the fabric, the tiers and the length.I am about 5‚Äò5‚Äú and the dress hits me a little lower than mid calf.  I was hoping to find three-quarter length sleeves so that if I do wear them to the beach or swimming pool my arms would be more protected from the sun. But everything else is so positive for me and I could make new longer sleeves if I want with a solid color fabric. I do think the price is a little high, I would expect this dress to cost more around $20-$22. One of the best things I have ever done is learn how to sew. If the large size turns out to be too big I can always take in the side seams. You can teach yourself to sew on YouTube once you have a sewing machine-there are a lot of used machines out there! It will open up a whole new world for you."

Both dresses looks like frumpy maxi on me, hits on my ankle no less. If you have heavy chest, that may give better shape. But not on me! However, I expected that from reading reviews. Decided not to return the dress because I love the dark blue flower print. The print and fabric doesn‚Äôt look cheap actually looks really nice and flowy. So I am going to cut it short below my knee and cinch the waist a little to give it shape. Why doing all these work? Because, it is hard to find a decent summer flowy dress with sleeve. I like decent midi dresses with sleeve. Its very hard to find a pretty print with sleeve with my knee length. And my Mom is staying with me for a month, so I get free alterations üòâ Win!

1096,Jared and Jolee,1.0,the United States ,"September 29, 2022",Color is more fuscia than red,Not the color I was expecting. Will be returning. I picked another dress out with similar style called TOBRIEF and the fabric quality is better.
1097,Zz,1.0,the United States ,"November 21, 2022",Does not look as pictured,Not for tall women
1103,Lonna ivins,2.0,the United States ,"December 7, 2022",Not as pictured.  Cheaply made.  Cheap feeling fabric for the price!,Material
1109,KP,3.0,the United States ,"December 8, 2022",Fits like body con,I ordered my normal size and this fit much tighter than it shows it should in the pictures. Otherwise it‚Äôs a nice dress
1112,Alma Angeles,3.0,the United States ,"December 7, 2022",Es lindo pero se transparenta un poco adem√°s que no me gusta como me quedo.,En realidad no fue lo que esperaba.
1113,Diana,3.0,the United States ,"December 7, 2022",Hoping more sweaterlike,Love the fit of this dress!
1117,Chelsea McConnell,3.0,the United States ,"October 15, 2022","It‚Äôs plain, not for a sexy dress","It‚Äôs plain, not much flatter to it. Stretchy for sure. Appropriate for church. I wanted it for a family thanksgiving party but wasn‚Äôt flattering enough for the occasion."
1118,Christina Bigelow,4.0,the United States ,"November 12, 2022",Nice Dress,"Ordered large in red.  Great fit and not too tight  Im 5'7 & 167lbs  large bust.  Dress had some looseness and was nice fitting.  Great length  short but not butt cheek short.  Two flaws:  Main one is it smells.  Fabric smells and smells dirty, cheap and unfortunately like it came from a third world country.  I will have it professionally dry cleaned and see how it turns out.Second  mainly my fault, didnt pay too much attention to type of fabric  In the picture looks  sheer  smooth and more like a "" satin"" soft dress..  NOPE  It is more like a sweater potato sack material  Very odd.  But again it fits nice  Looks great  so I plan to keep it  I doubt Id wear alot  It is thin and may not hold up through washing  or dry clean.  I may get another color for Spring  We shall see."
1119,Kelly M. Melton,4.0,the United States ,"October 26, 2022",Sizing varies by color,"I ordered the White one in Small. To my surprise it fit well, and had a liner so it wasn‚Äôt see-through! (I am 5‚Äô4/ 125 with slim athletic build; I best fit in XS or size 2.). Frequently I buy things in the smallest size just to see if they can work without looking like a large sack. Unfortunately it wasn‚Äôt a true/ snow white, and off whites just don‚Äôt look great on me.  I figured I would get red and dark green.  Those came with a different manufacturer label, different (more lightweight) material, no liner as was on the white (not sure if since you can‚Äôt see through the color anyhow or manufacturer difference), and clearly were cut from different pattern sizes bc they had so much extra material I couldn‚Äôt make it look the way it was supposed to, and ALL 3 were different sizes of ‚Äúsmall‚Äù.  I‚Äôm going to try again with more colors to see if I get lucky and find one from the manufacturer that made the first one, and prob this fits most people great, but you might be making a trip to UPS for returns (or a tailor) if you‚Äôre on the smaller side"
1120,Jillian,4.0,the United States ,"December 9, 2022",Surprisingly nice,Surprisingly nice. The fabric isn‚Äôt the greatest but it has a nice stretch so when you cinch the tie in the middle it accentuates your waist nicely while covering up other problem areas. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 though and it‚Äôs too long- down to my knees. I definitely wanted a more mini skirt feel but I can always hem it!
1121,HappyShopper,4.0,the United States ,"November 1, 2022",Comfortable & stylish,Love the rosy pink color and comfortable style. This is going to be so cute with some boots in the fall! I have a tiny waist but I feel it would help with those concerned about their waist as it‚Äôs able to be tied as tight or loose as you like.I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù  and you can see the length in the back. It‚Äôs short but I don‚Äôt feel too short. I also experimented with a pin I had close by just got see how it would look. Hope this helps! Get it‚Ä¶I‚Äôm Tempted To get it in another color!!
1122,Mom of 3 Boys,4.0,the United States ,"October 20, 2022",You'll Get Lots of Wear!,"I like it!! the material has stretch, so it is comfortable and moves well.  It will be great with tights and boots. It goes to the knee, so it could be worn without tights, just with cute boots, clogs, sandals. The long sleeves make me think it is really only a dress for fall and winter. It appears to not be quick to wrinkle, another bonus. I got a large and I am fat -- 157 lbs, 5'6"". It does hides curves, cellulite."
1123,Gwen,4.0,the United States ,"November 28, 2022",Fabric is a little heavier than expected,"Fit comfortably,and looked great on me..Many compliments"

1127,Ronald,4.0,the United States ,"October 22, 2022",Material not as expected,"Dress fit well, but the material did not live up to the style. Material was more casual, while the style was more sophisticated."
1168,Amazon Customer,4.0,the United States ,"November 19, 2022",Comfy dress,"Originally bought it for my daughter. I ordered a medium - her usual size. She didn't like the fit. We wear the same size and it fits me nicely. I have a slimmer frame than her, so if you wear a medium and have curves try going a size up if you're looking for it to look like the model."
1169,Jocelyn,4.0,the United States ,"November 28, 2022",Good but expected better,"Dress is comfy, but I had expected a more thicker material. It has good stretch and easy to iron out wrinkles. It was easy to dress up or down."
1170,NoName,4.0,the United States ,"November 14, 2022",Lovely,I ordered this for a last minute occasion and it was lovely! I love the color (brown). It was flattering and I got alot of compliments on it!
1172,Leigh C,4.0,the United States ,"November 5, 2022",Fits and Flattering,I love the dress because it‚Äôs flattering and comfortable since it fits perfectly. I‚Äôm a short lady and usually dresses make me look shorter. This product makes me look thinner and slightly taller. It goes great with pumps.
1173,Paula Smothers,4.0,the United States ,"November 14, 2022",Love the material.,The dress fit well however if you have hips you may want to size up.  Nice dress.
1174,Amazon Customer,4.0,the United States ,"November 1, 2022",Pretty design and nice fit,"Overall I like the design of this dress. It is on the thinner side, but I felt it was flattering and overall good quality for the price. I would consider buying more in various colors!"
1175,Cassandra King,4.0,the United States ,"October 19, 2022",Not color I expected but it's comfy,"The fit is good. Fairly flattering. It might run slightly small but I ordered my true size. The color is nothing like what I anticipated. I ordered gray. It's almost an olive with brown undertones. It's a lovely color and I'm keeping the dress,  but I specifically wanted gray."
1176,Brenda Topolewski,4.0,the United States ,"October 9, 2022",Beautiful!,"I wanted a nice dress for fall/winter (actually can be worn year round)that I could dress it up if I wanted or wear it casually. The fabric is quality and not paper thin as some. Has some stretch, it maintain‚Äôs it shape no matter how long you wear it and doesn‚Äôt wrinkle. I was happy again w/the looks, quality and best of all, it was a great value. üëç"
1177,amazon.com,4.0,the United States ,"October 25, 2022",Great fit!,This was a great fit.  There was a little stretch to the material which made it comfortable yet flattering.
60,Corrine,1.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"December 8, 2022",Looks nothing like the picture,How did this product get 4 stars. I opened this package and thought I ordered a child‚Äôs outfit. Went back on my account and nope I ordered my size. It looks NOTHING like the picture. No belt and the length of a shirt not a dress/tunic like pictured. So disappointed. I wish someone would explain but I will be returning
69,katiecourtney,3.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"December 8, 2022",Poor quality,"Basic Amazon poor quality dress. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10, 130 pounds and ordered a small. The dress fits very short, will need to wear leggings or thick tights. The sleeves stop at a weird point mid-arm. It‚Äôs loose but fine with the belt, although just looks like bunched up extra fabric. The back/chest is pretty tight. Only anticipate wearing it once for an event so not worth sending it back, but definitely wouldn‚Äôt wear it again"

The mid section is a bit larger than I would have liked and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù and wore heels and I ended up stepping on the front of the dress a few times. I def don‚Äôt regret getting this dress but just things to call out. Will wear again!

It‚Äôs very stretchy and the tie in the front allows you to decide how tight you want it around the waist. I am also 5‚Äô11 and finding dresses that are long enough is a struggle but this fits perfectly!!"
474,Kim Pillow,1.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"November 3, 2022",Used Dress!!,This dress came inside out and with three safety pins in it like someone has already worn it!!! So mad!!!!
497,Dalilah,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"December 8, 2022",Beautiful but sewn sidways,"I love this dress and the color is beautiful, I would be given 5 stars but it is sewn sideways, meaning that the bodice is twisted and the slit doesn't lay right. The slit is more on the back of my thing rather than the side."
503,Texas Chic,4.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"July 8, 2022","Nice, but not well made...","I ordered this dress in black small and green XS. (5ft 4in, 117lbs) The green came in size small, and fit ok, but the material was very thin. Green has a back zipper and the front drapey part was very loose. So much so, that I would have had to tape the entire top of the dress to me or risk showing everything if I bent over! Also, green has no side slit, so was more snug around the legs. The black dress is a completely different material, actually very thick compared to the green. It has a zipper under the arm on the side of the dress, with a short slit up the side of the dress, making walking easier.  The drapey part in front is double thickness, so it stays in place better, not nearly as revealing as the green, but will still need to be taped in a couple places to make me feel more comfortable. The dress I got was not sewn correctly under the zipper, AT ALL, and stuck out weirdly down the length of the hip. You could see where it was supposed to have been sewn, and it was way off. Luckily, I can sew, so I fixed it. Took quite a bit of messing with to get it to look right thought. I would have sent it back, but needed it to wear to a wedding the next day! Sent the green back, kept the black. For $27, the black is a classic dress that can be pretty dressy or dressed down, depending on shoes and accessories."

621,Amazon buyer,1.0,the United States üá∫üá∏ ,"December 9, 2022",Save your money,"Not made well, very cheap, you have to wear a slip or cover-up (see-Through) Great for nightgown or after shower dress, just don't wear it outdoors, because everyone will see all your junk in your trunk!"
