My almost-7 year old daughter needed an oversized shirt for sun & bug protection this summer... she's about 90th percentile for height and 70th for weight, so she is tall for her age and fairly slender. She takes a size 7 or 8 in most things right now.  I ordered a size 12.  The shirt was long on her as expected, but so tight through the chest that she could barely get it buttoned and couldn't move her arms behind her back.  I don't know any 10 or 12 year olds who would actually be able to wear this shirt."

7,JR,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 27, 2019",MUCH too small!,Ordered long sleeves. Got short sleeved. But the size 10 is also more like a size 6. There’s no way my 9 year old would even be able to try and squeeze into it!

12,Nichole,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 12, 2021",Don't like material See through,The material is not traditional uniform polo shirt material that I'm used to. It's more like a guys dress shirt. It wrinkles easily and is so sheer you can see nipple colors through it.

21,Valerie,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 16, 2022","Shirts as normal, garbage shipping",Sent me a previously returned shirt jammed in a bag. Got a couple brand new and 2 previously returned. I can tell because they were unbuttoned (new ones come buttoned and properly folded) and just rolled up and jammed in a bag! Very disappointed!
22,Health Journey,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 10, 2022",Way too Sheer!,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I didn't like that it was so sheer. And the interesting thing is that it doesn't mention how sheer it is in the description. Had I known it was practically as see through as it is, I would have never purchased it. I noticed this as a different brand style from last year which the video I made on here. French Toast is usually a solid brand but these cost cutting corners are going to lose me as a customer."
23,Shaun,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 27, 2021",See Through!,"The white shirts are very thin and completely see through.  I can read the clothing tag through the fabric!! Fortuantely we bought them to wear under a jumper dress, but otherwise they'd require an undershirt. Fabric isn't stretchy at all and isn't soft.  Collar is nice though."
24,Figure 8,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 8, 2021","Good quality, snug at wrists",I got these for my kindergartener to wear under her uniform.  But she likes to push up her sleeves to wash her hands and it is too tight around the wrists to do do that.  So she hasn't actually been wearing these shirts.

26,Daisy MC,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 11, 2019",Serves its purpose as I replace every year,Does the job. But runs a size smaller than a true uniform blouse would. The material is slightly of less quality so you will probably have to replace sooner. Runs very small. Bought size 6 for my petite 6 yr old n should've bought a size up I doubt it will fit in the spring
27,Kayla Trimble,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 13, 2020",Cute!,French toast logo and sizing info had rubbed off before I even received the package. Super cute though!
28,Malika,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 9, 2020",It was my mistake in choice.,It is a nice product.  I just didn't realize the type of material and need to be ironed. If it was what I was looking for it would be simply perfect.

Amazon had a great sale on this shirt so I read the reviews. I got a 12 instead of a 10. So glad I did. It fits perfectly on my thin, tall 11 year old. Only problem is now I must find a white undershirt so it won't be see through."

48,Daniela G.,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 17, 2022",Great Uniform Shirt,This shirt fit great for our daughter and Isaac  wrinkle free. We recommend it for a uniform that needs a little stretch and is easy to wear.
49,Andrea H.,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 15, 2022",Good material but….,"The material is pretty good, but it has barely any stretch and this shirt runs entirely too small. I purchased a size 10 for my daughter and it fit more like a size 6. It was for her winter musical concert, and it would have been perfect for the occasion, if it actually fitted correctly. The body measurements recorded are of my daughter."
50,YC,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 29, 2022",Not what I expected...,Thr price was good for this shirt and I've bought this brand before. So when I received the shirt I was disappointed that it was VERY SMALL for a size 14. It looked like a 7/8 at the most! Had to return.
51,Alyse,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 19, 2022",Runs SMALL,This item runs extremely small. My daughter normally wears a size 14 in girls. I ordered a 16 after reading the reviews and she still could not button the shirt.
52,reader 412,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 19, 2022",Wrong sizing.,It is a size 14 for girls but it fits as a size 8 for girls
53,Todd Bates,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 17, 2022",Runs super small,12 year old size was too tight to be decent for school—and my 12 year old is petite!
54,MTYA,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 12, 2022",Cuff is too wide/not tapered!,The wrist/cuff of this shirt looks ghastly since it's not even tapered---too wide/loose for the wrist.  The fabric is good but it's not made right. I am returning this shirt and planning on ordering the Amazon Essentials shirt.
55,Hope Swenson,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 8, 2022","Runs small, odd collar",This shirt runs small. The collar is short and very odd.
56,sondra zieber,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 7, 2022",This is the size of a 6 year old ......,Size is no where close to the size it should be for a XL.

58,GregW,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 28, 2019",The shirt was returned,"We returned the shirt to Kohls, have proof, but nobody will return my emails so we were charged again????? The shirt was way to small.  Evidently, the seller is boarderline BK if they have to charge for a shirt that was never worn.  Buy at our own rish because if it doesn't fit, you won't get your money back"

The pattern used for this  shirt needs work. The collar is horrific, too thick & stiff; my tween felt as though she were in a noose. The arms and torso were an awkward fit and would be on most people. It didn’t stretch at all and fit horribly under sweaters and blazers."
64,Shirls,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 10, 2022",Tiny,"Returning. Not true to size or maybe this is how this brand runs...not sure but shirts did not fit my ""giant"" kids."

66,Amazon Customer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 1, 2021",Fits extremely small,"Sizing is terrible with these shirts. My daughter wears a girls 14 in most clothes. I ordered a 14, she couldn't put it on at all. Sized up to a 20 and still too small. Ordered a women's medium.... it will have to do. Only top 2 buttons will close on the women's medium but it's under a jumper."
67,Kindle Customer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 21, 2021",Sizing is way off by at least 4 sizes,Beware blouse is too reduced!  My daughter wears a 14/16 so I bought her an 18 so she’d have room to grow.  The blouse is tiny!  It looks like a 12 at best.  Not worth the hassle.
68,Nsoon,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 14, 2021",Very odd cut and imperfections too,This shirt is oddly cut. The body is small and tight while the sleeves are very long. The placket on one sleeve is badly stitched as well.
69,Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 27, 2022",Runs very small.,My daughter wears a size 10 and she couldn't fit this blouse. I will be returning.  Buy 1 size up.

74,Amy,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 9, 2022",Too small,This shirt was small.  I bought a size 10 for my 8yo.  She normally wears a size 10 but this shirt was very small.  I returned it for a 14 that hasn't come in yet.  Hopefully two sizes up will fit.
75,Sarah Osterhout,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 22, 2021","Great price, Ran small","My daughter is thin and usually a size 10 would be big on her, I actually debated ordering a small size. The 10 ran very small and we had to return it, short in the arms and torso. The way it fit I would be afraid getting a larger size would be too wide."
76,Product tester,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2021",A bit sheer and runs a bit small,Was a little disappointed that this ran a bit small.  I'm afraid that once I clean and dry it that it will shrink just enough so as not to fit anymore.  I returned it.
77,Julie,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 21, 2016",This fit big in shoulders and long in arm length but was perfect in the belly and shirt length,Runs a tad small as others said but only around the body. My daughter wears a 6 and sometimes even 5. This I ordered in a 7 so we went up 2 sizes if you count 6x. This fit big in shoulders and long in arm length but was perfect in the belly and shirt length. This was for a dance costume so did not wear all day and worked fine for what we used it for.  The shirt is quality material but the fit is off. Is truly meant to fit a slim person a bit better. My daughter is average size. She wears size 5 pants and is 5 years old. She is not over weight at all but also not super skinny. Little girls don't really fit well in a shirt that has a feminine fit as they dont have curves/small waist large hips. Therefore unless you have a teenager or super thin child this shirt is not going to fit perfect. The belly is tight while the rest is baggy.
78,Doxiemama,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 24, 2021",Short arms and wide cuffs.,The body of this shirt size 10 on my 11 year old was perfect however the arms were short and the cuffs were quite wide.  I returned it and received my money back.  My child typically wears a 10/12. She is average height but very slim.
79,Amazon Customer,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 4, 2022",White n tight,"I bought this for my granddaughter, who very comfortably wears a girls size 7.  It was to go under a sweater.  She put it on. Yikes. Perfect across back, chest and shoulders. Sleeves were about 3 inches too short and the length only went to her bellybutton!It was very well made, but odd that it was so ""off"". We made due since a sweater went over it. After the event it was washed and donated."
80,Tinna,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 27, 2022",Nice quality but too small,"Nice quality of shirt! My daughter loves this shirt. But, it runs very small! My daughter’s size usually youth 10-12 and I ordered 14!!! It little snuggle and I afraid to wash it because it can shrink. So I suggest to buy SIZES UP!!!"

86,Holly Michaels,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 24, 2022",Good price but uncomfortable,Very good quality and fits well. Was slightly itchy at the seams but amazing otherwise.
87,Paul Dykman,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 21, 2022",Very thick cotton,We had to return due to not fitting correctly. My daughter is a standard 10 size shirt and the arms were too short as was the shirt. The cotton really has no give and it seemed pretty stiff. Size up one or two sizes
88,sarah reed,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 5, 2022",Good blouse,"Only thing we didn't like is the collar... It buttons and it makes it look real stiff when buttoned, so she wears it unbuttoned"
89,Amanda Johnson,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 21, 2022",Used for Hermione Costume,"This is a high quality shirt with a nice cut, but it runs very small. My typically 10-12 size girl barely could wear the 14, and the sleeves were quite long on her (she is 90 percentile for height, so tall for her age, too). It is stiff, washes well, and irons reasonably. It worked well for our purposes and might even be worn again."
90,Jayde p,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022",Runs small,"Amazon recommended a small, I had to return for a medium and if you’re busty the medium will be too tight across the chest."
91,Ineffable,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022",Good basic shirt,Shirt fits well and has a standard cut--no odd seams. Perfect for a basic white button-down.

93,Bryan P.,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 5, 2022",Very flattering,"I really like this shirt. It is a little long on my petite 5' daughter, but she likes that look. It is comfortable and perfect for business casual and dressing up her various skirts instead of using her usual t-shirts. We got the shirt for a costume, but she'll be wearing it all the time now."

99,Linda Robinson,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022",A Child’s Blouse,"I though it was so cute, for a child. I thought that I ordered a 16 in women's as I was in the women's section. No it's a child’s. I always wash clothes before I wear them took it out, thought I shrunk it, looked at my receipt no I didn't it was a child size. I figured since I washed it I can't return it so guess Goodwill will get a nice blouse."

101,Patricia,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 30, 2021",Not true to size,I ordered two blouses feeling very confident they were the same quality and brand I usually buy for my now 8 yr old daughter who is size 8-10. I was very shocked when I opened the packages because they were not true to size. The blouses we’re two sizes smaller that they probably fit her doll. I returned them two days later and here I am almost a month later still waiting for my refund. I don’t recommend buying blouses from this seller.

103,Amazon Customer,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 26, 2019",Way too small,"I followed the sizing guide, took out a measuring tape and ordered a size larger just to be safe...at least THREE SIZES TOO SMALL...I ordered this last minute so it’s my fault I’m screwed but very disappointed... I understand when you order online you cannot just simply go by, “your size” which is why I actually measured...I ordered size 20 which has a waist measurement of 34”, my waist is 32...I could barely get this on let alone button it...don’t know what I’m going to do since it arrived Friday (a day late) and I need it for a Halloween costume party Saturday"
104,Kim Wesoloski,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 7, 2022",Small for size,This was small for size and hard to get wrinkles out of

106,Amazon Customer,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 6, 2021",Basically see-through,"Fits okay but you can definitely see right through it. Just what every 11 year old girl wants, a uniform shirt that allows everyone to see her training bra. There's a reason it's so cheap. Cheaply made with cheap material. You get what you pay for so only have myself to blame."
107,Lisa delgiudice,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 30, 2022",Size,This is a child’s shirt not meant for an adult.

109,Karen Oliver,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 17, 2022",Love the design and fit true to size,My daughter says it’s not comfortable in her skin . It’s gots good far as a kindergarten size should fit. I personally love the style and fit it’s true to size m. But my daughter had an regency for comfortable fabric and material and she has not wore it yet because she trie it on and says she doesn’t like how it feels . And I’m all about comfortably when it comes to her clothing but if your child doesn’t complain about how clothing feel you shouldn’t  have a problem with how the material is.
110,Grandma,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 30, 2022",Too Small!,Slim fit!!! going up two sizes doesn't help.  It's a shame they have not taken into consideration that some girls have a protruding stomach.
111,Katherine Hudson,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 23, 2016",Size up!,"We ordered these in size 8 for a first grader to wear with her school uniform. She normally wears a 6 in Flynn & O'Hara ,Academy uniforms, and Land's End uniform shirts. We had planned to order new ones from them in a size 7 to grow but we decided on these because they cost less and had prime shipping.  I did read some reviews stating these ran small but I thought 2 sizes up would be enough. I even read the size chart on the French Toast website that said that a child of 46 inches should wear a 6. The quality of the shirts seem nice but they are just too small. They have ""princess seams"" on the back to give the shirt a slimmer fit, so this is wear it runs small. There's also very little room in the sleeves. It is not uncomfortable for her to wear right now but there is definitely no room for growth. I probably wouldn't have her wear these if she didn't wear a jumper."

It's well made. My only concern is the length since it's a drop waist style the length was longer than I expected. Perhaps a 6x might have best.

What I would call normal sized, but sturdy.  She has several pairs of pull-on size 8 shorts by French Toast that fit well.  These pants do not fit well in any way.  They are too small at the top.  They fit snugly at the waist, and were very difficult to get over her bum - also normal sized.  The legs are at least 8-inches too long.  I know she is not as tall as many 8 year olds, but she is at least 6-inches taller than nearly every other kid in her kindergarten class.  These are far too long to even consider, even if they weren't too tight in the waist.  French Toast sizes really are all over the place.  She has shorts that fit perfectly, shorts that won't even close, skirts that are comfortably loose and skirts that must be gathered up at least four inches in the back - ALL are size 8.

She has sensory issues, so she is sensitive to things like that.  But it is so weird that the khaki pants are no problem at all but if she wears the navy she comes home with rashy red thighs.  At first I thought it was because they were too tight from a recent growth spurt, but the next size up does the same thing.  Also, they do run big.  She is a slim 52"" tall (weighs about 50lbs) and she takes a 6X in these, but she is a solid size 7 in everything else she wears."

So we went up to this size 18 and its very baggy, not te best fit, but it works. Perhaps a wash or two will shrink them down a bit."

All of her pants are too long though, so these are right on point with their sizing. She can pull them up and down easily which is great with her going potty.

I would call them high-waisted, perfect for kids in a private school who will be running, swinging, and everything else while wearing these pants.

I have a very similar style from Target (Cherokee brand in size Med 7/8), however they were out of stock.  So I decided to try the FT brand thinking they'd be comparable?!  And while the fabric is very similar and soft, they are VERY SHORT!  I have twins that are 6 yrs - one wears a 7 in FT uniforms(jumpers & button down blouses) & the other wears an 8, so I ordered one of each.  They looked a touch short when I took them out of the package and compared to the Cherokee brand, but figured they be okay.  I washed them once and the size 7 is 2-3 inches shorter!  VERY strange?!!  I'm returning. Maybe I got a BAD batch or something, but not worth keeping.  Guess I'll wait for the Target ones to come back in stock."

I still like them but won’t be purchasing these again unless the size chart shows it will be fitting my daughter in the waist and have extra length as she grows. My daughter is ultra slim and it’s hard to find anything that fits her waist and is long enough. So please don’t take my review as being bad, just if you have a child that is super thin in the waist and tall for her waist size, understand they will shrink a little bit in the length.

Whether you're an Apple or a Pear, you're going to have to work with them. If you're built straight up and down, you will have to wear a strong belt. I gave them a four-star rating because except for this flaw, they are a nice-looking, sturdy piece. The fabric is lovely, and they don't pucker with the use of a wide belt. Believe me, you will need one. And, they run a little large despite the cut, which is supposed to be more form-fitting. Having re-read my honest review, I'm changing my score to a more-accurate three. A piece of clothing shouldn't come with this much work.

The texture of the fabric is very important to her and these are the only pants I have found that she will actually wear. They don’t have a khaki feel but  feel more like a legging while looking like a khaki pant appropriate for school. I also really appreciate that they offer the plus sizes to accommodate all different shapes.  I tried buying cheaper uniform pants different places but these are the only ones that fit right and that she will wear.

The 18plus fit how we hoped it would. above her navel and nothing too tight where she can't breath or wont stay at her waist. I am glad more plus options are coming out with these sizes for children who are literally mini giants but not grown yet. So with these, their pants/leggings still fit modestly :)"

374,Brittany Jester,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 16, 2021",Perfect for busy kids,"I needed pants my daughter could pull up and go on her own. She's only 4.5 years old but wears more of a 7/8 or even 10/12 in some brands. Being tall for her age and having a big bottom means finding pants she will wear is hard, especially uniform pants. I decided to try these in a 7, they're perfect! Very stretchy, she can pull them up and down herself at school. They are also much thicker than I'd imagined which thus far has translated to great durability! Overall, I am very pleased with these pants!"

376,Ibemags,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 26, 2018",I'm really surprised that Amazon would reship something without opening it and ensuring it was in good quality. We were desperate and need this shirt ...,my daughter wears between 8 and 10. I ordered this shirt in both 8 and 10 and had to return them for a size 12. In my opinion this shirt fits very small. also when the size 12 arrived it was wrapped up in a tiny little plastic sleeve and you couldn't even tell it was a shirt it was all wrinkled and mangled. When I opened it and pull the shirt out a piece of dog kibble was inside the bag which had clearly been opened and returned. The shirt had a stain on it and was completely wrinkled. I'm really surprised that Amazon would reship something without opening it and ensuring it was in good quality. We were desperate and need this shirt for an event today so I washed it last night and ironed it but I would definitely expect better quality for a brand new item that I'm purchasing. The shirt is actually pretty good quality but the entire process of purchasing it was not a good experience.

The size 6 that I got her fits her perfectly, even though it is a little irritating that you can tell that it is cut for “hips.” This one, that I bought for my 3yr old, who normally wears a 2-3T in everything, could barely button up the size 4. It one has those typical straight sleeves that you see on boys’ shirts, a pointed collar, and a pocket. It’s also straight on the sides and doesn’t widen at the bottom. It’s ridiculous to me that a plain white button up can be so gendered but if it is going to be that way then they should advertise it clearly to be consistent.

Just for reference this was for my eight year old daughter that admittedly is one size behind but as you could see in the video I compared this skorts to an Old Navy skorts that is a size 6–7.

Had I known in advanced, I would have purchased something else. Manufacturing flaw should be a big warning to future buyers.

I've bought french toast skirts before with real elastic waists and those fit good. These are either too big or too small, with a tiny bit of stretch (not enough for my liking at all). The little adjustable waist that it has barely allows for expansion or shrinkage. I wasted money buying  2 sets before finding a fit that works, which is still too big. I won't be buying any more of this model skirt. However, quality wise, its a good skirt. Well made like most French Toast uniforms. Just don't like the ""no elastic in the waist"" design."

Value/Price  We previously tried Land's End, which we also liked, but the cost is about 4X as much, and the shipping (through Land's End's website) can take up to 2 weeks.  You just can't beat these skirts for the price and Amazon prime shipping.2. Quality / Wear  We launder these as usual, and there are almost no wrinkles, plus the pleats stay in place. They always have a quality look. No shrinkage either.3. Fit  These are short enough to not look out-dated, but long enough that my daughter isn't getting any complaints from the school that her skirts are too short.  For sizing reference, my daughter 11 years old,  5'1"", and slim build. We order the size 12, and take the back in a little (there is an adjustable waist).**One improvement would be if they added slim sizes."

We've ordered her white SS shirts and shorts for school.MATERIAL: Skorts are smooth and soft to the touch which works out perfectly for our little one's sensitive skin. And there was never the need to wash before her initial wear. The adjustable waist allows for continuous wear as her waist grows. Once she turned 4, the side zipper was an ease to maneuver at school. And my favorite are the adorable pleats across the front. The give her uniform a sleek, polished look!SHRINKAGE: We've never experienced any shrinkage.DURABILITY: She's able to sit, play and run at school with ease.

498,Amazon Customer,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 15, 2013",These seem like knock offs or Quality Control rejects,"My daughters both had a pair of the Ked Daphne T-Strap sneakers purchased from Stride Rite in the summer of 2012.  They were purchased a little large, then stretched some, and lasted a full year with absolutely no issues.  They held up great and were still in almost perfect condition when they finally outgrew them!  I found what appeared to be the same shoe on Amazon for cheaper so I purchased a pair for each daughter this past summer (June 2013).  I first noticed that my youngest daughter's shoe did not fit the way it did at Stride Rite (I had just had them measured) so I had to return it for a smaller size.  I also noticed that, despite the picture depiction, the little flower on the strap was was a separate piece that appeared to have been glued on top of the strap, whereas the shoe I had purchased the year before from Stride Rite had the flower integrated into the strap...so it was one piece.We have now had these shoes for 3 1/2 months and the blue Ked logos on the back of the shoes have fallen off of all 4 shoes and the leather is pulling away at the seam around each one.  The velcro is also pulling off of one of the shoes making it difficult for my daughter to pull through the loop.  I looked at the old shoes purchased from Stride Rite and noticed several inconsistencies.  The picture shown on Amazon is identical to the shoes I purchased from Stride Rite.  However, when I compared the shoe from Stride Rite to the shoe from Amazon, not only did I see that the flower was glued on, I also realized the color inside the shoe was a different shade and the pattern around the base of the shoe on the leather was different.We never had any quality issues AT ALL with the shoes purchased from Stride Rite but now have 2 pairs of the ""same"" shoe falling apart and will definitely not get the same amound of wear out of them as we did out of the first pairs.  If it were just one pair, I could chalk it up to a fluke.  However, since both shoes are having similar issues that we didn't have with either pair purchased last year, I am beginning to believe these may either be knock off Keds or rejects from their Quality Control department.  Since the flowers are glued on, I'm leaning towards knock offs.  I would spend the extra $10 or so and buy the real ones!  You'll end up spending more anyway because these won't last!"
499,Sabrina L. WEST,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 15, 2022",Buckle across top is an irritant,"The Keds shoe is not true to size. My granddaughter wears a size 6. The shoes cannot go her feet if she wears socks. The shoe fits snug and she complained that her feet her. After removing the shoe after a days wear without socks, she had a red bruise across the top of both feet where the loop is located. She wore the shoes once and I ended up donating them."
500,Amazon Customer,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 17, 2022",Won’t last,Unfortunately these just do not last at all. Bought them in August and by mid September the fabric already started bubbling on the toes then started to peel. I suppose if your child is going to wear them occasionally then they are great. Mine wanted to wear them more often and now they are completely trashed. The cost for two months of wear is not worth it.

It won’t come off either.
509,Lainey Trahan,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 22, 2021",Is this a true pair of Keds?,"I am not sure why I ordered these from Amazon, I normally buy her keds from local shoe stores around here. These seem to have looked exactly like her other pair of keds just in a bigger size, however they are not holding up as long as her other pair. Her other pair held up for almost a year and a half. I would wipe them down weekly with a clean rag and she was good to go. This pair seems to be cracking on the vinyl and the soles are starting to come apart from the top."

I honestly think they were not authentic keds ....my opinion no proof but something didn't add up"
511,darcey55,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 24, 2015","Too narrow, even on my baby's not-chubby feet","My mom always had these shoes for my sister and I when we were babies (or a very similar style), so I thought they'd be great everyday shoes for my one year old.  She already had shoes she was about to grow out of, so I got the next size up in advance so we'd have them when she was ready to wear them.  I tried them on her when they arrived to check on the width issue based on other reviews, and it seemed she'd be able to wear them.  In the six weeks since then, her feet have not just grown in length but width as well, because now that her feet are long enough for the shoes, there is absolutely no way I can velcro these shut without squeezing her poor little feet!  In addition to that, the first time I even tried to get them on her, the loop that holds the strap in the middle popped right open (the seam came apart).  I immediately got on my computer to print a return receipt only to discover the return policy is only 30 days on these (I'll admit I'm used to returning items to stores that have 90 day policies).  Now I have a pair of damaged, too-small shoes that we will ever even use.  What a waste!!"

For that reason, I bought the size 6 when her foot outgrew the 5. As others have stated, the Velcro strap is too short! We can hardly get it fastened. Also, when you look inside the shoe, it looks as if the sole of the shoe is coming apart from the leather ""upper"". You can see its just held together by strings in the toe inside. I was very disappointed because it is a cute shoe and the size 5 was perfect. Not sure why the 6 seems so different and of lesser quality. I'm sending these back unfortunately."

I couldn't get my daughters foot into either the 8 or the 8.5.  I returned them and ordered an 8.5 wide.  Her feet are not anything out of the ordinary, just regular sized 4-year old feet.  Her foot would go into the 8.5 wide shoe, but the Velcro couldn't fasten.  It's as if the strap is too short to reach across to attach to the other side.

548,Me,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 31, 2018",These jumpers run extremely small. It’s a French Toast sizing issue.,"My daughters’ school changed uniforms this year to French Toast and ordering the right size in jumpers has been a nightmare. These sizes are seriously way too small. My youngest, who just turned 7, is average or a bit smaller for her age as far as weight is concerned. I ordered a size 8 and it was tight around her waist. The small length of elastic in the back is of no help whatsoever. I returned the jumpers and ordered a size 10. Another fail! This size felt even tighter than the 8. My daughter uses a size 7 in pant. There’s no way these sizes (if normal size) shouldn’t fit. My middle daughter uses a size 16 pant even though she’s 10. The size 18 was also too small.I’m considering buying directly from French Toast now. I hope I don’t have the same issue as I have no other choice but to order these uniforms online.Update: I called French Toast directly and apparently, these uniforms do run extremely small. I had to measure my daughters’ waists. For my average-sized 7-year old with a 26-inch waist, a size 14 would be best since it’s for a size 27 3/4 waist. This would allow a little bit of growth in the next year or so. Unfortunately, for my other daughter who has a waist size 36, their biggest size, which is a 20 1/2, is not big enough as it is for a 33 3/4 waist. The issue here is French Toast with their off sizing. FYI, the plaid skirts run just about true to size if not just a tad bit big. The pull-on pants run really weird and are also off. The size 6 for my 7-yr old fit a little too snug for comfort but the size 7 fits as if it’s 1-2 sizes too big from the waist (even with a belt it looks oddly big) and pant length. Since these seem to run big, I ordered a size 10 for my 11-yr old who uses slim and they were also too snug for comfort and she couldn’t even bend down. I have a feeling the size 12 will be too big in waist and length. I appreciate the much cheaper cost French Toast offers when comparing it to other jumpers I’ve bought at $55-$60 a dress, but the sizing issue needs to be fixed. I’ve had to purchase and return jumpers and pants for 3 girls more than once."
549,MELANIE B.,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 16, 2022",Too Little,Purchased this for my daughter who wears a 7/8 and it was way to small. I ordered a size 10 the waist was to small and the shoulder straps were too long returning and purchasing the dress on the Frenchtoast website.
550,momok,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 20, 2018",Looks home sewn every jumper damaged,I doubt these are real French toast maybe factory cast offs. I was excited to find these uniforms for less then half of what others were selling I grabbed 3. The jumper fits but runs on the snug side compared to the original I have. the backs of the jumpers look like they have been resized from larger skirts. The first jumper we opened had a hole where the pleat was supposed to met the waist. The second one the waist was bunched in the back and a small snag was on the front of the skirt. The third skirt came in a taped up bag that looked like it had been open there was no tag on it so it was not new but a return from someone else it also had a large hole where the back strap meets the skirt. I would have over looked the backs and the snag but getting 3 with problems is just not acceptable

588,Atska808,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 14, 2022",Love!!,"I was apprehensive about buying this jumper.  So many reviews had fit issues, esp with the straps being too long — & some looked like they just fit weird.  My daughter is shorter/ smaller than average so I thought it would fit her wrong & I’d have to do some sewing.  We have several of the full front type of jumpers (I think the brand is something like Bienzone, also purchased on Amazon), which fit fine but are starting to get a little hard to pull over her head.  Maybe she should step in & pull up, but even with no real hips it’s hard to get on that way.  So they’re just not as easy to get into.  Enter the v-neck jumper!!!It’s much easier to get into & with the front open, her face doesn’t get covered & she doesn’t freak out at all. And it’s actually a lot cuter in person; the pictures don’t do it justice at all. I *love* the elastic across the back of the waist; that’s where bottoms always need to be tightened so that there isn’t a gap between clothing & body.  I realize it’s a fixed size, but my kids hate the elastics that stick out of adjustable waists & prefer an all elastic waist.The straps aren’t too long, or too short either.  This jumper fits her perfectly, like it was made for her.  I don’t know how this will really grow with her, since there isn’t a ton of wiggle room.  But my kid is petite & honestly doesn’t grow a whole lot (🤷🏻‍♀️) year to year.  Most of the time she wears her clothes out before she outgrows them, though I don’t see that happening here.  It’s well made & sturdy — exactly what uniforms need to be.I also appreciate that the straps aren’t super thin & don’t flop around to the sides. It is absolutely perfect for girls who are juuuuust starting to develop but don’t actually need a sports/training bra yet.  It’s like a little bit of built in modesty, esp when pairing with light colored tops.I wash most of the kids clothes in cold water & dry on low, to avoid shrinkage & prevent darks from fading.  This jumper didn’t shrink, didn’t fade & didn’t wrinkle; it came out of the dryer perfect with pleats still in place — I don’t iron so this is a must.  If I let it sit in the dryer, there is some minor wrinkling, but the pleats still stay.  The color is beautiful (looks great with light AND dark tops!), so I’m thrilled that it won’t fade & turn into a different shade.I wish I hadn’t waited so long to buy this style, as we both prefer it over the full front jumpers. It looks seriously cute on, is easy to care for & top quality — a true workhorse for school uniforms.  I’d keep buying these even if she didn’t need to wear a uniform!!  I’m actually back to buy more, with some in bigger sizes for future wearing.For size reference, my daughter is around 48” tall & 57lbs.  Though everyone is shaped differently, so it’s really just for estimations.  She wears a 7/8 in everything & depending on the brand/cut/item it can be perfect, a little tight, or a little big."

I love how the sleeves are puffy, unlike other uniform shirts which are square, boring, and unflattering. I ordered the navy and it's not thin like others have commented (not sure if the color you choose affects that) The only thing I dislike about this shirt is the sizing. I know that girls clothing (especially uniforms) run much smaller than boy's clothing but this is ridiculous. I went ahead and ordered 2 sizes up for my three year old (she normally wears 4t in shirts) which ended up being the small (6/6x is what's on the tag). She's slightly below average in height, and weighs about 35 pounds. It fit just right with very little room to spare, but it doesn't seem to be uncomfortable. Sadly it looks like she will only be able to use it this one semester since it's so small! Fortunately I ordered her boys uniform shirts (x small which are 4/5 on tag)  Maybe my daughter is just big? Or maybe the shirt is designed for tiny girls, who knows. Definitely size up if your child is not petite. Anyway, the shirt is great, soft, not scratchy, only deducted one star because the sizing is pretty sketchy but the quality of the product is fantastic. It's been through many washes, although I do recommend you hang dry otherwise the shirt my shrink (yikes!)  I went ahead and uploaded a photo comparison of the girls small to a boys x-mall uniform shirt. Hope it helps!"

I remove the school patch and repress it onto my daughter's uniform shirts as she grows.  She does not care for the pique style shirts so this is a nice inbetween.  I will say the amazon brand uniform shirts are better. They are not slightly piqued as these and are very soft and stretchy. I just discovered them and will buy those from now on. Unfortunately, the 2-pack amazon brand only comes in light blue and white. I wish they would come in 2 light blue."

Seriously, our morning ready for school time has been dramatically improved thanks to these pants.  Sensory perfect.  So when I came to order more pairs for every day of the week and future size scenarios I was so sad to see they are no longer available in any size but 4.

The material is nice on this skort, but it is definitely on the longer side. She is petite, but this one is her longest skort of all the brands we've bought. I ordered her usual size. The fit on the waist is good, not too tight. Hopefully she can wear it next year too. If your child is on the tall, this would be a nice skort with a modest hit at the top of knee. If your child is on the petite side, it may be too long. If your child wears uniforms then this is a decent skort for the school year considering quality and price. Sometimes we just need a clean outfit on Monday and don't care about the length! LOL."

This material is soft and wrinkle resistant but doesn't look cheap or dressed down which makes school prep a breeze.  They are a good length on her and she has longer than average legs which often make shorts and skirts a problem.  The built in shorts mean she can run around at recess or gym and not worry about a thing.  I've tried other brand skorts with her and they were a disaster,  I will only ever order these for her (and make sure to order a few weeks before school starts!)"

This one is simply a full skirt, no pleats to iron! Hooray! This one also appears to be a bit longer. Granted it's a size larger, but even at the start of the year when the dress fit reasonably well, the skirt was on the short side. By the end of the year, it was damn near a miniskirt.

She is a size 7/8 in pants so i got her a size 8. Right out of the package it looked tiny. But it did actually fit once tried on.. it's very cute and it has stretch . It does have shorts underneath. It also has pockets wich SHE LOVES.  My only complaint would be that the material is weird when wet. She got some drops of water on it from wetting her hair and they landed on the skirt .. the spots felt dry but it looked like she had stains ALL OVER. And while they felt COMPLETLY DRY they took over an half hour to actually BE DRY and disappear. I was horrified thinking the skirt would stay stained and she wouldn't be able to wear this for school that morning.  So my guess is everytime she drops some water on her skirt she is going to look like she has a very stained uniform on  🙄😩

Hopefully they change this design flaw in the futureI chose a size 8 for my 7 year old because she’s tall. But the waist is big on her, should have gotten a 7. My 9 year old fits the size 8 perfectly; she’s tall and average weight.I recommend NOT sizing up, and check waist measurements on child and size-chart (which I didn’t do)"

They are very reasonably priced, durable, and they offer special little touches missing from other uniform makers.  My daughter HATES wearing uniforms, but something as simple as an extra pleat, buckle, bow, or - in this case- white stripe makes her feel a bit fancier.What I didn't even realize when I ordered this (in a panic because she had outgrown every skirt/skort over the summer without my realizing it) was that this was a skort.  I missed that detail and it was a happy surprise when she didn't need a pair of kick shorts under it that day.If you're a parent of a kid who is new to the uniform game, I would recommend this brand (and this skort!) highly.  I'm a multi-time repeat customer."

It has a nice ""flair"" and my daughter likes the contrast waistband.  My daughter says the built in shorts are comfortable.  And it doesn't look ""cheap"".I bought 6 different skirts/skorts from different manufacturers and this skirt won - it was by far the nicest and most comfortable of the bunch!My only issue is that it appears this skirt has been discontinued (I could only find it at CookiesKids) - which makes me sad that they may not be available next year!

Great for school uniform at half the cost. BUT... I ordered a size 5 for my 5 year old because she currently wears a 5 now in her school uniform.  And this shirt runs smaller than her school uniform brand of the same size.  The waist is about 2 inches too small on these (1 inch on each side).  And about 2-3 inches too short on the hem.  Otherwise it would have been perfect.  So I will be sending this back to get the larger size and hopefully that will fit.  I hope this helps.

It's like the rise on the little shorts is smaller than the rise on the skirt so my daughters couldn't pull it up high enough and there was a weird bubble just below the waist. Maybe the short part shrunk in dryer but not the skirt.  Also, you have to size down for skinny girls.

Expected the blues to be bright, as they are in the photo, but the skirt was a dark plaid (similar to the green plaid picture), and the blues were a dark greyish blue that reminded me of a military school uniform.  It was longer than I expected, but I actually liked the length, and the waist was larger than expected, but it is adjustable, so we made it work.  It arrived perfectly pressed and ready to wear, and actually looks somewhat neater than the photo.  I have not yet washed it to see how it will fare with washing.

The length is fine however.  The waist and hip meaurements are not true to what you actually get in the finished product.

It came nowhere close to zipping. Decided to order an 8 because a size 7 was not available. It is plenty big for her to grow into and does have an adjustable waist if we want to wear it sooner. Length of sizes were great but waist runs small- my daughter doesn’t even wear a 7 in anything and we had to go up to an 8 in this. Now I know for future orders"

The skirt is more like a size 14.

I’m an adult, 5’5, 125 and i usually wear a size 6. I had to guess on the sizing and got an youth 18. It was quite large still. I’d say it’s a women’s M/L or an 8/10. I was able to roll the top a couple times and it worked fine.The fabric is thick and slightly itchy, as you’d expect from a uniform skirt. Only pleated in front.  The length was way longer than expected, fully down to my knees, though it looked shorter in the pics."
1025,Ulbsterx,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 28, 2016",Cute and fits well!,"I ordered this for ""Cultural fun day"" at my daughter's school. The kids were asked to wear clothing that represented their culture(s). We needed an outfit that represented Germany, Scottland, Mexico and Africa. I chose this in the navy/dark green to represent Scotland even though it isn't the correct tartan for our family. The colors are very pretty, it has attached shorts, an adjustable waist and is made from a slightly ""stiff"" woven fabric that doesn't wrinkle. It's definitely cute enough that she will wear it again. For reference, she is 6 yrs old and tall and thin. She generally wears a 5 or 6 and we ordered a 6 in this kilt. It fit well and because the waist is adjustable we were able to make it small enough for her. Amazon had it for a great price and I would recommend it."

Waist 26 inches, Hips 39 inches. this skirt came up to my belly button and went down to about 4 inches above the knee.  I ordered a size 18 based on others customers recommendations and it was WAY too big. The waist gaped on me, so much so I'm going to have to take it in about two inches on each side, but I'm going to assume that's my error in sizing rather than the companies. Anyway the material is nice and seems rather durable and it looks exactly like the picture. I need to hem the skirt a few inches for what I need but if you want a more conservative skirt this one is perfect."

I tightened the elastic tabs in the back which didn't help - the skirt was still too loose and long, and now looked all scrunched up in the back instead of hanging smoothly.

Yes...she still wore it since we didn't have time to get anything else, but struggled out of this as soon as school was over.It's a shame because it's very cute.

For starters they run stupidly small, like I usually wear a 7 in juniors but read the comments and ordered up 2 sizes but the 11's were still uncomfortably snug (read CRAZY muffin top, and I thought my thighs were going to hulk out and rip my pants) small. But these pants also ran absurdly long. I am 5'3"", and it seemed like I had about an extra foot of fabric in the legs. Since I am on the shorter side I usually expect my pants to be a tad long, but not by and entire foot. So overall my experience of trying these pants on was not unlike feeling like I was being swallowed by a snake. Unpleasant. I don't know if Izod expects everyone who shops in their juniors section to be over 6' tall and very skinny or if I just got a weird pair but obviously I returned them and have continued on my quest for fashionably modern work clothes.

I normally wear size 0-1, and can usually even fit a girls 14-16, but after reading reviews, i decided to order a size 3, hoping 1 size up was enough. I bought these for a uniform that requires me to tuck in a shirt (a very thin one at that), but my hand barely fits in enough for me to even tuck my shirt in. I won't go in too much about how small these pants are, because bottom line: they're too small.Second off, ""Stretch"" is in the item title, but this fabric does not stretch AT ALL. I was also hoping if they were a tad bit too small, there would at least be some stretch that could allow me to squeeze (like leggings) but absolutely none at all.I would pass on these pants, and would rather go out to the mall and try on pants with proper sizing."

1115,ActlSize,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 14, 2017",Sizing makes no sense at all,I don't know whether to say these are too small or too big because they are both. I am 95lbs and 5 foot. I normally wear a size 00 or even children's sizes like 12 or 14 in jeans. I ordered a 1 since that was the smallest size option. They are a little too snug fitting in the waist for my liking and I was afraid if I washed them they might shrink and be way too small. But the legs were incredibly baggy! It made no sense. Nobody with that waist size would ever be able to fill the legs. Not only too long but too wide. I could fit two of my legs in one side. I also bought a pair of very similar Lee Uniform pants in a size 0 and the waist was WAY bigger. These pants confuse me. But I gave two stars for free returns and they seemed to be good quality pants if they had fit. There's no point in exchanging though cause I doubt the legs will ever be skinny enough.

Should have just skipped this buy, will be returning. Previews reviews said to size up i usually wear a 5 in juniors so i went on and got a size 7. The leg and thigh area was a bit baggy, but i did not mind since i move a lot at work figured the extra room would come in handy. The waist part of the pants was too small not a size seven at the waist it was more like a size 3.Also, the button was on the left side which i found very odd and inconvenient.

I was very worried about what size to order after reading other reviews because they all said how small the pants run.  My daughter is approximately 5'1, weighs 102 lbs, and has a 24 inch waist.  She usually wears a size 0 in adult women's sizes or a 1 in juniors.  Most reviews said to size up 1-2 sizes at least, and since my daughter is so small and thin I figured one size up would be perfect.  We ordered a size 3.The pants fit well, although they are a smidge big in the waist but nothing a belt doesn't fix.  They fit snugly in the thigh which she prefers, but as skinny as she is she would have had a problem if she wasn't so small.  The length was several inches too long (she's very short) but it was nothing some iron on hem tape couldn't handle or a traditional, seamstress done hem.Overall I was very pleased with the pants and these will be her go-to work pants.  I'm grateful I was able to read reviews from other customers to know to order a size larger and wanted to add our experience so it could help anyone trying to choose the right size for them.  Basically the pants will likely need a hemming if you're less than 5'4, and definitely go up at LEAST one size if not two, depending on how big your thighs are."

The fabric is very high quality and the look is professional. I am 5'4"" and the length is perfect for me.These pants are vastly superior to the competition.I also ordered similar styles in Nautica (both Junior size 1 and Big Girl size 14) and Lee (curvey (not my spelling) 0). Nautica and Lee are noticeably cheaper looking with thinner fabric and don't look as if they will hold up as well."

Seeing from other reviews that they do fit small, I got a size bigger than I normally would have.  I would call these ""super skinny"" rather than just ""skinny"".  With my daughter being tall and thin, the one size bigger was the perfect length (even allowing for some room for shrinkage).  Her typical size just barely fit, but were skin tight.  Wanting more modesty, we went with the size bigger.  These pants are a great quality for the price. They get a lot of wear throughout the school year.  I wish I had the money to buy several pair to rotate."

My daughter lived in them for 6 months and the were looking a bit worn so I bought a second pair in January (same size - toddler 10 M). I immediately noticed some slight differences- the rubber sole had a different pattern (her old pair had hearts, the new pair had stripes). But the biggest difference is the strap is too short. Other reviews mention this too. I’m convinced the two shoes came from different sources. Two orders of the exact same show 7 months apart and they are very different. I’ve had too much personal or work stresses to return these and she needed shoes, so I strap them best I can and force her to wear them. I’m extremely disappointed by the inconsistency of Keds.

I’ve always loved putting her in them because they match everything, give her good support and are just so darn cute. I ordered these (we’ve always had the T-strap style before) and I was so excited because I love the Mary Jane style. I put them on her and they fit pretty good (a little big but I ordered them a .5 size too big on purpose)... until they would hardly strap on because the strap was so short!! The strap literally catches about 2cm of the Velcro, with about an inch or more of Velcro on the shoe. When she walks in them, her foot falls right out because the Velcro comes undone so easily. Needless to say, I will be returning them ASAP. For $40 I expected so much more. The only reason I’m giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love the brand and these are still extremely cute. I hope this is some kind of defect. I should have listened to the other reviews saying the same thing about these shoes!"
1198,John B. ,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 4, 2021",Sizing is crazy,The sizing is so weird on these Keds Mary Janes. I’ve tried 3 different pairs and none of them fit and their size chart is so hard to understand. I tried measuring the baby’s foot and the baby’s shoes that fit and follow the size chart and then when I did find a pair that for her length they toe part was too tight for her foot. I just gave up.

1200,Emily A.,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 25, 2015",Straps Too Short!,"I am an avid Amazon Prime user - I mean I buy everything through Amazon - but I rarely post reviews/complaints. I research before I purchase and usually heed warnings. Many buyers of this product warned that the straps are just too small. I hocked this up to their kids having large feet (even though they said otherwise) and purchased anyways. Shoes were delivered promptly & and size-wise, fit great. The strap renders them useless. It's just too small to fit my petite little 2 year old's feet - and I bought them a while size up than what she's currently wearing. See photo - straps are pulled tight, without socks and barely fasten. Other reviewers said they returned from Amazon and purchased from an actual store and the shoes were perfect.  They are super cute and great quality otherwise...I'm requesting a refund & not a replacement. I don't trust this batch of Keds."

1202,LAMC82,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 9, 2012",Wanted to love these...,"I was looking for a basic shoe for my daughter to wear in the summer and fall (with socks or tights).  I saw these and ordered them immediately.  Based on reviews from this site, I ordered her a 4 wide even though she has an average width foot.  When they arrived, I noticed right away that they looked narrow.  When I tried them on her, I could hardly buckle the strap halfway and the bridge of her foot was puffing out of the opening when I stood her up.  I figured I should just forget about attempting to try them on her with socks.  It seems to me that Keds average width is actually very narrow and the wide width is fairly average.  I wanted to love these as they were just what I was looking for and seem sturdy, but until Keds gets their sizing right, I won't be ordering any more shoes from them.  Very Disappointed."
1203,Megan Evans,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022",Good while they lasted,We really liked these shoes for school!!

My daughter normally wears a size 11, so I ordered the 11.5 regular (not the wide) since she has a narrow and skinny foot to begin with! I was surprised the strap could barely reach the Velcro. If anything I’d recommend to get the wide so the strap will reach further. I was disappointed with the strap. I’m keeping them since I needed a white shoe for her kindergarten graduation and she’ll probably wear for one day but definitely order the WIDE for a normal size foot!"

1210,Jane Mitchell,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 14, 2017",Small Size Great. Bigger Size BAD.,"We bought a second pair after the first pair (age 3-4, size 8) fit great and worked for 1 whole year!  (Very soft and fit across top, adjusting with her foot growth.) But this size up, size 10M, is a poor fit. The strap that goes over the foot and velcros is TOO SMALL in comparison to the length of the shoe. It does not stretch far enough over the top of the foot,through the loop, and velcro. So, it feels too small/tight, even though there's plenty of space in her toe. I bought for the beginning of school and she just wore them a few times, but it doesn't stretch or loosen up. Big bummer. I will see about getting a refund and/or talking with KEDS directly. The smaller size is good. The bigger size 10M is not a good design."
1211,Megan Balongue,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 22, 2014",One show was slightly different than the other,"I love KEDS for little girls.  They last forever and are easy for toddlers to put on themselves.  What I didn't like about these shoes has more to do with the distributor than with KEDS (i think).  One shoe had a different sole than the other, the part below the strap that shoes your socks was cut out significantly larger than the other shoe and the trim around the sides was not put on the same way as the other one,  I wanted to return them but my daughter refused to take them off.  My child's feet are narrow and it surprised me that the straps on both shoes barely pulled across enough to cover the velcro.  About 80% of the velcro shows and it looks like they fit poorly.  I checked out these shoes at numerous shoe stores and they had the velcro issue but nine of the others, so I will no longer order them from Amazon."
1212,Ms.Taz,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 18, 2019",A little support here,I love the look of the shoes and the color is a true navy but.... I remember when I wore Keds as a little girl they had more arch support in them. That was why I have always bought Keds for my children and grandchildren. These have none but the way the shoe is made the strap across the top fasten it appears to support the foot right at the arch of the foot.
1213,K Craig,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 15, 2022",Great school shoes,"I can’t even count how many pairs of these shoes I’ve purchased for my girls. These are great, sturdy school shoes that are easy for little hands to put on and they look so cute with or without socks. I’ve noticed through the many pairs that once the lining starts to come up and wrinkle, you’ll fight with it daily, though your kids should get lots of use before this starts to happen. The blue keds logo on the back seems to break off early in the shoe’s life, but the shoes keep on keeping on."

1216,Penelope Campbell,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 24, 2015",Run very narrow but otherwise a great shoe!,"These shoes are almost perfect. I have bought them twice for my daughter now, but both times I have been disappointed with the width. She can wear regular shoes in most cases, but even the wide width in these seems too narrow. It's difficult to fasten the strap all the way closed, so instead it gets fastened half way off the velcro (which looks weird) and often flies open, which frustrates my daughter. I think it may be due to her high arches and not due to the width of the shoe, and I have seen the same half-way fastening on other kids with these shoes, so I don't think it is a problem unique to ""wide width"" kids. On the other hand, you can wash these by spot cleaning or even throw them in the washing machine, and they look as good as new! Cool!"

Based upon all the other reviews I read, I went ahead and ordered wide, although I believe her feed are normal width for a toddler. I'm glad I did order them wide, however the Velcro fastening strap seems to be short.  We could only fasten using about half an inch of Velcro which was disappointing because they very easily came unfastened.We started her shoe collection using Stride Rite's so these are quite a departure from that brand. The sole is much stiffer and leather needs to broken in.  All in all, I've loved Keds since I was a kid and these reflect great Keds quality."

I do think they run quite narrow, though.  We order her a wide and it is much narrower than wides from other shoe brands (e.g. Stride Rite), and in fact, seems narrower than many other regular width shoes.  We order half a size up to help compensate, but they still don't fit her perfectly.  We really like the shoes, though (cute and the perfect balance of dressy and casual) so we keep buying!  The fit is not good enough for them to be her everyday shoes, but fine for using once or twice a week."

She’s only wore the navy ones and I just now bought the white ones to wear with regular clothes so I can’t speak for how well they hold up yet! My daughter is into 11s but I sided up to 12s to give her growing room. The way they are designed, they don’t slip so that has also been a plus!"

1230,Kristen D.,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 27, 2014","Adorable, run big","These shoes are adorable and reasonably priced. They were shipped and arrived all within 4 days. When I took my daughter to get measured about a month ago, I was told to order size 8.5. She's been steadily wearing size 8 pretty much all winter, snow boots, uggs, etc have all been 8's with a tad of room to grow. So I always order her shoes online to save money and I wanted to find something for spring, and I loved these. Considering all of the last several months her wearing an 8 and the new shoes aren't going to be worn for another 1-2 months, I definitely wanted to size up a little and follow the advice of the professional at the shoe store. So I ordered an 8.5 which was ginormous. I'm assuming keds run on the larger side, because there was literally an entire inch gap. I decided to exchange for the 8, which have come already by the way! They were delivered like 3 days later! The 8 is still plenty big on her. I will keep the 8 because I feel with the Velcro strap in 1-2 months they'll start to fit a little better, and hopefully last throughout summer. There is still plenty of room to grow in the 8 so I think it my best bet! With keds (this style in particular)I would recommend to order the size your child is wearing if it's for upcoming months. It seems they run atleast a half size bigger."
1231,lm1974,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 15, 2014",Daughter loves these shoes for daily wear with school uniform,"My daughter has had a pair in size 11 that she's worn all school year (uniform requires white, dark blue or red solid colored, non-embellished shoes) and they're just now showing signs of wear at the toe, so I went ahead and got her a new pair, to be ready if/when the old ones came apart (which hasn't happened) or got too small... well, of course, she wants to wear the new ones now, so, fine.  :-)  She has to wear shoes that are appropriate for PE, and these have plenty of cushion to fit the bill.  These shoes hold up REALLY well.  Daughter (and I) love them b/c she can easily put them on herself.  They also come in white, which I love just as much, but this dark blue color never shoes dirt :-) .  I absolutely recommend these, my daughter will have several more pair as she grows.  They are worth every penny.  Oh, and my daughter tends to have stinky feet and I haven't noticed these smelling bad... not sure if it's 'cause she always has socks on with them, or they just don't tend to absorb odors.  Either way, I give them 5+ stars, this is her 3rd of many pair to come :-).  Happy shopping!"
1232,M.A,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 15, 2019",If the straps are too short order a wide,"I buy my daughter Keds every summer, they are extremely durable and I never have a problem with the white peeling off unlike ""knock off"" versions sold at major chain stores. I used to buy the T-strap style when she was a baby but recently switched to these. They are genuine Keds brand , which do tend to run just ever so slightly narrow. After seeing the reviews stating the strap was too short I chose to purchase both the regular and the wide in the same exact size soI could see if that would make a difference. I've attached a picture to show how the wide fits her foot exactly the same but with the strap being able to come all the way down. If your child has thin or narrow feet then the straps should be just fine in the normal width."

1235,Linee7B,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 4, 2022","Suits the purpose, relatively cute style, not a perfect fit.","Like so many things today, the quality is somewhat lacking; however, it will suffice. The cut is straighter through the abdomen  and hips, but wider at the waist. My daughter has a thicker waist and very narrow hips; yet this skirt did not fit her proportionally. I opted for a size larger so the tightest part of the skirt would not be too snug. The waist is too big, but won't show, since it will be worn under a uniform vest that covers it. It does not have belt loops for wearing a belt; but suspenders would actually look cute with this skirt style. If the abdomen and hips don't get too tight by the time her waist fits, we should get another season or year's wear out of it. The fabric looks like it won't require much ironing, if any at all. Hopefully the fabric won't prick or pill. Time will tell after a few wears and washings. I will try to remember to post a follow-up review if the fabric proves to disappoint."

1240,Odessa,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 29, 2022",Meh,"We used wonderful French Toast skooters last year that had elastic in the back, and a zipper and hook closure on the side.  The material of those skooters was awesome! No worries about ever having to iron or wear and tear.  My daughter outgrew them, and these still look like I just bought them!Unfortunately, I cannot find this same style, so I've been trying different French Toast skooter styles.  We recently tried the one with the pleats, and two buckles on front, and found the size 7 and 8 were the same width, and couldn't fit my daughter correctly.I ordered a size 10 of this one, and it does have a full elastic waist which is perfect! It does fit her, but is a tad too long due to us having to go up so high on sizing.  She's only 6 1/2, but weighs 60 pounds, and French Toast does not have plus size that I could find.  The fabric of this skirt is ok.  Literally just ok.  It is not no iron needed or wrinkle free at all.  I ended up going to our local Walmart, of all places, and found skooters there in a size 8 that fit my daughter perfectly! And is the exact same material of the older French Toast skooters.  All for a whopping $10 a skirt.  I feel like an idiot paying more $$ for the French Toast brand now.Again, this skirt is ok, but not worth the price when a local store has better quality material."

If you want hipster pants that don't adhere to a natural waist and need to be really tight to not fall off, great.  On my 4 year old they were ridiculous.  She's quite trim, but is 4t.  These fit more like 5t, and even with the tightening ridges fit strange.  They really hugged her butt, which was odd in her age group, but ended up being really baggy at the waist.  Was like they expected pubescent hips.  Adjusted the waist so they wouldn't fall off has just lead to massive wedges. They were indeed slim legs, but very long.  Shorter that the regular non adjustable waist paints.  Going to get a different brand.  They look cute, but I'd consider this ""style"" for teens."

I've been purchasing them for 6 years now, since my kids started school.  Mostly online and lately have been seeing them (seasonal) at my local Costco.I do love the material, the durability and quality.  They last for the school and then some (my youngest gets her sister's hand me downs and then I give them to my friend who's daughter always seems to be a size behind my youngest). These particular pants come reinforced at the knees (built-in pads on the inside), so that is a huge plus.However, I have the size down on (8 and 14) that are getting small on my kids, but can still wear then (button and zip).  These are the next size up (10 and 16) barely go up their thighs, let alone, button and zip them.  The ones sold at my local Costco seem to run a bit bigger (size 10 skirts and skorts are huge!). Thank goodness for Amazon that allows for free returns.  I used to buy them on the actual French Toast Website and would basically eat the ones that didn't fit (donated them to the school nurse who gives them to kids in need).  I will be returning these and trying dickies (who also make uniform pants and their sizes are pretty consistent)."

She also says it pulls when she tries to bend her leg, like it doesn't move with her.  I'm not sure if that's just part of her fashion conscious brain in search of more faults.The pants are adjustable-waisted but it did not need adjusting.  She's not a large child.  Until a few months ago, she was a competitive gymnast.  So, buy larger if you need extra room for girth.Ugly.  She can't get past it.  Given that she's only using these for band and she'll be hidden somewhere in the back row, I highly doubt anyone will be looking at the flared bottom.  Oh, well."

In French toast uniform shorts she's wearing a 10 and they just fit. Also I think it should be noted that these are very wide boot cut legs, that appear like giant bell bottoms.

She is a perfect size 6 in length with other brands and we never have a problem with them being too short. The waist is adjustable and that is a must since she is on the thin side.

She is not tall and the pants that fit her waist offers us inches of material that have to be hemmed to fit the leg. I ordered for her what I thought would be the right length of leg and let us adjust the waist as needed. Turns out the waist fit fine and the leg was about right, her inseam is 20 1/2 inches. I assessed them as ""somewhat small"" for the fit because my daughter is one of the shortest girl's in her class and we usually find that clothing is too long for her overall.

The navy and plaid are nice polyester with good drape that resists wrinkles. This polyester fit the plaid version is very thick, hot and gets kinked up easily. My daughter is constantly having to smooth it down because it gets all bunched up when she moves around.  Cute pattern but I wouldn’t buy it again"

The pattern is only slightly varied from uniform vendor; hardly noticeable if at all. The only problem I encountered was the length. These were about 2-3 inches below my daughters knee, so the fit was just too big. Waist has the adjusters which is great, but we tried two sizes and both far too long.

My best guess was to buy her an 18. It was too big. Bought a size 16 and it fit perfect. I measured both skirts to hopefully help anyone else trying to decide on these two sizes.Size 18 has a 36"" waist (with no ease) and is 23 3/4"" longSize 16 has a 33 1/2"" waist (with no ease) and is 23"" long"
1484,Pam VanKomen,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 8, 2018",Too big....update....,"Ordered a Big Girls size 18 for my 16 year old daughter who is 5’2” and 115 lbs.... it was HUGE. It could fit around 2 of her!!  It has an adjustable waist and even on the last notch, it was still too big!!  I have a Child size 16 from Walmart (it’s the Wonder Nation Brand) and it is a little tight on her so I thought I would order the Big Girls 18 of this French Toast brand.... I’m returning it for a Big Girls size 14 so hopefully that will work.  Other than the sizing, it’s a great skirt.UPDATE... so I ended up buying the girls 12 plus and it fit with a little less than an inch of extra room.  I’m going to keep it because there is an adjustable waist.  I also bought a size 9 juniors from the French Toast website (on sale for 9.99) and it is the exact same size as the girls 12 plus.  The only difference is that the Juniors size doesn’t have the adjustable waist.  For reference my daughter is a high school senior 5’3” and varies between 115 to 120lbs .  I hemmed the skirts myself because they are kinda long but it’s pretty easy to do, just watched a how to video."

My daughter is skinny but has very long legs -- so it's always been a challenge to find a size that would fit her. This skirt is perfect for her. She's 10 years old and she has this in size 10 and size 12. The length of size 10 is about 19.25"", while size 12 is about 21.25"".Here are the things I like the most about this skirt:1.) Price - it's way cheaper than buying it from the school's uniform supplier.2.) Length - I like that this skirt is long. The other skirts she had before, she outgrew them pretty quickly. Not with this one.3.) Adjustable Waist - since my daughter's waist is too small, having an adjustable waist elastic band is a great help. Now I don't have to get a smaller size which would sacrifice the length of the skirt.The fabric is thinner than the one we get at the school's uniform supplier (which was really a good fabric). It's not too bad for the price. I've seen similar skirts but different brand that are way thinner for almost the same price."

I got a size 16 in the skirt but it's still a bit big around the waist. It doesn't bother me too much though because I tightened it with the waist buttons. I should have gotten a size 14 instead but I'm not going to bother with returns. I am 5' 3.5"" and the length hits just below the knees."

It was great in the waist, roomy in hips. The skirt is a wind pant type material so there’s minimal stretch in the skirt itself.  It would be a great skirt for hot climates, such as mine (SC), that require uniforms. Unfortunately, my daughter’s school requires the skirt to hit middle of knee and these don’t, I’d argue they don’t really hit top of knee either. They were still a decent 2 inches from top of knee cap and my daughter is average height. I had to return all sizes and colors that I bought."

1571,Amazon Customer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 5, 2022",Smaller than expected,The shoes were much smaller than expected. I sized up and my son was still in pain with how small they were. I would have returned them if I had time prior to the event but unfortunately did not.
1572,JKB,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 5, 2021",skinny shoe!,This shoe was VERY narrow. He still has lots of room in the toe but the part by the laces until nearly the toe box is so skinny! We have to loosen them all the way until the shoelace is tiny in order to have them fit. We waited a few weeks to see if it would break in a bit but no. We can no longer use them. Our son is skinny and no where near the next size up in shoes to order. Very disappointed.
1573,Sunny Latrobe,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 29, 2021",Didn’t last long,"I had high hopes for these shoes. My son wears them daily for school but they aren’t the quality I had hoped for. After two weeks of wearing, this is what they looked like (pictures provided). This is while recess was inside and therefor no blacktop play. The black started to peel off the shoes. The shoelaces frayed and the seams are shaggy. The fit is good, which is nice. The presentation after ten days of wear is a problem. I wouldn’t recommend these shoes for daily wear. We are disappointed"

1577,GoodBuy,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 15, 2013",Cheap,"I needed dress shoes for a wedding. After reading other reviews, I thought this was a good buy. It wasn't...The shoes are super wide in the toe area, which is hard to see in the picture. My son takes a size three in shoes and these were thin and cheap feeling and not comfortable. They look good in the picture, but were ill-fitting in reality. Good thing I found a better pair at the store last minute as I had to wait almost two weeks to receive these (unusual for Amazon). Save your money, there are other 30$ shoes out there..."

1581,kls,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 13, 2019",Misleading Size Chart,"My son wears a size 3 little kids shoe, with a little room for growth (his toe rubs the end of a size 2).  So, I ordered the size 3M, which should be 8.5"" long, giving him a little room just like his other shoes.  The box says 3M, the inside of the shoe says 3M, but the shoe is 9.5"" long, which matches the size 6M big kids shoe according to the size chart.  These shoes are MUCH, MUCH bigger than his other size 3s.  The shoe looks to be of good quality and is decently priced, so we will hold on to the shoe in the hopes that he can wear it next year.  But it's frustrating that I now have to order another pair and hope that the size is correct when it arrives.  I'm going to try ordering one size down, but I feel like it's a guessing game because the size was so grossly incorrect.  Had the sizing not been so misleading, I would have given it more stars because it otherwise appears to be a good shoe.  I don't know if the size was misprinted or if there was a mistake in the manufacturing process, but this 3M little kids shoe is NOT a size 3M."
1582,MJB,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 2, 2021",One/Two Time Wear,"Our son wore these brand new to a wedding rehearsal and wedding. They looked awesome and they served their purpose.By the end of the weekend (about 7-8 hours total wear time between rehearsal and wedding), the toes were shredded.

1583,Kayla,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 20, 2018",Narrow shoe,"These are absolutely adorable. Unfortunately they are extremely narrow, to the point my lil guys foot couldn't get in even with the laces out.  They are true to size length wise(compared to his other shoes), so if your son has a very narrow foot you won't have any issues.  Very sad I had to return these.My baby is 13 months wears a size 5, ordered a 5. He is in the 99th percentile for height, so maybe that effects the width of his feet."

1585,Firefly,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2019",Difficult to get on,"I bought these for my son who is a size 6 in every shoe. Unfortunately, I had to cut the tongue of the shoe to get his foot in.. it took me about 15 minutes to get them on him. If your child has any arch in their foot be aware that you may have to do the same. Once they were on they looked adorable."

I bought them for the great ratings.. but they were very tough to get on my son's feet.. and he complained of them hurting his feet, even though his toes didn't reach the end of the shoes.. He had to wear them b/c he was in my sisters wedding.. and i could barely convince him to put them back on for the wedding.. the only thing that would convince him was that he could put his regular shoes back on as soon as we were done with the ceremony..the only good things about the shoe, was the low price & they look nice.. but thats about it.."

I was disappointed when I had to return a size 7 which was too small. There is no size 8. Oh well, looks like I have to spend more $ for men’s dress shoes which are 2x’s more than bot’s shoes.

1593,ShopinMom,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 4, 2017","Very nice shoe for the price, but stiff","Great value. My 7 year old LOVES these ""big boy"" shoes as he call them.  From my perspective, they are a great value and look very nice (not too bulky).  However, they are not very soft (my son has only worn them twice and has not complained about this, but I noticed it right away and worried they may be too stiff and hurt his feet after a while). That's to be expected when not buying real leather. They run a tad large (long, not wide), but he can grow into them."

They are super hard for me to get his feet into though.  They don't stretch or open up from top to bottom very much so we have to shove them on to get my son's feet in them.

1602,$Hegemony,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 26, 2016",Great QUALITY,"Wedding shoes, fit as expected. My son liked this, I can offer advice. measure both of your little one’s feet before buying toddler shoes (if there’s a big difference between feet, aim to fit the larger size). Toddler’s feet can vary by as much as a half size. Keep in mind, too, that kids’ feet grow quickly, so you should re-measure your pup’s paws every two or three months to account for toddler growth.Bring her to her feet. Your child should be standing while being measured for shoes. Keep an eye on her toes: Tots tend to curl theirs under, but that will throw off the measurement.Put a sock in it. Your child’s shoe, that is. When he tries on shoes, he should have on the same type of socks he’ll likely wear with the shoes. This way you’ll get the fit just right.Stick out your thumb, and use it to make sure your little one’s big toe isn’t bumping up against the inside of the shoe. The best shoes for toddlers should allow for a thumb’s width (about half an inch) between her toe and the tip of the shoe.If the shoe fits, buy it in that size. When buying toddler shoes, don’t be tempted to go a little larger to try to get a few extra months of wear out of it. Too-big shoes are hard to walk in and could even be unsafe. If one foot is markedly bigger than the other, however, buy to fit the larger one.Check that heel. Watch your toddler walk in the shoe and hone in on the back of the shoe. If it looks loose or slips up and down, the friction could lead to blisters.Buck the trends. Pointy boots, clogs, and other high-fashion footwear may be adorable, but they aren't the best shoes for toddlers who are still learning to walk — they won’t provide the support and stability a newbie needs.Mind the material. Even when you have your eye out for toddler sandals, look for a shoe made of canvas, cloth, or leather (rather than rubber or plastic), all of which are porous and allow air to circulate in and out, and also are flexible. You should be able to bend a toddler’s shoe in your hand without much effort.Get in the groove. Steer clear of treads that are smooth and slick, so a wobbly tot is less likely to slip and slide. Likewise, avoid shoe soles with deep grooves that could easily “catch” on the edge of a rug or sidewalk and trip up your tyke. And the same goes for the leopard-skin pointy or hipster motorcycle boots. Your shoe fetish must stay in your own closet (for now anyway). Toddler shoes are there to support and stabilize new walkers. Barefoot is best, but when outdoors — think function over fashion. Or, give them both. Mmm… that’s a no-brainer. Remember: If your kid starts screaming, it may not be the shoe. It may just be naptime! So, congratulate yourself on surviving the crowded (non-virtual) department store with a toddler and head out. Why yes, you deserve that glass of wine waiting for you at home.One size fits today. As tempting as it might be, don’t buy bigger shoes for the months ahead. Shoes that are too big are hard to walk in and can cause falling and tripping (i.e., drunken sailors on the loose). I get this to my neighbors afterwards."

He ran and played in them and I only took them off once it was time to get him off to bed. I wish his feet didn't grow so fast because I'd love to be able to use them a few more times.____________How do I rate the items I bought?Every product that I bought starts at 3 Stars and gets subtractions oradditions as we go depending on how well it performs according to myexpectation and whether the item perform as advertised.

My sister was getting married and wanted my son in her wedding as ""head of ring security"". Does it get any cuter than that?! I lost a lot of sleep thinking about all of the ways my tactile sensitive 4 year old could go rogue while walking down the aisle. Would he tear off his itchy suit? Would he yell about his wedgie mid aisle? Would he throw his shoes in the fountain? SO many possibilities. I took a gamble after reading some of the reviews on these shoes and they were absolutely perfect. Cute as a button he was and he wore the shoes the entire day without a single complaint. I found an awesome suit on amazon to go with it and he looked like a million bucks without the million buck price tag. These shoes saved us from many possible disasters!"

 Me encanto la calidad, estaba indecisa si comprar o no por las reseñas.. Que bueno que lo pedí porque es tal cual como lo quería para mi hija; y se me hace difícil encontrar pantalones de uniforme ajustados así! Mi hija tiene 5 años pero es un poco grande para su edad, (pesa 55 Ib) le pedí talla 7 y le quedó perfecto en la cintura, un poco largo pero eso es lo de menos. Estiran y a ella le encantaron por la tela que es suave. 🥰"
