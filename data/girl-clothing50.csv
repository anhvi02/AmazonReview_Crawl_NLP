0,carla w.,1.0,the United States ,"March 23, 2022",Missing,I only received 6 pair not 12 the photo shows 12 pairs I’d like a replacement please
1,mamma3,1.0,the United States ,"January 22, 2013",Hane's Red Label Crew socks,"I really don't like to write bad reviews but these socks are really not good.  They are white and cushion-y but they have very little shape.  They do not hug the feet.  They fall down and bunk inside boots.  My daughter won't even wear them.  (I bought the same sock for my son (Green Label Crew) in a different size and they are exactly as terrible as the ""girls"").  I am not usually disappointed in any Hanes products but these are definitely not acceptable."
2,DinaZ,1.0,the United States ,"July 3, 2013",No shape to these socks,"They were actually very funny as the shape was balloon-like at the bottom of the tube ankle part.There was no way these socks would fit, keep a sock shape or fit inside a shoe.We threw them out. Not even good enough for sock monkeys."
3,bronx girl,1.0,the United States ,"July 7, 2014",tears quickly,These sock tore at the top area quickly. I would not recommend them.
4,Summer,2.0,the United States ,"July 6, 2022",Terrible,"These feel like polyester and washed terribly. Pills and pulls all over, following the first wear/wash. Sent them back for a refund."
5,47states,2.0,the United States ,"April 4, 2018",Not as pictured - half had colored toes,The socks were okay but I bought these for a boy and the socks that arrived were half white and the other half had colored toes. My brother is handicapped and only likes white Hanes without the grey heel so I thought these would be perfect but they mis-represented them (or sent the wrong ones).
6,Cassie Richardson,3.0,the United States ,"September 19, 2022",Nice socks but triple check your sizing,"*Above pictures show a women’s size medium sock for comparison.Second picture shows a boys size large on the left (same brand) and a girls size medium on the right (two different brands)*My 7 year old daughter wears a girls medium in any other sock. She’s growing out of them so we bought a girls size large. I guess I’m to blame for not checking the sizing, but a girls large ranges from size 4-10??? I only wear a size 7. They should be labeled as one size fits all ages 13+ with that size range, or at least as women’s sized, not child sized. Not at all what I was trying to order.They seem like comfortable enough socks, I didn’t need more socks but I guess I have more socks now and still have to order more for my daughter. They also took forever to be delivered. Not very happy about my order."
7,Kerry G.,3.0,the United States ,"April 20, 2022",Way too large!,Maybe I wasn’t understanding the sizing but I bought these for my 5 year old and they are huge!! She wears a children’s size 10 shoe. I returned them.  This was disappointing because the quality and value for the price seemed excellent. The size was the only reason why I gave this 3 stars overall. Otherwise I would’ve rated them higher. I can’t comment on how they hold up in the wash.
8,Anne,3.0,the United States ,"January 5, 2021",Pilled up after one wash.,"Nice socks, until the first wash. Daughter liked them, but after one wash they are all pilled up, nasty looking! Not sure what the deal is, but all the Hane's socks I got her did this (purchased a few different styles from different retailers). They were to replace all of her FOTL socks, which had all pilled up (over time)."
9,Kendra H.,3.0,the United States ,"November 1, 2014",They are not bad but they are wide not that stretchy or tight,They are not bad but they are wide not that stretchy or tight. I would consider them around the house socks but my daughter could care less. I know they gather in her shoes...but it doesn't bother her.
10,alexisf514,3.0,the United States ,"May 22, 2013",Too large,"Socks are of good quality but they do not fit snugly around the foot, The length is not the problem, but they are very wide, at least for my granddaughters who are on the thin side."
11,Kim Wright,4.0,the United States ,"November 27, 2022",Great for kids,Bought for my granddaughter and no complaints so far!
12,Joshi's,4.0,the United States ,"April 18, 2022",Fits,"These are good for the price. I wasn't expecting much because lets agree, none of the socks hold up for school kids.  These have so far.  they are super soft and has not shrinked.  The colors are vibrant and has literally every color to match all outfits."
13,E. Greene,4.0,the United States ,"May 29, 2022",Cute and comfy,Perfect for the kid...she loves them...she wears a size 3 at 7 y/o..
14,Vincent Morris,4.0,the United States ,"February 16, 2022",Kid wears size 2 shoes needs medium socks,The size chart is worthless... My 5 year old needs mediums instead of these large we ordered
15,TMB,4.0,the United States ,"March 3, 2014",sock sizing is confusing!,"I have always been baffled by the way socks are sized. I bought these for my daughter who is 9 and wears a size 4 shoe.  These are to fit size 4-10. While I was fully aware that these would be big in order to fit up to size 10, they were far bigger than I imagined.  They fit me and I wear a 9.  But they are soft and fit well and don't slouch around the ankles. I've washed them a few times and they are holding up well, which I expect from Hanes. I would recommend for durability and comfort but would caution on the fit and suggest these for anyone wearing a size 6-10. Anything smaller than that should go with the medium."
16,Roser,4.0,the United States ,"January 2, 2015",Good socks,These are good socks.  Not as thick as I thought they'd be but they do the job.  They are not thin..
17,Ashlie,4.0,the United States ,"March 18, 2013",Plain socks,"Plain, white socks that are perfectly fine for my 4 year old girl. They aren't too thick so she can wear them with any shoe style, which I like."
18,Romantic,4.0,the United States ,"May 5, 2013",comfy,"Love 'em. Great price, great fit. Very comfortable to wear. I bought these and other socks for me and my girls, and all of us prefer wearing these by far."

20,Stephanie Lerro,4.0,the United States ,"December 15, 2022","The socks, have a good fit, look nice, and what’s good as they came with multiple pairs of them.",The socks seem pretty good or true to size. What we like about it the most is that there’s multiple pairs of them and the color seem pretty good. Plus they fit pretty well for my daughter.

22,Bre B,5.0,the United States ,"November 22, 2022",Great quality,"These are great socks for my 4 year old. We've tried different brands that are not as great quality, don't last long, or feel too thin. These are thick, but not too thick. Comfy and easy for her to put on and off herself."

29,Laura Sprague,5.0,the United States ,"November 10, 2022",Great deal,Good quality and good number of socks for the price
30,Mathew,5.0,the United States ,"October 18, 2022",Nice socks,"Perfect for my 6 year old girl. They have the right amount of fun with all the colors, while still allowing her to feel like she has socks ""for big girls"". They are so comfy and fit her perfectly; no problems with holes or threading. Would definitely buy again."
31,shinobi,1.0,the United States ,"July 26, 2022",Sizes are off,Size XL is a 10. Most XLs in children’s clothes are 12/14. There isn’t a reliable size chart available and it makes purchasing very difficult.
32,Robert Hallow Knight,1.0,the United States ,"February 4, 2021",Poor Quality !,I purchased these snow pants for my 7 year old granddaughter and the crotch seam split on the third use.  It doesn’t appear to have been completely sewn together just tacked together. If you zoom in on the photo you can see only the threads where the seam was tacked together every couple of inches.  So I would rate them poor in terms of durability and quality.
33,Goldencurls90,1.0,the United States ,"December 31, 2021",115lbs 5’3,Ummmmm these are not true to size AT ALL I prefer pink in M I am def a xs s but I wanted room. Um no I had to give these to a CHILD I weigh 115 and am 5’3 so like yeah
34,Darcy,1.0,the United States ,"January 29, 2021",They rip,"I bought my daughter the rainbow pair last year, I washed them and the whole crotch part ripped open. I thought well, they are a year old, no big deal.  A few weeks ago I bought the red pair, lesson learned!  She came home from school yesterday and this red pair ripped in the same spot!"
35,Amazon Customer,1.0,the United States ,"February 26, 2021",Zipper broke during first wear,Zipper broke after the first wear. Quality is okay - but without a zipper they aren’t helpful! Now too late to return so we will end up spending more than the pants cost to replace the zipper. I may just invest in a better branded pair!
36,Shannon Hoffman,1.0,the United States ,"January 21, 2021",My Daughter was soaked!!!,If I could give these 0 stars I would. My daughter wore these 1 time for about 15 minutes and came in completely soaked. They are not water/ snow resistant or waterproof at all! Maybe we just got a bad pair but I was very disappointed.
37,Rakhee Sonthalia,1.0,the United States ,"January 2, 2021",Didn’t even last 2 hours,Stitch cake off on one leg after an hour of wearing. We then had to head to a store and buy a replacement. I would not buy this again.
38,Teddy Barbeau,1.0,the United States ,"March 10, 2021",poor fit,The fit is not great. the outer leg fabric was constantly rolling up from the inner lining. Would not recommend or buy again.

43,JA,2.0,the United States ,"February 22, 2021",Cheap Zipper,My daughter wore this about 3 times in Colorado.  The zipper seems to be plastic and one of the teeth were messed up so the zipper wouldn't stay closed it kept splitting open.
44,Kianna Jensen,2.0,the United States ,"March 7, 2021",Ripped within 6 weeks,Knee ripped within the first 6 weeks of use. Otherwise they were awesome. Just bummed that they didnt last longer
45,Thelma Ireton,2.0,Canada ,"January 25, 2020",,"My daughter loved these snow pants from the moment she got them. Unfortunately, we've only had them for close to three months and they are starting to tear where the straps attach to the bib at the back. Soon enough they will be fully ripped and no longer work. For $37.00 snow pants this is unacceptable.Amazon- Please provide a contact email address so we can speak further about a replacement pair."
46,Sara,2.0,Canada ,"December 29, 2020",,Bought these for my daughter but they were too small. Very well made but runs too small

48,J B,3.0,the United States ,"December 14, 2022",Torn cuff,"Snow pants cost about $20 with discount, but is it really a good deal when product arrives defective? Besides torn cuff, pants seemed nice. Who knows what will tear next though. Returned."
49,tessa,3.0,the United States ,"August 27, 2022",Fit wide,I purchased these for back up for my children. Good for the money however the fit is wide. Fit more like a hefty size than standard.
50,Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States ,"January 17, 2022","Fits well, comfortable but not water resistant",My daughter liked the feel of it but it did not keep her warm or dry. The suit got wet very quickly making her very cold very fast. Made it hard to enjoying playing in the first snow of the year. Will not buy again.
51,stacy,3.0,the United States ,"April 2, 2022",Not made for thick girls,Was tight for the size
52,lakegirl,3.0,the United States ,"January 12, 2021",Covered in cat hair,"The bibs were just as I expected, except they were covered in cat hair!!!! Considered returning them, but since they are only going to be used to play in, I will just wash them. I’m guessing they were returned at some point. They should definitely check theirs returns, because is someone was allergic, it could cause a serious problem!!"
53,Erica,3.0,the United States ,"March 14, 2021","Good snow pants, almost great",Great snow pants but already have to repair them. We use them a lot but after about 4 uses I noticed a seam that already needs repair. They do the job well but wished I didn't have to mend them already.
54,KIMBERLEE,3.0,the United States ,"December 30, 2020",Too small!,3 stars because the fit is not accurate but the overall quality and fabric is great for the price. I ordered these for my 10 year old and they fit my 6 year old.
55,7185,3.0,the United States ,"February 28, 2021",Looks like use,Product arrived with no tag and dirty looks like if it was use.  I returned
56,Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States ,"March 9, 2021",Didn't last long,Sadly these lasted 2 1/2 months before they started ripping apart in the crotch:(
57,Daniel J MacArthur,3.0,the United States ,"December 6, 2019",Very Long,I order the medium which is a 7/8. These are very long. Even with the straps set to the smallest setting. We will keep and just hem up the bottom. Should get several seasons out of them
58,DeadpanAnn,4.0,the United States ,"December 14, 2022",Perfect for playing in the snow,"We don't do winter sports, but I wanted my kids to be able to play in the snow for longer than 10 minutes. These seem excellent quality for the price and should do the job. They wouldn't be great for winter sports, but when you have a warm house to step right into and comfies to slip inti they'll work. Good enough to skip forking out the BIG $$$ for gear they'll wear 3x, then outgrow."
59,John,4.0,the United States ,"December 10, 2022",Quality made for memories,Recently moved to Western NY. Bought these for my 5 year old daughter she played outside for about 45 minutes before her nose got cold. She never mentioned anything was cold but her nose. Her pants under these were completely dry except a little around her boots. My fault not the snow pants fault
60,Brandilyn Fry,4.0,the United States ,"February 1, 2022",Runs a little small,"Bought an XXL for my child that wears a 14/16 and it fit, but won't last us past this snow season.  I would recommend a size up."
61,Erin,4.0,the United States ,"January 10, 2022","runs large, great for price","I had meant to order my son a 3T, but accidentally ordered 2T. It worked out perfectly as the bib runs large. We live in Florida and needed a bib for a trip to NY. Definitely worth $20."
62,Shaun M. Davis,4.0,the United States ,"November 24, 2019",Better quality and features than expected.,"We have not had a chance to test these in action in the snow but from what I’ve seen so far these are among the better pair of snow-bibs I’ve seen, having shopped around a lot in stores. The seat and knees reinforcement are decent but, again, not sure yet how they will hold up in actual use. Zipper pockets are nice, adjustable shoulder and waste straps are nice. There’s a ring which I presume to be for hooking gloves on, which I like as a much hetter option to store gloves when not in use. We ordered purple and pink and the colors are great - the girls both love them in terms of appearance and feel/fit, not that appearance is important especially with snow-bibs. All-in-all I was pleasantly surprised with these, as Amazon name branded attire is new to us and the price point created doubt in what I would get. Not 5 stars because we haven't tested true quality in withstanding kids playing in snow."
63,Kelly H.,4.0,the United States ,"January 28, 2021",True to sizing,My daughter has only gotten to wear them once so far since we received them and they fit as expected and kept her warm and dry.  I would say only issue was the length of time it took to get them.
64,Shopper8,4.0,the United States ,"April 20, 2021",Good buy,These are surprisingly good quality at an affordable price. Room to grow for my 6 YO and a cute pattern.
65,Viktor Vaughn,4.0,the United States ,"December 10, 2019",Big zipper in the middle makes it easier to get ON/OFF,"big zipper in the middle makes it easier to get on and off.  Comfortable material inside and water-resistant outside.  Played in the snow and went sledding...would buy again, but they do run a bit big...not enough to order a smaller size, they will grow into it.  I expect these to last a few years of snow play."
66,Jessica Buxton,4.0,the United States ,"December 3, 2020",Fits true to siZe,This arrived the wrong color. I ordered the navy with light pink fabric on the inside but recieved the neon yellow.
67,Chris,4.0,the United States ,"December 30, 2020",Warm and dry toddler,Can’t beat these for the prices. They keep my toddler warm out in the snow and dry.
68,Bob,5.0,the United States ,"December 13, 2022",Good Quality.,I am so happy with the quality of the fabric. It was extremely soft on the inside and the fit was just right for my daughter. The pattern was identical to the photo as well. Very happy with the purchase.
69,Elia,5.0,the United States ,"December 9, 2022",Really nice snow bibs,"Fit is perfect, quality is really good."
70,Dbee,5.0,the United States ,"November 22, 2022",Very worthy for montana winter,"Water resistant. Great strong quality material. 6yr old approved. We went up a size as per reviews. They are BIG. Keeping tho, they keep the kid warm in 15 and below Temps in a breezy town in Montana."
71,Kbetker,5.0,the United States ,"August 6, 2022",Perfect for the price,"Very happy I got this on deal, perfect for my growing girl to be prepared for snow."
72,Elizabeth,5.0,the United States ,"March 20, 2020",Great Quality for the Price,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of these snowpants.  I got them for my almost 6 year old.  She's starting to grow out of size 5 and wears smaller size 6's so I got a SMALL (which the size chart says is equivalent to size 6-7).  They are a bit big, as I expected they would be, but they should fit great next year.  She's already worn them outside in the snow this year and we just roll the bottoms up once and adjusted the straps as small as we can and they were fine. They are quite wide in the legs, but they're still fine even on my stringbean of a kid.  They are very thick and warm and will be great for our super snowy and cold winters here in Tahoe.UPDATE 1/2021 - These are some of the best snow pants I've found. We've had them for almost 2 years now. We live in Tahoe where we have snow on the ground 5-6 months of the year and she has worn these pants A LOT. They have held up, have no tears or rips, and will still probably fit her for another year. These are definitely the best deal I've found on pants that last and hold up for a long time. We've bought more expensive pants in the past that have not held up as long as these $30ish ones have. Definitely recommend and would give 10 stars if I could."
73,Professorowl,5.0,the United States ,"December 19, 2019",These are great snow pants!,"These are great snow pants! Since we live in an area where it's snowy and cold in the winter, my daughter is used to wearing snow pants every late fall/winter/spring. We've bought different brands over the years. Last year, she had Columbia snow pants, but she outgrew them. Since these pants were less expensive, I thought she could give them a go. I'm so glad I bought them. This late fall/early winter weather has been colder and snowier than usual. She has worn them multiple times, including at our town's outdoor ice skating rink. My daughter said they keep her warm, dry, and she can move well in them. They also was well, dry quickly, and the fabric seems quite durable. The elastic cuffs at the ankles work very well to keep the snow out instead of soaking the bottom part her leggings on the inside (like most of her other snow pants did). These snow pants work much better than any of the other snow pants she has owned over the years, including the Columbia brand. They fit just a bit bigger than usual, so I'm hoping she might be able to get two seasons out of them instead of just one. I highly recommend these pants, especially for active, snow-loving kiddos."
74,Sara Pote,5.0,the United States ,"January 21, 2022",Good quality,"I bought this for my daughter who is a tall and slender 4.5 year old. I wanted it big so we can use it for two years and this is perfect! The Velcro tabs on the sides allowed me to fit it to her size so there are no gaps which was perfect (and were  not on the other brand I ordered). Seems like it will be durable. My daughter was quite warm when she wore it. Overall, I’m satisfied and would buy it again."
75,Tina G,5.0,the United States ,"February 19, 2021","Amazing Snow-pant/bibs! Warm, dry, durable!","She said they keep her warm and her legs are never cold! Also, snow doesn’t go up her coat onto her stomach because they are bibs. She loves the two pockets and the loops for mittens and she said that the straps over her shoulders don’t bother her at all. I really like the extra fabric on the knees and on  the backside; the regular fabric on these durable  but when you add two layers, it works especially well and I think the extra layers on the knees and the backside really help to keep her dry because that’s mainly what she’s doing... sitting or kneeling.We priced a lot of snow bibs, especially looking at Lands’ End and L.L. Bean. We ended up with these  because I’d the price point but, in the end, I think they were the best choice!!"
76,Mike S,5.0,the United States ,"December 14, 2019","Warm, quality, inexpensive!","So we bought these out of desperation, once we learned the snowsuit we had for my daughter was too large for an upcoming trip to see family in Northern Minnesota.  It turns out this was a a GREAT purchase!  My daughter just turned 4 and we bought the 4T size in pink.  They are a bit big even when adjusted to be as tight as possible.  That said, I don't regret the purchase as I really think these will fit next season.  At $15 per year, I think these are a phenomenal deal.  We are from Southern California, used to a low of 45 in the depths of winter.  My daughter spent several hours climbing through snow berms in 18 degree weather with utterly no complaints of being cold.  I was really skeptical that the Amazon Basics brand, as I had no prior experience.  However, the quality of the materials and stitching seems on par with any major brand, and the warmth is plenty adequate.  Homerun!"
77,G. V.,5.0,the United States ,"February 9, 2020",Warm and Dry,"I bought this for my two and a half year old - her preschool class goes outside to play everyday, and only stays inside if it's really, really cold.  It seems to keep her comfortable and happy when she's on the playground.  Her teachers take photos of the kids and put them on an app so parents can see what they do throughout the day, and kiddo always seems to be having a blast outside when I review the pics - so she certainly can't be very cold when she's running around during our New England winter.  Her clothes aren't wet when I pick her up at the end of the day, so it also seems to keep her dry in the snow.It runs large on her, but she's a tiny kid - so I'd say that it's true to size.The price was great too, so overall I'm happy with my purchase.  My daughter certainly seems happy with it, too!"
78,Kristi,1.0,the United States ,"November 7, 2022",Cheap!!! Hole ripped in first 2 minutes!!!,My daughter is 7. I got these for her to wear around the house as play clothes. As she was putting them on for the first time a giant hole ripped in the seam in the butt of the pants!!! Waste of money!!! I was going to order more in different colors but I will go elsewhere! You get what you pay for but she never even got to wear these!!! I will say that she has had other children's place leggings in the past and they lasted her awhile. Idk if they switched to cheaper materials or this was just a fluke or what but I'm so disappointed!!
79,Angie,1.0,the United States ,"December 7, 2022",Cheap material- holes began forming after only hours of wear,"My son is in ballet. He went to class and by the time we were home, multiple small holes had began to form in the leggings. He literally only danced in these."

86,Anna M,1.0,the United States ,"February 21, 2020",These leggings are too skinny and they bulge in the wrong places,"I bought a size 8 for my 8 year old and promptly returned them as they were so skinny she couldn't even get them on comfortably. I bought a size 10 which i have kept BUT the first time she put them on I thought they were back to front as there was a bulge at the front. Nope they are just made like that. it was a 2 pack so I saw that both pairs were the same. I kept them only because she needed them for school uniform and i had to return the smaller ones already and thought her skirt will be over them anyway so no big deal. The thing is, she wears black leggings on the weekend too and every time she puts these leggings on I see that hideous bulge and have to stop myself from asking if they are back to front.

I bought her a 4 in these and she has to wiggle to get them on and when she bends over her rear is exposed. They fit like a carters size 2T.I got myself matching size girls 16 and I’m in the same boat as her. 16 in girls should be more than adequate for me. I’d go up two sizes in the denim since it has very little stretch. I can’t speak for the other colors.

I keep buying them because I absolutely love the way they fit my daughter. Unfortunately, after about five washings the leggings get a small hole in the same exact area of all pants. Quality control needs to take notice, there’s definitely a manufacturing flaw. If you’re looking for a great fitting disposable legging, these are it. Unfortunately they are not going to last too long. I keep buying because of the price point and fit knowing they’re short-term but I just wanted to make buyers beware…"

Really stinks because my daughter is potty training and is really excited about different prints but she got excited just to open it and see the same underwear she already has. From a mother who's trying everything to keep her toddler engaged and excited about potty training, thanks a lot. I'd return but the point was to get more underwear for accidents, we expected to have these in time to for her to start her week at daycare so returning would be insult to injury."

With these, they are so big in her waist & SUPER tight on her legs! I will add that she is a small toddler, so about 28 pounds with long, skinny legs!

We picked these out together, that she wanted to wear, and anxiously awaited the arrival of her new unicorn underwear. Instead we received what look like llamas.

I bought the pack with 4 styles for her, 3 being designed and the others were plain colors. She was really excited for her new flower panties and we received two packs of panties with two designs: assorted plain colors , and one pattern : zebras with flowers.My daughter is fussy and doesn't like these, but I have a niece who can use them.

I assumed it would have pockets as most all do for this age group, and did not look closely enough. That is on me, and my daughter likes it anyway, so we are keeping it. If it would have had pockets, I’d have given it five stars.For reference, at this time, my daughter is about a half inch shy of being five feet tall and weighs 85 lbs. She is very tall for her age, 99th percentile, but proportionally for her weight has a very average body build to ever so slightly thin. We got the size 16 and she has room to grow. She is in elementary school and has a child’s body shape still versus a budding young lady’s body shape, though I think a young lady in early puberty would have chest room still."

I ended up ordering the 5/6 from the actual store and it fits perfectly.  I’ll keep this one because she’ll grow into it eventually.  It’s a lightweight denim and good to wear over a dress on a cool (not cold) night.  The quality is good and durable.  Pockets are just for show.

It is nowhere near as cute as the underwear in the picture, and I won't be keeping either package. I've seen other comments from people saying that maybe they should have known they might receive a different product, since the listing says ""assorted.""

292,Toney,2.0,the United States ,"April 26, 2022",Not warm,"We were expecting a little bit a thicker coat. This was so thin my daughter never wore it because it didn’t warm her at all. Sure, maybe it would have kept rain out, but you would still freeze to death. So you’d be dry and dead."
293,Sara D.,2.0,the United States ,"April 13, 2022",Very thin and easily torn,This is a jacket. It is not very thick and the material is so thin that it tore very easily when my daughter was putting the jacket on. The design is cute but it’s not worth the cost.

295,Kindle Customer,2.0,the United States ,"October 17, 2021",Sizing is way off....,"Bought an XL for my 9 year old daughter, who normally wears size 10 to 12 in girls.  XL was skintight, would have had to go up to XXL to fit.  Plus, the fit was weird, arms too long and skinny, overall length too long for a jacket.  Would not buy again."
296,Dama Hickey,2.0,the United States ,"December 10, 2021",Disappointed,Love the color but was really disappointed that it had a another kids name already wrote in the jacket so if was obviously used. Sent back to Amazon.

302,Heather Miller,3.0,the United States ,"February 15, 2022",Super cute but super small,"Look, my daughter is a bit big for her age (7) but typically wears size 10/12 shirts.  The Large jacket was barely zippable and the XL was not even 1 inch wider than the L.  No idea how the XL could fit most 14 year olds I see.  This is soooo cute and well made but why do all little girls clothes have to be so slim cut, what is this telling them!? I got a similar Gap kids down jacket in size M and it's perfect with room.  Come on Amazon, disappointed."
303,Kristin F,3.0,the United States ,"March 10, 2022","Cute, but sized poorly","We have purchased several of these coats over the last few years for our 3 toddlers, however this one while just as cute seemed to be sized weird. The arms were way too short. Had to return."

305,Rich,3.0,the United States ,"August 28, 2021",Too small for stated size,Very small for the size range that it says it's for. I have 2 girls 8 and 9 one is a string bean and the other one pretty average. Size 10 and 12 respectively. I bought two of them and they are both kinda small . I ever ordered the next size up in hopes that it would fit them for more than one season. No luck. It will fit for 2 months and then in the hand me down bin they go.
306,Anime Nut,3.0,the United States ,"December 31, 2021",Not an xxl,It barely fits my daughter at an XXL.  The sleeves are long enough but it's tight on her when I zip it up.

More suited as a spring jacket. Will not withstand Chicago's fall and winter weather.I will return this.
308,NLM4501,4.0,the United States ,"December 7, 2022",Jacket runs small,Received the jacket today for my 8 year old granddaughter and  tried it on immediately.  Very tight fit and would not be able to zip if she had on a sweater or sweatshirt underneath.  I had read several reviews that said it ran small but decided a large would be safe for an 8 year old.  She is wearing 10 if individually sized but I do buy 10/12 if that sizing is available.  Usually works fine but this time it didn't.  The quality seemed nice and is exactly what I was looking for for our usually mild North Carolina winters.  Have started my return an exchange for an X Large.  If a little big that's OK so we can possibly get longer use out of it.  Saw some comments on quality but keep in mind this is a $20 item not an Eddie Bauer packable down jacket for a lot more $$$$$  As a reference my granddaughter is 67.6 lbs and 4ft 3-1/4 inches tall and this jacket was definitely too small.  Arm length ok but tight across shoulders .

311,Shannon McGhee,4.0,the United States ,"January 9, 2022","Smaller, slimmer, shorter arms than expected","I purchased this jacket as a ski jacket for my granddaughter who is a slim 10-12. I ordered a size large. The jacket fit snuggly with a bulky sweatshirt underneath.  If I could change anything about this jacket, the arms would be 2 inches longer and the jacket length would be 2 inches longer and the sides would be a little less fitted. My granddaughter wore the jacket skiing with a long sleeve shirt and a sweatshirt underneath and she was plenty warm. I had to be careful not to pull the sleeves of her shirt and sweatshirt down past the wrist of the jacket or they would have been very wet from the snow."
312,Amazon Customer,4.0,the United States ,"May 13, 2022",Lightweight Jacket,I really like this jacket but it ran a bit small.
313,Lindsey,4.0,the United States ,"November 20, 2021","Runs very small, size up two!","Adorable jacket.  I ordered two for my girls but of course they were both too small, luckily I was able to keep one and switch the smallest for a bigger biggest size because Amazon did me dirty and charged me for a price change since the coats were on sale when I bought them, even though they had the sizing wrong online, and all I was trying to do was exchange sizing.  So they jackets run very small, I sized up two for my girls, but they're an adorable light weight jacket."
314,April Funk,4.0,the United States ,"April 7, 2022",Lightweight great fit,"Light weight warmth adaptable coat. Pretty color and nice fit. Zipper is tricky for both kids, but feel like they will adjust to it."
315,Amazon Customer,4.0,the United States ,"December 7, 2021",Cute but on the smaller side,I bought the large for my almost 9 year old daughter and it just barely fits. I bought a medium in the boys’ version of the same jacket for my 6 1/2 year old boy and it’s slightly bigger than the girls large. My son is swimming in it. So the girls jackets are on the small side and the boys are large. Other than that these jackets are cute and warm. They look nice!
316,sj,4.0,the United States ,"December 19, 2021",Super Cute but very small across chest,"This item is so cute, bought for my 2 kiddos. Read the reviews so I sized up.

I will return and repurchase :)"
317,Kimberly Murphy,4.0,the United States ,"October 21, 2021",Great jacket,"Jacket is just as described. Great for that transitional weather of fall and spring. There is no fleece, which is what I preferred. My 5 year is around wears a size 5 and if fit her. I ordered a small to give her room to wear it again in the spring and maybe next Fall. It fits well without looking too big"
318,Mandi,5.0,the United States ,"December 5, 2022",Great Jacket,"I bought this jacket for my 8 1/2 year old. The large fits her well, a little big but not too big. I was afraid that the medium would be too small and I think I was right.  This jacket feels very thin but with it being a puffer jacket I’m sure it will be plenty warm. I wasn’t looking for a snow coat and we live in the south.  The navy flower pattern is so cute in person. My daughter is very happy."
319,Kali G.,5.0,the United States ,"November 28, 2022",Amazon brands = amazing!,"I have always loved buying Amazon brands for smaller household items but took a risk buying my first clothing item made by Amazon and needless to say I am blown away by the quality. My toddler loves this jacket, lightweight yet warm enough for Alabama winters. The little hood is kind of rounded in so it stays on her head without constantly sliding off as well as keeps the cold out. Definitely recommend!!"
320,Justin Core,5.0,the United States ,"December 5, 2022",Perfect layering jacket,My daughter goes to an outdoor school so she needs layers.

I was so upset because it was so cute and we hadn't even gotten her to wear it yet! The pants were used with different shirts, so it was not a complete loss... but just a word of advice is to buy the set bigger so you have a little more time on the dinosaur shirt."

The 4T here barely fits her and is the same size as some of her 3T shirts if I hold them up beside each other.  She’ll probably only be able to wear it for a couple of months.

My little girl is 11 months and already this sweater is snug. The other shirt fits generously but the sweater not so much. The pants/leggings fit as expected. Overall I still love this set. Just wish the sweater was bigger by even a smidge.

The blouse is not sheer and the material is soft and great quality for both tops. The blouse has snaps up the back for easy on/off. My toddler is just shy of 3, and wears a 3 or 4T depending on the brand. I ordered the 4T and it was huge, so I would say this is very true to size. 3T fit is perfect with room up grow. The Simple Joys by Carter’s brand I find to be much more true to size than the Carter’s store, at Carter’s store she wears a 4T top because they run small/short. It was packaged nicely with a Carter’s advertisement card inside of a sealed plastic bag, like a little package. This set would make a really nice gift!"

The issue is that she has worn it for about a month and it has already ripped in 2 places on the inside and the stuffing started coming out.  I am going to try to sew it and hopefully it works, but I don't feel I should be doing this at a month old. I'm not sure why this happened, as she hasn't really played outside with this jacket...more of just to go in/out of the house, school, etc....so I can't blame it on rough play.  I'm just a little upset that I may have to go out and buy another winter coat."

464,Sheena,2.0,the United States ,"October 22, 2020",Not Winter Weight-- Runs Small,"I was disappointed with this coat because it is not winter weight.  In the mid-west, it would be considered more of a fall jacket.  Also my daughter is 10 and weighs about 70 pounds.  She usually wears a Large, which is the size ordered.  It fits, but it will be tight with layers under it.  (And we definitely have to layer because it is not very warm).  For $90 bucks I expected better, especially from Columbia."
465,Cannon23,2.0,the United States ,"January 24, 2021",Good coat if you know how to sow.,The coat is nice except for the fact it comes apart easily.

I would not purchase again or recommend to someone.

I loved the quality of the past Columbia coats we have purchased for her and have passed down to her younger sister. This coat however, a child's coat, has super thin material that has torn on the sleeves after on week of wearing it to school. My daughter is in half day kindergarten, so that means she might have one 15 minute recess a day. How has the coat torn already?I am highly disappointed in the quality of this coat. How do they expect it to survive kids if the material is so thin??I am giving it 2 stars because it fit as expected and did keep her warm, but would not recommend this coat to anyone who actually wants their child to wear it."

She wears a 3T/4T in most clothes. I ordered the XXS. The sizing is really weird. The arms are SUPER long, but the waist is very thin. Once her arms fit properly, the waist will likely be too slim. So that’s disappointing.If the sizing was better, I’d give it 5 stars. We live in Iowa and it’s already in the 40’s some days, but this coat keeps my daughter warm. I just really wish it wasn’t so weirdly shaped so we could reuse it next year."
474,Georgette Potter,3.0,the United States ,"February 9, 2022",What I like and dislike about the coat,I love the coat however the fur on the hood is buttoned on and it does not stay buttoned. I am sure it is for washing purposes but I had to end up taking the fur off which did not make me happy.
475,Joshua Herman,3.0,the United States ,"January 29, 2022",Cute,Cute coat. Arrived quickly. We had to exchange because the first one had a hole. I didn't realize until receiving the replacement that the fur was odd on the first one. Everything is perfect with the replacement.
476,Amazone Customare,3.0,the United States ,"November 22, 2016","Size S is too snug on waist, fits everywhere else","My daughter is 5 years old and wears a solid size 7 in everything. She is athletic built and tall. The size S (7/8) fits her perfectly on the arms and the length hits her right below her butt, which is a great length for keeping warm during winter. The color we chose, Bright Plum, looks as bright as it does on the photo here. The coat is not too bulky to wear with a seatbelt. There is no OmniHeat lining in this one, but I feel it would be warm enough to withstand most of the cold temps New England throws our way.However, the waist, which tapers in at her natural waist, is so snug that she can't comfortably zip this closed unless she's wearing only ultra thin thermal shirts under her coat. Since she will be wearing this coat to school on top of sweaters and layers and etc, she needs a different coat. I need to point out I tried this on her again after she ate dinner and it was an even more snug fit on her tummy. I am really reluctant to order this in a size M, since its marked as size 10/12 and she is nowhere near that. I've also had Columbia kids coats before and know their arms tend to run really long, so the M size sleeves on her would be ridiculously long.Update - The M fits, with long arms but room to grow!"
477,Michelle,3.0,the United States ,"January 15, 2019",Not Satisifed With Purchase,I purchased this coat for my six year old daughter.  I was excited to receive it because the color is very pretty and it fit her well.  But after wearing it a few times I noticed that any little thing that spilled on the coat was leaving a stain or a mark.  I have washed the coat two times on the normal cycle since purchase in November but am very dissatisfied with how the stains are staying on the material.  I also found a tear on the inside near the left shoulder.  I would say my daughter has worn this coat between 20-30 times so I don't feel the material should already be tearing.  I don't see this coat lasting for several years as I hoped it would.

It is definitely warm enough for Michigan winters, good playing in the snow coat.  The thing I don't like is how bulky it is, which makes it not great for wearing in the car.  Instead she usually wears has to do the on/off shuffle."
480,Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States ,"December 24, 2019",Not stitched fully around the fur.,The hood is tight and the fur is only stitched in places to hold it on so there is gaps from it to the hood.

She also has a 3-piece ski jacket (with zip-in fleece liner) and has had a very difficult time putting it on at school.  Her teachers make the kids put on their coats/zip by themselves and we needed to find something easier for her.  This coat works!!She's about 45"" tall and 42 lbs.  We ordered the XS (6-6x) and it fits her.  The fit is a little strange - tight around the waist and bulky in the shoulders.  Given the tight waist, we'll probably only get one winter of wear.  However, we kept it since it zips easy and she's loves the bright color/fur."

When I received the large, it was wrapped in plastic wrap and bubble wrap and it looked like it was brand new, but with the Medium, it wasn't wrapped at all, it looked like someone bought it returned it then sent it to me. Thats my only reason why for giving 4 stars, it was an easy fix and return though. It doesn't look that warm like the picture but if you wear a bunch of layers I'm sure you'll be fine."
488,Rizthewhizz,4.0,the United States ,"December 21, 2017",Jacket is amazing. Mind the size while ordering,"The jacket is very warm and instead of Columbia website, I ordered from Amazon because of great price deal available in this color. I normally order size 4 for my 3.5 yo kido but based on other reviewers comments, I decided to order size 3 and BOY they were right. Size 3 fits my daughter perfectly. Sleeves are even a bit longer so she has to fold a little. It will definitely be useful in next winter as well.The jacket is warm enough to wear outdoors in Western NY weather!"
489,KMM,4.0,the United States ,"November 30, 2017",Very warm,"This coat is nice and warm for very cold conditions.  The fur around the hood is removable.The sleeves have a piece that comes out with my daughter's hands every time she puts them in.  I don't know if it is part of the cuff or a lengthener for kids arms, but it is annoying because we have to push it back in every time she puts the coat on.  Otherwise, this coat is perfect."

Great quality, not too bulky either. It seems like it will keep a girl warm during the cold Michigan winter months! I like how the fur trim on the hood can be removed, but I'd LOVE it if the entire hood could be removed. Unfortunately, that's not an option with this coat. Overall very pleased with this purchase!"

493,Megan Warnstaff,5.0,the United States ,"November 25, 2022",Runs large,Just as expected and good quality. It’s also very cute. But this coat seems to be a little large. My daughter has 3 or 4 other Columbia jackets in the same size (3t) and they fit perfect. This jacket for some reason is very large on her. The arms fit way long and she has a ton of extra room inside. I wish I would have sized down in this coat.

She is petite compared to most toddlers her age so I was surprised to see how snug they were on her. She only weighs 25lbs, even when I hold the leggings up they look very small not being worn. Not sure about other sizes but the 2t sizes look like they run a bit small in my opinion. Other wise I think the material is good enough to withstand a toddlers daily activities."

What I received has a bright pink pair instead of red, and when I checked back, indeed the listing says pink. Overall these are true to size and will work for my daughter. I gave three stars because the material is kind of rough. I wouldn’t have bought them in a store based on the feel of the fabric."

Wears 10/12 in kids and I purchased the large which fit perfectly. I've been buying leggings at Ross/Burlington but they are poorly made and easily wear. These Amazon Essentials leggings are Soooo much better. Thicker, stretchier, and the stitching is really good. They fit my daughter well and don't hang out under her belly as most do. I like that these leggings can meet to the belly button. The only slight problem is that one of the legs of the legging is longer than the other leg of the same leggings. (See the pictures only one seemed to be even) but it was just that one that had a bigger difference, the other one wasn't too bad. I didn't notice this until after I washed them. But I don't mind that difference they usually are long and scrunched at the bottom. Hope this helps others make the decision in buying these with ease."

The black and the white are just fine, washed well, fit as expected and the quality is good for the price. Looks like they will easily last her a year of regular wash and wear.However, the navy didn’t do so well. On the very first wash it came out very noticeably faded.  Nothing else is wrong with it, just very faded. They’ll probably end up being used for indoor play pants or maybe wear as PJs."

We experienced warmer winter weather (above 32 degrees and sunny). She stayed warm and dry sitting, sledding, and playing in slightly slushy-ish snow for a few hours. The pants seemed durable, good quality, and fit her well.My kid is slightly taller than average but underweight and has a tiny waist. The length was perfect and the waist was snug on her. the velcro was the loosest it could be. I didn't need to tighten them at all. I'd recommend sizing up if in doubt. We got a small and they fit her well but again, she's very thin. Pants in small usually need to be cinched in on her."

However, waist is small.  Even with velcro tab, cannot use for more than one season so will likely pass on to her sister.  We ordered a medium and our daughter is 9 1/2 years old and a a gymnast so not chubby.  So, just think of your child's physique if you choose to buy this product.

But she will probably not be able to use it next winter. she wore it very briefly in the snow, the moisture did not seep into the fabric which sometimes happens with kids playing roughly in the snow and the waterproof layer is not strong enough against the rubbing and sliding. But we will see at the next, longer snow session!"
586,S Hay,4.0,the United States ,"January 18, 2020",Well made snow pants that keep your kid warm and dry,These snow pants are extremely well made.  The internal cuffs in the legs keep snow from getting into the boots and higher waist keep snow from getting down the back.  They kept my daughter warm and dry on very wet snow as she played for hours.  My only complaint is sizing.  After reading reviews and the specifications we ordered the extra small and they were still too big.  She’s 42” tall and these were easily a size too big.  The good news is that we’ll get at least another year of use out of them.
587,Amazon Customer,4.0,the United States ,"December 13, 2019",Did not fit as expected,"I bought this in two sizes (medium and large) but neither fit my daughter. I was excepting more give in the waist because the description and other reviews indicated the waist band was adjustable. You can make it tighter with the Velcro but it doesn’t have any elasticity to make it bigger. Ultimately, the medium was the right length but the waist was too narrow and the large was significantly longer. Neither worked for my daughter but the color and the material were lovely and had there been more give in the waist these would have been perfect"
588,BoBo,4.0,the United States ,"December 11, 2019","Nice, unique design",I bought these snow pants to replace a bib-style set that my daughter had grown out of. They have Velcro straps on each hip to help adjust.  They fit true to size. She has yet to use these in the snow as we haven’t had a snowfall yet. One star deduction as she wasn’t crazy about the colors when she received these. I’ll update once we use these in the snow.
589,Emme,4.0,the United States ,"March 30, 2021",Good for kids with small waist.,Waist is disproportionately small. Would only be good for some work a very small waist. My 6yo fits then fine but she’s very tiny.

Unfortunately, she falls into two sizes so this fits a little loose around the waist, but is extremely long.  This may be more a fault of my daughter's size versus the company itself, though.She absolutely loves the warmth of them, and the lack of upper bib.  And the colorful, but neutral color pattern."
592,Pilar,5.0,the United States ,"June 29, 2022",Excellent snow pants,"Great quality and exactly as pictured and expected. My 6 yo is a little bit taller than average so I decided to order one size up and it was the best decision. The pants fit loose but have some Velcro attachments on the belt sides that you can adjust the fitting, that is a great addition! She was very comfortable in it and told me that it would be good to play in the snow because they were comfortable enough. Also, the padding in the pant is excellent! You can surely go with a warmer only under and it would be fine!"

When I got them out of the package I thought ""Oh no! these will swim on her!"" but when she tried them on, the extra length rode up just fine. I compared them to my son's size 6-7 snowpants from Walmart and they're about the same length, so I guess they run true to size. They look nice, seem like good quality, and are comfortable and waterproof. The waist does seem a little narrow for the length so if you're buying for a husky child you may want to think about that."

They fit very baggy and long on her but they work just fine with her coat on and they don't fall down when she's out playing in the snow.  She also has a slender build though so everything fits baggy on her.  Quality of the material is good and the pants are well made.  She loves the color.  Great product for the price.

The packaging tape was help as removing it actively tore the seams more.

They don't fit her great but stay up. She likes the colors, and they wash nicely (I wash cold and dry regular). They just fit kind of weird.

I can only imagine how irritated I’d be wearing these pants so I refuse to put them on my daughter. They also seem shorter than other pants I purchased in this size for her and these have a wider leg. I ended up buying some pants from target that are much softer and honestly look better!

They sort of fit except when she sat down on the floor, the bottoms of the legs rose up and made them a little like high watered pants. The crotch area was really low and so were the pants pockets. It all didn't seem to stay in the right place like it should have showing that in some places they fit and other places it didn't.

I knew they would be wise in the legs on her, most pants are but these aren't even cut in the typical skinny jeans that I normally get her. They are more of a bootcut or straight leg.

When I felt inside, I understood why. The seem is placed odd right over the belly & it very itchy. My daughter is not husky, she is also not a picky kid. If she doesn’t like something that much when it has Tiana on it ( her favorite Princess 👑), that says something! Her skin was irritated just after trying it on.

My granddaughters normally wear sizes 6 and 3 off the rack. I’ve now ordered the only larger size, 8, and hope it’s going to fit her. The dress is cute enough but nothing really special."

781,mntwinsfan1015,3.0,the United States ,"March 9, 2022",Glitter everywhere,I bought the Belle nightgown for my daughter who is 2. I got 3t and it fits her pretty well a little big. She loves to wear this nightgown the only problem is the glitter. It falls off everywhere and is all over her face when she wakes up in the morning. There is glitter all over her bed and pillows. I am afraid it will get in her eyes. I tried washing and drying it to see if that would help but it didn't.

I try to stay away from glitter because it gets everywhere and when it is in the eyes 👀 😭 so I had to return two other items when they showed up with the same gold paint like material that flakes off. I kept this one because she already wore it but she is not allowed to wear in bed.
783,Tiffany,4.0,the United States ,"November 14, 2022",Sparkles and inner seam aren’t very soft,My 2 year old is obsessed with this dress! Overall the material is soft and stretchy. My only issues with the dress are the material that the sparkles are on is not very soft and the inner seam where the belt is isn’t very soft. I actually bought this as a Halloween costume for her and it was perfect for that purpose! I don’t think I’d put her in it to sleep in though.

She has an Elsa and Belle so far. Only negative is that the glitter rubs off. It’s not immediately noticeable, but I think it gets progressively worse over time. I wouldn’t let this deter me from purchasing them again. The other important consideration is the sizing. They run small, so size up. My daughter had just turned 3 and the 4T fit perfectly. She is in the lower percentiles for her size and age, so the dresses are definitely small. She is not big for her age."

The price was good when I purchased but it appears that it has gone up 33%+ since. Return process was simple and easy since they offered free returns.

Her jacket appeared to be soft and made from a more luxurious fleece than the one I received.  It is quite possible the manufacturer changed the fabric or I received two knockoffs.  (I bought one for myself as well.)  I ordered a black jet expecting to receive jet black.  Instead, the jacket looked like a washed out ashy or dark grey color.  The fleece feels cheap."

My grand daughter didn’t care for this as much as the nautica I bought at the same time. I think it was because we are using it as a mid layer for skiing under her ski coat. This Columbia was a bit thick and her arms couldn’t fold as comfortably. Still nice and she wore it around the Cottage.

Not sure why the sleeves are longer. I had originally ordered a smaller size and the body of the jacket was way to small and arms were freakishly long.  I had to return it and ordered 1 size up and the fit is better other than the arms. Not sure if I read the previous reviews right and ordered the wrong size to begin with.

My 4 year old was really upset when she went to put on her new star pants and they were way too small. She is a tall string bean of a kid there is no reason they shouldn't have fit if they were sized properly. It was only when we held them up to her current pants, again same brand just 1 size smaller, that we realized just how distorted they were.

861,Nicole,2.0,the United States ,"May 17, 2019",Different factories/countries = different quality!,"So there’s two different factories/country’s that these are made in... the set with the pants pictured in a descending line, is the cheap material. Don’t buy those ones!The set pictured in a row but staggered up and down, is the better material.** I think this is how you determine them.For example: The Meow set is made in Vietnam, is better feeling material, and has different tags than the other.The Animal Masks set is cheaper quality fabric, one pair had a rub mark already on them, and they’re made in India with different tags. I’m returning this set.I wish they’d indicate which country each set is made in.See pics for quality difference.These fit really well. Like carters brand, but a bonus, they’re longer/up a little higher in the waist, so they cover your little ones diaper/bottom better.Edit 5/25/19: so actually there’s a 3rd factory in Bangladesh and the material is kind of in the middle of the two. Its stretchy but not as soft as the one from Vietnam. It’s good enough to keep because I’m tired of returning them. I don’t think I’ll ever buy this brand again. I’ll stick with Carters which is more consistent.Edit 11/12/19: I reduced these to two stars because it’s only been less than 6 months and these are fading and are wearing around the waist band/elastic."

880,Cassie,4.0,the United States ,"October 23, 2022",Sizing is tricky,"For size reference our little one is 3ft and 50lbs, both tall and skinny.I ordered a 7/8 while they fit in the waist and the length they are snug in the legs. Not enough that they are uncomfortable on her but enough that she will not get long wear out of them . Especially tight in the thighs and calves.The pros are they are not thin or see through , the quality of the pants are nice they didn't shrink after being washed or dried and there were minimal strings that needed to be trimmed.  The colors are vibrant and the glitter on the pants didn't mess up which was something I was worried about.  The cat patterned pants are so cute.I would rate these a 7.5 on a scale of 10."
881,Esther,4.0,the United States ,"November 29, 2022",They are great quality for the price!,I got these for my daughter and they are great and we are keeping them.

The waist line, I think, could do with more elasticity. My daughter is outgrowing them really quickly because they are starting to feel uncomfortably tight around the waist. She loves the galaxy themed print, though, and they are soft enough not to irritate her sensory issues."

The Boys XL is SIGNIFICANTLY larger than the Girls XXL. Sizing does not need to be this way for children's clothing.

We typicakly buy clothes size 8 / Medium to have a slightly loose fit. We bought this vest in the usual size. We were happy that it was delivered relatively quickly and looked lightweight and cute (as advertised).  The height was perfect. But the width was too small / too tight. We were able to zip it up on a T-shirt, but there was absolutely no room left. So, it would not fit on a thicker dress or over anything else.  If you have a skinny kid - go for it!  Otherwise, it will be too tight.  And if you size up, it would be too long.  Too bad. We liked it otherwise.  Will be returning."

I read many reviews, but it was difficult to make the decision based on reviews as I didn’t see anyone mention their child’s age on shoe size.My daughter is age 4 with a size 11 shoe. She no longer fits the toddler sized socks or clothing and I shop in the little girls section at department stores for her. She wears a size 6 in girls for clothing. So when I saw “GIRLS socks”, on this listing, I thought these should fit her.HUGE socks, these should be listed as “women’s socks”. I wear a size 7 1/2 shoe in women’s and I’m not even sure these would fit me... maybe after a wash/dry though.So if you are looking for socks for a young girl, a child, do not buy these!However if you are woman or purchasing for maybe a high school aged girl, these just may fit your/her feet.I will say though I felt the socks, they are soft, and have a nice thickness to them. If I needed socks I may have kept them for myself, however I will be returning these. I’m bummed these weren’t the socks for her though as if they would fit her, we would have kept them."

Uncomfortable, poorly executed design.","I set up a return for these 15 minutes after opening them. For starters, the inside of the cow shirt is very rough and scratchy. It's an unpleasant texture. The cow appliques, while adorable, are very thick and they used lots of glue and rough stitching to achieve that look. They clearly did not think about the soft, tender skin of a small child sleeping in it. Quite frankly, I would not like it either.Next, the pants. As soon as I took these out I knew they wouldn't work. Tried them on over the pajama pants kiddo was wearing (thin cotton) and the waist was so big, it could probably fit a four year old. Pant hem down under heel. She is average weight and height for a 28 mos old.All in all very disappointing, since she loves cows and that was the whole reason for buying these."

It‘s the right length though. My daughter is very slender, but she still found it uncomfortable. We might cut the sleeves off to see if she’ll wear it that way. Also, the pants were loose at the waist and kept falling down. So it’s too small/tight (shirt) and too big (pants) at the same time. Maybe she will grow into the pants later, but then it won’t have a coordinating shirt. Not a good buy."

The cow outfit was the one I was most excited for and I hate the inside of the top. The cow decals are very stiff  and seem like they would be very uncomfortable. Also the pants are super cute and soft but don’t fit her right. She’s a bit tall and lean and these seem like they’d fit a shorter chunkier toddler. They keep falling down and are almost too short.

1217,med_bookworm,5.0,the United States ,"December 10, 2022",Nice to have for older children!,Our 5yo was very happy to get the fuzzy onsies.  Many brands stop making at the 5T and she need 6T or 7T.  The patterns are cute but the main attraction is staying warm for a child who moves around a lot while sleeping and has difficulty keeping the blanket on.
1218,Amazon Customer,5.0,the United States ,"November 9, 2022",Finally bigger sizes!,My 3 year old will only sleep in footie pjs. Has been that way since delivery in the hospital (even the nurses were quite surprised in the difference in her being in footies in mid July) It is getting harder to find bigger sizes. She is beyond happy to finally have footies that her toes don't poke out of and aren't being stretched due to her height. They aren't the tight fitting ones where you have size up either. The material is soft and comfy even after a few washes. Hope they keep making more.
1219,Jay Ree,5.0,the United States ,"December 13, 2022",Comfy Jammies,"Well made, soft, and fit great.  These were for our grandaughter's birthday.  They are the kind of jammies she likes.  They were perfect."

Both were slightly large on them, but I’m glad they will get another year out of them. No other company makes footies in larger sizes!"
1221,Lady Artemis,5.0,the United States ,"November 25, 2022",Nice & Comfortable,My 5 year old Granddaughter loves feet pajamas but they are hard to find at a decent price any bigger than a size 5T.

1227,M.E,1.0,the United States ,"April 18, 2022",Used jacket,"I bought two jackets for my daughter. A blue and  ivory, the ivory colored jacket unfortunately was sent to me used. Had no tag, stains all over. The inside has black fibers I’m assuming form layering of other clothing and had hairs inside the jacket. If it wasn’t for that it’s a nice jacket fits true to size. Was very disappointed as we were going on a trip and had made my order just in time for our trip but once I opened it and saw it made me mad and disappointed."
1228,Alicia Gordon,1.0,the United States ,"February 5, 2022",Please do not buy this coat.,"This coat started off being a beautiful item, but out of nowhere, it ripped under the arm.  It did not have any pre-existing holes or tears.  My child put it on earlier that day and stored it in the cubby at school.  There were no holes in the item as my husband put the coat on that we could see. There is absolutely no way to fix it.  I would like to add this is the 2nd coat that has done this so buyers please beware. Now I have to go out to find a coat today due to the wintry weather we are scheduled to have."

1231,Andrew,1.0,the United States ,"April 20, 2022",Poorly made,There were threads hanging off after washed. Some of the stitching was not even. Like the machine was having hiccups or something.

1232,Alexandre M.,1.0,the United States ,"March 11, 2021",Buyer Beware,"Love the look of this jacket. However the jacket we received was clearly used (scuffed snaps, stains, small rip, a child’s full name written on the jacket label)! Also you purchased the same style for my son - his jacket arrived and smelled overwhelmingly of cigarette smoke. Ick. I purchased these both new. So disappointed in the quality control."

1238,Emily D.,2.0,the United States ,"October 25, 2021",Sizing didn't work for us,The sizing on this jacket just did not work for us. My 5.5 yo felt the size small was too snug- it was. The underarms were pinched and the jacket short. The size medium was too big with arms too long and an overall snug feel. Unfortunately it is going back despite the lovely print.
1239,Annie,2.0,the United States ,"February 1, 2021",Armpit hole after two months,"Hole in the armpit after 2 months of wearing. Usually, I get North Face jackets for my kids...three daughters so they can pass them down. I’ve never had a jacket wear out, and  all three girls wear them for a year before donating them. I tried an Amazon jacket this year for my oldest because the reviews were good and the price is so much better. Unfortunately, the quality is terrible. Huge hole in the armpit after 2 months of light wear. Very disappointing."

Man könnte es ""federleicht"" nennen.Alleine für diese Irreführung hätte die Jacke keinen einzigen Stern verdient.Meinen Ausgangsplan, sie zurück zu senden, habe ich jedoch dennoch verworfen , weil:- sie sehr sauber und gut genäht ist- sie trotzdem schön warm hält- nicht beschwert- innen einen ""Windfang"" innen, wie eine  Skijacke, zum  ​zuknöpfen hat d.h. die Kälte zieht nicht am ​Rücken hoch- die Bündchen Daumenlöcher haben- der Reißverschluß solide sowie  leichtgängig ist- die Jacke in einem schönen Rosa, wie abgebildet, ist- sie insgesamt an sich recht hübsch ist​- größengerecht ausfällt--> meine Tochter total begeistert war.Für Regen oder Nässe ist sie jedoch nicht geeignet.Zusammenfassend:Wer eine preisgünstige (25€) hübsche, recht solide, warme (Zweit,Dritt-)Jacke für die kalte Jahreszeit sucht ist hier, trotz der falschen Deklarierung, ganz gut beraten."

My daughter’s had the coat for about two weeks and the zipper is completely broken. The pull broke off and the zip piece won’t come back down from the top. Luckily, I can still snap it so that she can wear it. She gets tons of compliments since the print is so cute and the fit is superb. Oh, and we love the thumb holes!! I just wish we could get a new one or the zipper pull fixed. I’m frustrated that we had it for such a short time and it’s already broken."

1250,Marielle,3.0,the United States ,"December 31, 2021",Good for cold but not for snow,The coat is good for cold but not the snow. The outside really holds the water when it gets wet. Not good for playing in the snow. The coat ends up getting logged with water on the outside and then kiddos start to get cold.
1251,Casey B.,3.0,the United States ,"January 15, 2022",Daughter looks like a linebacker with shoulder pads,Coat quality seems fine it’s just very boxy and has the look of having large shoulder pads.  Which is a little much for a two year old. Lol.Not my favorite.
1252,Liane,3.0,the United States ,"December 17, 2021",Decent coat,"We loved our last coat like this so I bought the next size up for my 8 year old this winter. This coat is coming apart at the seams, maybe I got a bad one."

My daughter likes the hood and and the weight and the thumbholes on the interior sleeves but HATED the smell when we unpackaged it. I'm not kidding you, it was awful. I had to convince her that I got the smell out after washing it because she didn't want to touch it again. Good jacket, stinky out of the package."

1262,Professorowl,4.0,the United States ,"December 19, 2019",Great jacket with a design flaw...,"This is a nice winter jacket. My daughter said that it keeps her warm in the cold weather, and even though it is a ""puffy"" jacket, she said she has no problem swinging on the monkey bars or climbing up trees. She also likes the zipper guard feature located at the top of the zipper because it protects her neck and under her chin from getting scratched by the zipper handle. The hood offers nice coverage and stays on even in windy conditions. This jacket also goes well with the Amazon Basics snowpants. The jacket is true to size, but if you want to size up one size (like we did), the jacket will still fit all right, especially because it is quite ""puffy,"" so it doesn't look quite as big as thinner jackets might.The jacket tends to dry quickly EXCEPT for the cuffs. This is why I took off one star. The cuffs are absolutely awful! I think the designer(s) thought they were adding a modern and ""cool"" feature to the jacket by making cuffs that resemble the cuff design of the thin, stretchy long-sleeve shirts with the thumb holes. Unfortunately, this ""cool"" feature does not dry quickly (like the rest of the jacket), so when my kiddo plays outside in the snow, the cuffs are soaking wet for hours afterwards. I wish they had made the cuffs out of the same quick-dry nylon fabric as the rest of the outside of the jacket. Even with this flaw, I would still recommend this jacket."
1263,Amber Beront,4.0,the United States ,"November 22, 2019",Great garment...at what price?,"My 7 year old daughter and i are both very happy with this coat. The material and construction are good quality. Attention to detail is great:-sleeve interior is slippery fabric, which is nice for kids!-thumb holes in sleeves-Fleecy interior of coat and the zip up pockets makes this jacket cozy.-Extra long in the back keeps the bum warm and dry.-Zip guard at neck really pleases my daughter's chin and the hood goes up without choking her while fully zipped!-there is an interior slip proof belt to keep out snow and keep the jacket in place over snowpants...Everything about this jacket is great except for three things:1. No color choices. Only came in navy with pink interior.2. Amazon does not treat its employees well or pay well and i have to wonder about the ethics of this garment.3. Amazon paid no taxes last year on their profits, which also harm the ethics of this garment.Anyone concerned with economic stability should think long and hard before buying amazon essentials products. How can they offer this fine of a product for this great price without compromising their employees well being and our economic stability?"
1264,Kathleen M. Machacek,4.0,the United States ,"December 16, 2021",Nice warm coat but does look dirty after washing,"This is a nice coat for a child that is active. It does a wonderful job of keeping my daughter warm and she loves the colors. I’ve washed it twice but it did look dirty afterwards, like kind of a muddy look. This is a good play coat for outside, but I wouldn’t want her to wear it to a nice occasion."
1265,Nikki Burch,5.0,the United States ,"December 4, 2022",Great winter jacket!!,Really nice and comfy winter jacket. Not too thick but definitely not thin!My daughter is almost 9 and I got her a large which was perfect.My son is 7 and the medium was HUGE so I exchanged it for a small.These jackets are super soft and comfy. They are super sturdy with a big heavy duty zipper and a lot of buttons to secure it. Wish they made one in adult size. I bought them for 60% off so they were about $25 each and it is definitely the best value ever! Even at $40 I still would’ve purchased and loved! Definitely recommend.
1266,Raising RoseGold,5.0,the United States ,"December 13, 2022",Great quality,"Love all of the features! Thumb holes, zip up and snap up, hood, and waterproof liner snap on the inside to reduce water from getting inside while child is sitting. We got the size small. Little one is 39lbs, and is 44 inches tall. Its a tad big on her but will be able to wear next season as well."
1267,LoSa,5.0,the United States ,"November 17, 2022",Impressed!,"I am so impressed with this adorable coat. Usually Amazon Essentials is decent quality/ no frills. Perfect for kids who grow so fast and you're only using these items for a couple months. But I gotta say, I am really impressed with this coat! The pictures don't do it justice. Zip pockets, there's a strap inside to help keep it from riding up, zipper and snaps, and my favorite is that the sleeve has a little hidden piece that they can put their thumbs into so when the put on gloves, there isn't that glove/coat gap where their little wrists get super cold or filled with snow. For the same price at Carters, or less than the athletic brands like Nike, this one is def a big win."

This isn’t a lightweight coat it’s definitely a warm winter coat. I’m not quite sure it’s 100% waterproof but it did great for her playing out in the snow.

However, mine was shipped without any packaging aside from it's original clear plastic bag. I do not consider this sufficient to protect my purchase from the elements. Nor do I want everyone else in the universe to know what arrives at my residence, no matter how inconsequential the purchase may seem to the seller. Also, I think they are supposed to notify you if something is supposed to arrive in it's original packaging or display the contents. Hence, the one star review."

There is no soft backing to cover the inside zipper. It’s very scratchy and leaves little red marks on the skin. We as adults wouldn’t like it - so why would they do it for a baby? I usually like Carter’s products but this is one not to buy! They usually put a soft backing on the zippers. Disappointing!

So I bought these pjs for the cold morning we have during our “Florida winters.” My daughter is 2.5 and wears 2T in mostly everything. I got these in 3T so they could be roomier Andre last longer. They run small IMO. What’s worse is that each pjs is a different size. They all say 3T but run very differently. Only the pink fox fits her good. The other two are too short and tight around her thighs. One much more than the other, I forgot which. So I bought these and was only able to use two of them once because it was too tight around the shoulder area since the length was short. So disappointed. By the time I went to use them I was out of the return policy. Money down the drain."

When I received my order I was shocked to see a prominent label inside stating “Keep away from fire”!  Who wants to give parents baby nightwear with a frightening tag like that! It certainly did not give me confidence that the product was flame retardant! I returned them and I am very disappointed in Carter’s.

1293,Sue Hill,2.0,the United States ,"November 16, 2019",Fabric isn’t breathable and our baby overheats,Our granddaughter wont wear these.  We’ve tried them and washed them a few times and re-tried them.  She ends up peeling them off after about 20 minutes.  She doesn’t do this with any of her other onesies.  These fit her nicely and are comfortable for her to move in; they stretch and bend nicely.  It seems that when she’s peeling these off its because her skin is clammy and she feels too hot. I think this fabric doesn’t breathe.  It feels soft but I note that it is made in China and is synthetic.  Whatever the weave is doesn’t allow for any breathability.  Our baby granddaughter can’t stand the smothered feeling from these.  So we are going to look for some other brand than Carters.  Sad - we always used Carters with her mom when she was growing up.  We found some Burts Bees cotton pj’s and we’ll try those.
1294,Gregory B,2.0,the United States ,"March 1, 2021",Very skinny legs,"These 12 month sleep and plays are awkward fitting. My daughter was in the 9 month sleep and plays but she got too long for them, so I bought these. However, they are really long, the feet are huge, and yet the legs are really skinny... I can barely get my daughter's legs into these. I have 9 month sleep and plays in both fleece and normal material and they both fit perfectly, except the length, there's no problems with her legs being too chuncky. My daughter is at the 70th percentile for both height and weight."

The sleeves are short and through the night they ride up and die to the hemming, it’s hard to pull them down. It’s too stiff. No stretch in the edge of the sleeve which is very uncomfortable for my baby. Yes it makes the pajama “cuter”, but functionality suffers."

1310,Amazon Customer,4.0,the United States ,"April 15, 2021",Forget the Haters,"I’m not sure why so many reviews are bad for these. I have struggled to find fleece sleepers this time of year (April) for my 6.5 month old who wears 6-9/9M currently. Her room is extremely cold, so she needs fleece under her sleep sack at night. She is in the 75th percentile for height (27.5 in currently), and with her large overnight diaper and owlet we use on her foot, I planned to go up a size in whatever I found. With the other reviews saying how small these run, I ordered 12M and 18M just to be safe (and planned to send whichever back that didn’t work). I’m happy to report that the 12M work just fine, and they are even roomie for her! They are definitely too long, but everywhere else they fit great. I don’t want her pajamas to be tight anyway, and it allows plenty of room for her overnight diaper. I’m happy that they will fit for a while and she also won’t grow out of them in a couple months. It’s not an issue to be that there is extra fabric just at her feet.Overall they are very soft and warm. The flannel isn’t the highest quality flannel in the entire world, but I am satisfied. She will get good use out of these! The only thing I will say is that I think they are priced a little too high in my opinion, but I was happy to find any fleece pjs at this point and was willing to pay.For reference, she is 18.5 lbs and 26.5” long. She’s not super chubby, but she’s also not thin."

And my daughter doesn’t have wide feet. It’s a defect of the pyjama…"

The symmetry is also off. They would end up causing a wedgie because the hip and butt shifts so far to the left or right.Overall these are horrible underwear. I’ll never buy Hanes again. I should have known better seeing as all the underwear I’ve ever bought for my family were fruit of the loom.I’m returning these and will stick with Cat & Jack and fruit of the loom.They aren’t even worth the $6 sale price on Prime Day.Save your money and buy something else."

This time it is made in Vietnam. It is smaller than the one I ordered before. I guess it matters on where it is made from. I think they have a different size chart. So beware!

Shame on me for washing without trying them on her. They are too short and don’t cover all her butt. The prints seem to be slightly smaller than the solids for some reason, but none of them fit. She’s age 5 1/2, 43 inches tall, and 34 pounds. She still wears the 2-3T underwear from when she potty trained over 2 years ago. I would have thought the size 4 would be bigger.

After getting package after package of princess-branded gruns in the hopes that she'd try harder not to soil them, I gave up and bought these. They actually sent the wrong color, but we didn't arrive at this point by being picky so it was fine. I was surprised that these actually fit like her size 4 pants--snug, she's in size 5/6 now--as opposed to all her other size 4 panties (those 7-packs with characters on them) which are still super baggy and go up to her belly button. It turns out the princesses don't make any difference, so I'm going to stick with these going forward, and hope against hope that soon kids' underwear can stop being a weekly purchase for me."

1381,JillianKK,1.0,the United States ,"May 15, 2022",Waist is elastic,I bought these because the description made me think they had the soft cotton waist band.  They do not.  It's just a cheap scratchy elastic band like every other brand apparently.  My search continues.
1382,Amazon Customer,1.0,the United States ,"October 3, 2022",I only recieved 13 pairs and I ordered a 14 pack.,I only got 13 of 14 pairs

1384,M,1.0,the United States ,"January 17, 2021",Chemical Smell,The package looked odd as if it was a knock off. Not at all like the packaging in a store and not like the packaging seen in pictures of other reviews here. However the underwear looked legit. The chemical smell was awful! I washed and soaked the underwear twice and the smell would not go away. I gave up and threw them out. Now the smell is stuck in my washing machine. The smell is sickening.
1385,David,2.0,the United States ,"May 1, 2021",Cute and comfortable BUT just did not last,"I initially gave these a 5 star rating. But I had to come back to update with a review. (I just realized that this is my second review on kids underwear...mom life amiright? Lol)So I got these for my now 4-yr-old after she graduated from her potty training pants (which she still wears sometimes until she completely outgrows them). I really liked these...AT FIRST.Pros:They came in a 14 pack! Enough to last her 2 whole weeks! (Although we do kids laundry at least once a week but just in case ya know??) Anyways, the pattern/prints are great, my little one fell in love on the first day. They are very soft and stretchy enough to not cut into her skin. And I really like how thin yet durable the fabric is. (Her potty training pants were too thick and they bunch up under her leggings therefore I had to upgrade her to big girl undies). Most importantly, the price is awesome! I believe I got them for 3 BUCKS while on sale! Thanks Amazon!Con:The elastics on the waist just did not last as long as I hoped. They are no longer holding up onto her hips. I’m tossing them one by one.The 2 stars are for 1) how cute and comfortable they were 2) what a deal I got on them. Unfortunately, I will not be repurchasing. Even though my little one really liked them, the search for better underwear continues for this momma."

I did wash and dry them first so maybe they shrunk, but I'm not planning to hang dry underwear, so they really need to fit after they go through the dryer."
1390,CB,2.0,the United States ,"July 18, 2021",Did not get what I ordered…,"Bought SPECIFICALLY for the style as most undergarments don’t fit my daughter very well. Through purchasing several brands and cuts, I have found the fruit of the loom hipsters WITH the fabric covered waistband to be the only ones that work for us. I was excited to find these on Amazon bc they are always sold out in stores. When received, we were disappointed to find that these aren’t the same style we had been looking for despite the product photo being so.I do not mind color variation at all. Color doesn’t matter as long as it is the actual product I purchased, but these are a different style all together and do not fit well. I thought I was getting the hipsters with the “fabric-covered” waistband, not the ones with the “plush” waistband. Trust me, there IS a difference of size and fit between the two! Purchase elsewhere if fit matters to you."

I've bought undershirts for my husband, tank tops for myself and socks and undies for my kids. The quality has always been good and comfortable.This review is based on the fact that my daughter chose these underwears specifically because they contained two unicorn undies, which were not included. I received every single underwear that's in the picture except for the unicorn ones. As you can see in the picture I provided, I even laid the underwear in the same order as the picture and you'll see that the two underwear that are suppose to be unicorn, are not.Please know that my star review isn't based on the quality, it's based on their advertisement of products that don't reflect what you get."
1393,Dunn Girls,2.0,the United States ,"March 12, 2020","Different pattern, same fit.","Fit is fine, fabric is fine, this is my child’s preferred style and brand of undergarment.  My problem is with the print.  We ordered polka dots and black and white and light pink solids.  What we received were navy blues hearts, rainbow confetti, and dark pinks.  The listing was for assorted patterns, which is what the packaging says bc it’s assorted colors and patterns in one package.  The listing should say seller picks color or no color choice available.  I’m keeping them bc we need them, but again I am disappointed in the misrepresentation of their item by showing a more desirable pattern than what is actually available.  My 10yo is very very slender so she has to wear “little girl” undies, but she wanted “big girl” patterns.  I guess that’s just a hazard of shopping online."

But they are underwear and I never saw anything about not getting what you ordered or getting a randomly chosen pack.  We ordered the unicorn/pegasus ones because my daughter loves both.  If it wasnt a hassle to send back and she says they are comfortable, we would send them back.  Had I paid full price they for sure would have went back.  Just be warned you may not get what you think you are ordering."
1395,C,3.0,the United States ,"December 3, 2022",Great quality size UP,I really enjoyed these undoes for my daughter HOWEVER it would be a good idea to have known to size up because the actual sizes are about 2 sizes too small. I'd say it is a DEFECT because we have size 5s that we bought at a store and they are about 1 inch bigger than the size 6s I got off Amazon ..... sad to have washed these before we used then so now I can't return them /:
1396,Amstar,3.0,the United States ,"September 10, 2022",Wrong internet description,"I order these for my daughter. It says pack of 14 don’t let if fool you, we only for 10. So not as much of a good deal as I was originally thinking. They are a little big."
1397,Laurelle,3.0,the United States ,"April 7, 2022",Why do girls undies run so dang small?,"So even as a grown woman I have to buy three or more sizes up in underwear to get them to fit properly. Apparently this trend starts young! My daughter is 2 and I had to get her size 6. She is big for her age, but in all her other clothes she is a size 4. I just don't get it... I guess even in toddler underwear they have to make them run stupidly small! I don't have this problem with my son, who is also a big kid mind you. Anyway, just size up I guess. The quality is fine otherwise."
1398,Mother of Pearl 3,3.0,the United States ,"May 7, 2022",It’s OK for now,I don’t know what is up with the size charts these days but they don’t seem to represent the measurements indicated.  I bought these for my 6yo daughter who is tall and solid at 6yo - 4’4” and 85lbs.  Her Hanes size 10s we’re getting small so I bought the Fruit of the Loom size 12 based on the size chart measurements.  They fit like the size 10s Hanes. I should just stick with Hanes. Fruit always ran smaller to me. Will not buy again.

If I don’t like the color I have the right to say I don’t like it! The material wasn’t that great! The seams were not done evening throughout- it seemed as if the sewing machine was working only half way! It’s not hard to do a seam..overall in my opinion the product was very cheap! Poorly made and the material used to make was extremely poor!After the first was the seams were breaking which confirms the poorly made product, we pre-wash everything before wearing simply out of caution, I was actually quite surprised as to how the seams were falling apart. I went ahead and order Hanes. We will stick with them now."
1484,Hoppin Momma,1.0,the United States ,"November 6, 2021",Poor inseam sewing - irritates skin,"This product is poorly sewn. I bought these for a 7 years old who is in the 35th percentile in height/weight (so small for her age). I bought size 8 after reading that these tend to run small.I washed all of these one time before use on cold. They’re definitely small for a size 8. My biggest complaint is that the left side of the inseam (where the two pieces of cloth are seen together) is done very poorly. There is a bulge that irritates the skin, since there is basically a lump in the clothing. They can’t be worn without skin irritation.My daughter is not known to have sensitive skin, but her skin was bright red after wearing these."

They were way too tight and small. Nice colors/patterns and fabric, but, given that Fruit of the Loom girls underwear runs true to size in stores, I wonder if Fruit of the Loom only distributes to Amazon products that are somehow inferior/not true to size? I wonder about this b/c we have also found the inconsistent sizing problem when purchasing Skechers on Amazon -- again, a brand w/consistent sizing when purchasing from brick-and-mortar stores."

1556,Suspense and Thriller Lover,3.0,the United States ,"April 29, 2017",Great sweater and good quality... but,"This zip up sweatshirt is really super cute.  It's well-made, thick enough, it fits great  and it only took a few short days to get here. However,  unfortunately the manufacturers or sellers fold the sweatshirt in such a way that each side of Minnie's  face is folded onto each other.  Then when you pull it apart the paint  from one side of Minnie's face transfers to the other side of her face leaving marks and blemishes all over her face.  I'm sure I could've returned the item with no problems,  but my daughter really needed a sweater asap  and the damage wasn't so bad that she couldn't wear it.  If I had more time I would have returned it,  but luckily like I said,  even with the damage the product was still in good enough shape that my daughter still wears it  almost every day.  And any four-year-old little girl who loves Minnie Mouse will absolutely love the sweater and won't even notice that one little issue.  It's something that would more bother the parents than anything else.  All in all I would purchase this item again.  But I do hope the sellers read this so that they can change the way they fold the item.  This issue is very easily preventable  if it were just folded in the opposite direction."

It is labelled a 2-4.  My niece is tall for her age.  She needs a size 4 that is proportionately long enough to fit her slim and tall build.  According to the toddler range of sweatshirt patterns in my collection that I have sewn in the past, the sweatshirt is a Toddler 4 in chest circumference but is a short size 2 in body length.  The sleeves look disproportionately long for the body length.  Other than being poorly sized, the shirt is nicely made but heavier fabric would be nice for cold winter months ahead.

I should have known for the price of $5 each, something would be wrong, I more expected something minor, like annoying tag or hem coming out. But these are terribly under-sized. I don’t appreciate the hassle of returns, especially during CORONA when getting out id very limited. for seller being too lazy to correct the issue, by informing buyers in bold lettering next to pricing, that they are extremely under-sized, so I could have made adjustments in sizing or ordered another color that was twice the price, but would fit properly, or so I could just skip it.

The shirt had no stretch or give to it at all, and the material is very thin. I would only recommend the white one as an undershirt since you can see through it.

It luckily still fits OK and I only bought it to sleep in anyway, but keep that in mind when ordering.

I was a little apprehensive about the sherpa liner, as we have only ever bought the jackets with the standard quilted liner, but it's great. The jacket is warm. The color is a vibrant purple so she's easy to spot. I bought a size up so she has plenty of room to grow into it, and she can wear plenty of layers without the jacket getting snug. It's a great jacket!"

I contacted the manufacturer first, and since I told them I wanted this last hopefully 2 winter seasons, they advise that I would get the size 3T! It fits now with definitely some room to grow, but not exceedingly loose which is perfect! I can see us getting 2 New England Winters out of this jacket"

Saddly these were frayed and falling apart on bottom after wearing once. Initially I Thought it was the shoes or just one pair or my kids did something weird that day but it happened with different shoes to almost every pair. I kept trying because they are comfortable and my daughter is very picky about how socks feel. I sort of wondered if it was a counterfeit product.  The return process however was easy.

These were an immediate hit with them and while kids in general don't much care about one pair of socks over another, an exception is made for Under Armour. I must register a small complaint made by the parents of the kids. These have a bit of a tendency to pill up just a bit compared to adult UA socks. They are still quality socks, but they aren't quite perfect.

These fit her foot perfectly, but I'm worried they might be a bit tight above the ankle. I'll have to double-check the size I ordered in relation to her shoe-size to make sure it wasn't shopper's error.

What is the point?  Any other spring like waterproof jacket I have ever purchased at least has a thin lining inside. I cant see how this would stand up to any kid wearing it. No idea how it has nearly 5 stars unless someone is padding the reviews. I expect better from this brand!"

The description stated that it was lightweight, but I was expecting it to be a bit heavier.  It is almost like a throwaway poncho that you wear on a water ride.  Very nicely made, but NOT what I was expecting.  However, my granddaughter loved the beautiful color, and it was pouring today, so she did wear it.  Thankfully, it is large enough that she can wear a sweatshirt under it if needed.  She was happy with it, so that's what matters.  I still wish it was a bit heavier."

1915,Kristin,1.0,the United States ,"August 6, 2022",Awful shape; wide; boxy--returning,"Got these for my 7.5 yo daughter who wears size 7-8 medium. They are awfully wide and boxy--wider than they are long. For something that's meant to be worn underneath other clothes, I'd expect something more close-fitting.I had to run to stores to see if I could get different camis, since my daughter needed a white cami for part of her base costume for a play. Unfortunately, kids camis of other brands seem to be similarly designed, and others I found were also boxy.I ended up buying a $2.98 white WOMENS tank top from Walmart, in size XS, and it actually fits my 7.5 yo perfectly. Close-fitting, about 2"" or more narrower than the girls camis when laid on top. The straps aren't so long that there's a risk of nipples popping out (hopefully you know what I mean). If anything the tank top might be a bit long on her, but since it's so close-fitting it can be nicely tucked in. We didn't bother though, since the length wasn't so much that it looked odd or anything.In short--unless you are looking for a wide, boxy fit, check out the women's tables at Walmart where they have the cheap tank tops folded in stacks. There was no XXS size in stock when I went, but I'll keep an eye out for those as I'd like to see if those might be even better."
1916,PAL's Mom,1.0,the United States ,"August 16, 2021","Cheaply Made, Poor Quality, Square Shape, TOO BIG!","This product is not the usual Fruit of the Loom product that I know. This one I got was so cheaply made, paper thin, oddly shaped, so many loose threads, the stitching and hemming are crooked, and seems to be not going to withstand the initial wash in the washer! If it did, it will get more odd shaped-wider, but shorter, and will probably produce those annoying bumps hanging on the clothes. (Sorry, I don’t know what they are called!).You can see on the photo that it’s not rectangular in shape (long and slim/narrow as shown on the ad), but rather SQUAREish! It’s too wide and too short!It claims on the page ad that it’s true to its size and fits perfectly, but it’s not even close!  I got the same size tanks from Target, but it’s more smaller, proportionately shaped than this one, and much narrower and better made.The same XL bought in store fits my child perfectly. So, why this one looks like a quality control reject?  This is even too big for adults and the cut is too low that it sits lower than my child’s chest, fully exposing it, so what’s the use of a tank top if it covers your abdomen, and not your torso?  Fruit of the Loom, please pay attention to this item you’re selling here in Amazon!  A lot of buyers have the same complaints. Do that not bother you?Why the ones you sell in-stores (Target, Walmart) have better quality, but the ones sold here lacks it?Oh, and it’s truly strange that the tag is printed around the armpit area!"

I ordered a small and they’re still large enough to fit me. So you can imagine how they fit her. Also, usually there is a tag on the back indicating which side is the back or the front…the tag is stamped in the side of the shirts. I wouldn’t care if they were for me, but I’m teaching her life skills…so now she’s completely confused about how to put them on. Would not recommend to purchase for a child."

She’s not skinny, but also not overweight. She is just solid muscle but also developing quickly at a young age (genetics). She is about 93% on her growth chart so on the larger size for her age. They were cut a little big and since they don’t have adjustable straps, her chest was showing on the sides. She refused to wear them which I don’t blame her. The smaller size fit much better though and she was happy. They didn’t shrink in the wash, and so far seem to be holding up. She only wears them under her shirts so they are only worn to school and then when she gets home she changes."

Not remotely the colors pictured.I am a 5'5"" adult with a large C/small D chest that typically wears M-L in most clothing but buy 'M' or 'S/M's for undershirts. Around the same time I ordered some undershirts from a brand geared towards adult women in a 'M' ... child's XL of these FOL girl's undershirts are each other's equivalent. I'd say their child's 'L' is probably like an adult's S/M.This is great for a penny pinching adult but I see why the sizing could be frustrating for people buying for actual kids.Can't speak on longevity yet though I typically wash on normal or delicates setting in cold water but hopefully they are durable like FOL products are known to be."

I had purchased these in large for my daughter to wear under her shirts and dresses but she doesn't like to wear them and would rather not wear the tops/dresses that require her to wear an under shirt. Her dislike of them is not due to comfort but due to thinking it's weird to wear a shirt under a shirt/dress and not wanting kids in her class to call her weird for wearing them.At first I was frustrated that they weren't going to be put to use and was going to donate them all but then I ended up needing a shirt one day on laundry day and seeing as how stretchy these are I decided to throw one on expecting it to maybe fit as a crop top or a bralette for my 5'4"" 34DD mildly squishy belly self...but to my surprise it fit like a glove. Considering majority of my tops, especially tanks are crops, these actually give more coverage than a good portion of my closet and fit comfortably. They aren't long enough to tuck into normal waist pants but they do come down past my belly button and can be tucked into high waisted pants. I eneded up keeping one of each color plus both the black ones and donated the rest."

1981,Kim Smith,4.0,the United States ,"November 30, 2022",The colors are off! See picture,"The top two colors are more of a bold hot pink and then a lighter pink underneath. It’s not the toned down coral and salmon colors as advertised. It’s still cute, but not what I was hoping for. (I had to roll the sleeves up in the picture I took- that’s why they’re white by her hands- but they’re blue on the outside.) It seems like it’ll be warm enough. Fits as expected. I got a 3T for my daughter and she is 30” tall and 27lbs."
1982,Jennifer J Becker,4.0,the United States ,"October 15, 2021",Not a heavy winter coat,"Beautiful coat, but I'm skeptical about its inclusion in the heavyweight category. In fairness, we haven't tested it in the snow and wind yet, but the fleece lining is only along the back and despite the puffy-style it is not very puffed with material.  My daughter will definitely need a sweater under it for the Dec - Feb months in Michigan.  Compared to a layered two-in-one coat, it is also a bit pricey.  As for the fit, it runs true-to-size. I originally bought a 6X (which is a size up from her clothing) with the intention of getting two seasons out of it; but given the thinness I re-ordered the 5-6, opting instead to focus on avoiding drafts this winter.  I likely would have returned the coat permanently if my decision was based simply on a stricter definition of a heavy winter coat, but my daughter absolutely loves the colors and design.  Also, the sleeves have elasticized cuffs so all-in-all, with some layering that includes a snow bib, I think it will be fine."

I bought a 3T so she'd have room to grow. It just barely fits. Shes 36.5"" and only 26lbs so well into the 2T measurement category. I almost need a 4t, a size she's never been close to wearing. Normally Osh Kosh clothing runs big and wide. So strange to me. None the less, it's an adorable coat."
1986,Michael,4.0,the United States ,"November 25, 2018",Beautiful but stains easily,"Bought this for my 6 year old daughter who loves anything rainbow.  This jacket is very stylish and warm and she loves it but there are two flaws that I have seen and that is the wrists do not have elastic which is not a deal breaker but it stains easily and shows every speck of dirt because of all of the light colors, other than that its great."

1996,Emily,5.0,the United States ,"November 21, 2021",Love This Coat!,"I purchased this for my four year old daughter since she was in need of a new winter coat. She loves how bright and pretty the colors are. This coat has also held up to the cold weather really well, so far! I would say it is of a medium weight (not too heavy, not too light.) and the zipper is fairly easy to operate. All in all, a really nice jacket!"
1997,Megan Mansfield,5.0,the United States ,"December 20, 2021",Love this coat.,So I made the personal mistake of ordering the jacket one size too big but other than that I absolutely love it I actually want to order one size smaller so it’ll actually fit the correct way but I know kids grow fast and mines will just grow into it it is super cute and very warm.
1998,Mary,5.0,the United States ,"November 16, 2018",Great deal!,"I just recieved this jacket for my 1.5 year old so this is my initial reaction review. I may change it as time goes on based on how it holds up.I purchased it in the size T2 and colour 'rainbow'. From the pictures I expected this to be all perfectly pastel and while thats true for the most part my only issue is with the hood colour. I was expecting a pastel coral, it's much more of a hot pink. This almost made me take a star off but I think that would of been unfair of me.My daughter loves it. We tried it on straight away and it fits perfectly with some room to grow (I'm hoping it'll fit next winter too). She didnt want to take it off, despite it being very thick and too warm to comfortably wear inside of a heated house. It feels like a big soft pillow and I've no doubt it'll keep out wind chill.As for wearing in the snow or rain I'm yet to find that out but I've very high hopes for it. Its a beautiful, thick and comfortable jacket at an absolutely wonderful price. Pictures to come later on."

2001,J&P Wilson,1.0,the United States ,"January 13, 2020",Not worn just washed and it pilled!,So trying to create that one of a kind hoodie for my niece and found this hoodie for a great price. I thought great kids' clothes can be so expensive and this is a great price. Once I received it I washed it along with 3 other hoodies that I received that day (of a different brand name) and nothing else with them. The other hoodies came out with no problems but this one pilled so horribly bad! I would advise that if you are using this other then a play shirt to spend the extra few bucks and try another brand before the Basic.
2002,Mlattire,1.0,the United States ,"January 23, 2022",Too small,There are no size charts for this sweatshirt on the site. I bought an extra large because typically an xl is 14-16 for kids. This was more of an 8!

2022,Vicky V,3.0,the United States ,"September 22, 2021",Runs quite small.,"My 12 yo is built slender.  Clothing is generally very roomy on her.  She was looking for a fall/winter pullover hoodie that would be baggy on her, so she could easily pull it on over other layers.  Based on the size chart and her measurements, the XX-Large should have fit the bill.  When she tried it on over a short sleeve tee shirt, it was form fitting.  So wouldn't work for the intended purpose.  I'm wondering if there was a mistake at the factory and they were mislabeled?  I've ordered quite a few pieces of clothing from the Amazon Essentials line, and so far, the sizing listed on the charts has been accurate.  So I'm not sure why this piece is so off.As for the quality of the item, it's REALLY nice.  The material is a nice weight, and the one we received is well sewn.  I believe it would have washed up nice and held up well.  My daughter wanted me to mention that if the fit had been correct, she would have loved it and wore it daily.  She said the material was very comfy and she loved the color.  We're really disappointed she can't wear it!"

I went back and looked at the stock photo and it also looks crooked so it must be intentional. However bc the slant is so slight it looks more like a print flaw. The heart is also much bigger than the stock photo. The only reason why I’m not returning is bc my kiddo wants to keep it. Size seems more on the smaller side. See photo, I purchased the size M.  She usually wears an M and it usually fits her loose but this one was perfect, so I would def. size up. If it weren’t for the crooked heart I probably would have given it 5 stars."

Wow I’m so happy it worked out.They are still longer in the length and arms for me, but not an issue.I can see this style may be bit slimmer side for girls who are still growing and becoming more female figure. The hoodie may be bit fitted than roomy. Not much of stretch in this.As far as the first impression, I think it’s good quality (I haven’t actually used or started wearing yet so will see…).I’m beyond excited to start wear from fall!"

But my daughter is almost 7 so I went up to size 8 as she would grow into them.  unfortunately they were HUGE!!! They look like they would fit a 12 year old.  I wanted to keep them until she grew into them but decided just to return them as it would be a long long time before that would happen.  The jeans themselves were cute but were a little more baggy than I would have imagined.  Not because they were big but because of the cut.  I'm afraid to order her actual size 6/7 as I'm afraid they'll still be baggy.  Maybe I should shop in store next time.  But we don't have any stores near to us.  The four pack seems super convenient and nice to have a variety of colors.  However; the fit is just really baggy and they run really big.

2073,Jaimee J.,3.0,the United States ,"May 22, 2022",Runs larger than regular skinny style,"We ordered the super skinny style and the basic skinny style both in size 12 slim.  The super skinny are a little more tapered at the ankle, but overall a lot bigger than the basic skinny, which I thought was a bit weird.  My daughter is tall and thin (about 5 ft, 65 lbs) and these were way too big in the waist, even with the adjustable waistband."
2074,Carrie Shaver,3.0,the United States ,"May 26, 2022",CUTE,"The pants are cute. They had a chemical type odor to them, not sure why. It almost looked like they were died black though."
2075,Brooke Crook,3.0,the United States ,"March 1, 2022","Good quality, but too large.",Definitely order a size smaller. I ordered these for my 10 and 6 year old girls and they were way too big and long for both girls. Material and quality are good though.
2076,MrsEFS,3.0,the United States ,"November 1, 2020",Too big and very thin,"I ordered 2 kinds of jeans from The Children's Place for my 5 yr old daughter who is tall and thin. One skinny and these which are super skinny, both in sz 6. They arrived today and I was really surprised by the fit. The skinny fit were a tiny bit loose (she could still wear them without a problem) but I think she'll grow into them over the next few months until they fit perfectly.The super skinny sz 6 are too long and waaaay to big! I held them up against the skinny jean and they are an inch larger in the waist and over 2 inches longer in the inseam. The entire fit was an entire size bigger. The material feels super thin as well. I'm keeping them for next year but I don't anticipate they will last more than a month or two before they develope a hole on the knee. Not to happy with this purchase."

2078,E. Dodd,3.0,the United States ,"June 17, 2020",Not Soft: But Fixable with Vinegar!!!,"These were very rough when I took them out of the package. I washed them to see if that would help. It helped a little bit, but not much. After some googling, I put my washer on pre-soak and soaked the jeans in white vinegar and let it sit for 30 min. Then I washed on a quick setting and added fabric softener. When I took them out, they didn't smell like vinegar. I dried them on low and WOW! What a difference! Now they are nice and soft and I feel comfortable giving to my daughter to wear. She's 7.5 about 50th percentile, and we got the 6x size - it's perfect, and it also has an adjustable waist band with buttons if you need it."
2079,Corrina Reid,3.0,the United States ,"March 10, 2021",Two different sizes for one size,"Be aware of the size. I ordered 3 pairs of pants and two were the same size and one pair was a inch smaller than the other sizes.I ordered the Black Wash Girls,  Dk Twilightwash and Victoria blue wash. The black pair was smaller and were tight on my daughter where the other ones were a little big on her which is what I wanted. All 3 were size 8 but the Black Wash was more like a size 6 instead of an 8"

2083,Bebe,4.0,the United States ,"September 30, 2022",Fits a bit large,The jeans are good quality and it’s wonderful that they have the adjustable pieces inside. My granddaughter is really petite so she absolutely needs to have them adjusted in the waist. The thighs are a bit baggy but they are okay!
2084,Chelsey mcbreairty,4.0,the United States ,"September 26, 2022",Great quality but larger than expected,"These are nice jeans/great quality, they just came much larger than I expected them to so my daughter won't be able to fit into them for another year or 2"

2090,Customer name,4.0,the United States ,"December 3, 2021",Great pants! Don't be led astray by the haters,"Boy I am happy I didn't pay attention to all the negative reviews on these pants! These pants are awesome, especially for the price! The skinny fit was a bit too skinny in the ankle area for my kiddos foot but the other styles fit perfectly. They have the nice band inside to tighten or loosen the waist, which is huge for me because my kids have long legs and a skinny waist. Don't be led astray from all the negative reviews."
