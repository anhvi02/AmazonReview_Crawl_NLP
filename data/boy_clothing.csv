0,Daniela,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 8, 2022",Very small size,"Its size according to its age is deceitful, the description of the size is confusing; since I bought one for a 9 year old and it fits a 4 year old. It also has a stiff weave."
1,Madeline,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 1, 2022",Size was too small,description for sizes was confusing..  My son is small for his age and I ordered size S because I figured it would be slightly on the big side.  I got underwear that fit better on my 4 year old daughter.  My son is a very skinny and short 60lb boy and S is usually his size.  Wish I would have ordered a M or even a L.
2,Kimberly Harris,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 19, 2022",Too small,Would have been perfect for someone else but was too small for my son
3,Shay,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022",Boys underwear,They are soft and comfortable.
4,Tee,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 28, 2022",No stretch/sizing off,I buy this brand often but first time from Amazon. They had no stretch or softness and I went according to size chart which is the size of all my son’s other boxers as well. I ordered L . Even outside the size they feel terrible on the skin
5,Sharon & Jen,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 9, 2022",SHRINKS HORRIBLY!,"Went ahead and ordered a size up since most of the reviews said they ran small...my son tried them on and said they seemed good, so I unpacked both packages purchased (20 pairs!!) and washed them in cool water and dried on low. THEY ALL SHRUNK! My son cannot wear them now and I cannot return them since I do not have them in the original packaging. I have never had a Hanes product shrink so badly! Seriously disappointed and now out $33...UGH!!"
6,Akram Hussain shaikh,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 27, 2022",Size is Fake,I order Large size but I receive size like a kid I cannot put my leg inside size is fake I wasted my money to buy this product in future I will not suggest any one to buy this product from Amazon otherwise you waste your money😔😔😔
7,Ada,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 4, 2022",Wrong size arrived,"Way too big. Says boys, came in men size"
8,MrsO837,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 12, 2022","Arrived stuffed into a bag, one *looks* new","Tried getting a refund on these boys underwear as they look used and ARE likely a return. They were stuffed into a clear bag and tossed into the box with the rest of my order *more underwear and socks as well. Tossing the Hanes knowing I won't get my money back. Better than another parent buying someone's discards, I guess."
9,Whitney White,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 31, 2022",Disappointed,My 7 year normally wears a size 10 in shorts/underwear. I ordered him a size large in these underwear due to reviews. However they run extremely small and shrink more than expected after one wash. Disappointed!
10,S.M.S.,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 3, 2022",Size Chart Incorrect.  Runs very small. Size up!!,Bought mediums for my 8 year old based on the provided size chart and they are too small.  Unfortunately my husband had unpacked them so I can't return and I doubt he will be able to get them on. For reference both in picture are Hanes MEDIUM…gray ones are these. Way too small!
11,Janice Miller ,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 27, 2022",Size up,These fit small so be sure to size up at least one size.
12,leah camacho,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 5, 2022",Runs small,I was warned to buy larger. Fitting guidelines said my kid would fit the size medium according to his measurements. But for the weight he barely tipped into the large.  So I sided on the bigger size. He's too big for even the larger size up I purchased. He says they squeeze his booty too much. They look cheap too. Like all the seams will pop if they get tight.
13,Amber,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 18, 2021",Sizing is way off..  in my case anyways!,"My son wears a small/medium in boxers and pants. I usually get him a small in boxer briefs because they fit perfectly, but because I was ordering online.. I figured I'd go up a size, just in case. Well, they're still too small! The leg holes are very tight, and the waste doesn't have much stretch! So upset. The softness and style of them is exactly what I wanted for my son, but he is just too uncomfortable in them. I can't see returning underwear, because it's just weird.  So, I guess I'm stuck with 10 pairs of boxer briefs that don't fit. My son is 6 years old, wears a size 6-8 in clothing depending on brand. He is average weight, about 50inches in height, for reference. I can't imagine what they would be like after going through a dryer. Perhaps next time I will size up to a large,  or choose another style all together."
14,crynone,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 4, 2022",Don’t use sz chart,"My son is 11, long and lean. I originally ordered Medium size…waaay too small. Then I ordered Large…way too small…not sure if I will continue to order these. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
15,LOTOYA,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 13, 2022",Way to small,I’ve selected size 10-12 yrs … they can fit my 11months old nephew. Not for kids that are 8yr .

19,KHP,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 21, 2021",Too small.,"(Photo shows large black pair underneath and new x-large ones on top.)I ordered these for two growing boys ages 10 and 11 and I swear they were smaller than the ones I bought them to replace and it got worse after the first wash! Unfortunately, cannot recommend. Only giving two stars in case I made a mistake in size when ordering, but pretty sure I got either the large or extra large. (Update- I checked and I ordered the x-large!)"
20,Jagmichael,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 28, 2022",Snug,My son is 5 and weighs 45 pounds.  He’s 46 inches tall.  23 inch waist.  I ordered a small but they are very tight on his waist.  I would order a size up next time.
21,SMM,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022",Only 8 in this 10 pack,"When I opened this package, I found only 8 pairs instead of the advertised 10. It wasn’t worth returning, but just be aware."
22,Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 18, 2022",Small but cozy,Order a size or two up. I ordered 10/12 for my very tall/slender 6 yr old who regularly wears a size 8. They were still slightly tight but usable so we kept them.

25,Robert Zafuto,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 17, 2022","If you want stretch, keep looking.","At least 4 pairs in this pack are unwearable because the patterned material used has ZERO stretch, they won't go above his knees. The plain color pairs are soft and comfortable. Very disappointed that we didn't discover this before he had already worn a few pair."
26,Sam O,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 22, 2022",These run small!,"These run small small small. My son wears an 8 in pants and shorts but I read the reviews that these run small, so instead of getting a medium (8-10), I got a large (12-14). I was really nervous doing so because 12 is usually a bit far from 8 but I trusted the reviews. They barely fit. I washed them in warm water and dried on low heat like I do with all my clothing. They fit just barely. I would return if I hadn’t already washed them, and I have a younger boy who can wear them. But I would size up twice next time if I was to purchase again."
27,Sassy B,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 18, 2022",Not as expected,They are ok but a little tight.

My child wears a 10/12 and they are tight. As far a comfortable he loves them. They are also soft.  Would recommend just know how you child likes his boxers. If they like loose order up.

39,Amanda,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 13, 2022",Thought they might be too big….,"There is no size chart in the post for this product. I ordered medium expecting it to be 7/8 after reading the answered questions. It actually has 10/12 on the package. I thought I’d be returning these because they would be too big. I opened the ziplock package and took a pair out to size them up next to my son. They look like they would fit him fine, especially if they shrink just a bit. He wears a 7/8 in clothing. He is 9 years old 53.5 inches tall and 64lbs. Bottom line is that these seem to run small. Hope this helps!"
40,Cali,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 28, 2022",Our go-to value boxer briefs for my son,"Exactly as advertised. Every time my son goes up a size we reorder these boxer briefs for him in his new size. Underwear is very much a personal decision on what a person expects of them, but for my son, these are his go to.The sizing is consistent and accurate to the size chart and the value of how many you get in a pack is important for us when choosing underwear. My son has never once complained about this brand or lack of comfort. They do have elastic waist band and the legs are a basic stretchy cotton. I will say they appear to sometimes get baggy around the legs at the end of the day and don’t continually offer “compression” but again, my son has never complained, so it meets my expectations. I haven’t had an issue with shrinking or anything either. They do become faded over time and definitely don’t look new forever, but again, it’s boys underwear, who is going to see it?My son is tall and on the slimmer side and these work well. I usually by his pants in slim, but he isn’t a true “bean pole” type either. I’m not sure how these would fit on ultra skinny or heavier set boys but they are stretchy.Pros-Price per pairConsistentcomfortable (so I’ve been told)Cons-Maybe the elastic waist band for someColor fades after many washes."
41,Bobbie,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 5, 2022","Good fit, comfy for my son","Not a ton of stretch but it's there. My son says it's comfortable & he loves the patterns. He's a solid kid, normally a size 10 & we ordered the large size with it fitting perfect."

I wanted some for him to transition into so I purchased the next size up, which were these in XL (14/16) They are so small we can't even get them up half past his calves!! I already washed them not thinking they wouldn't fit!! I'm out the money and stuck with underwear that wouldn't be tight on a toddler! Now he will have to wait a month till I get paid to buy some that fit! I won't be buying this brand or for this buyer!"
51,Whitney Kaufman,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 28, 2022",Arrived in a sloppy mess,Giving one start because the underwear had been opened. The package was torn and sloppy. Underwear had obviously been taken out and returned or something… not impressed

53,Tellisto,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 17, 2022",Nice but too small,"The fabric seems nice but my biggest issue is my 4yr old could not fit the SMALL.  Small can fit my 18 month old.

Buying things like the underwear we always buy online saves us time. Do yourselves a favor and don't waste any on these. 5 of 6 pairs were unraveled, a complete seam gone on the red pair (see pic). Are these even really Hanes?"
56,Cindy S.,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 5, 2022",Looked great but first wash destroyed them.,After the very first wash there were long threads everywhere that came out from the stitching along the leg holes. So the legs are unraveling to the raw cut edges already. Pretty disappointed.

A little difficult to see on the blue ones. My son has worn these once after initial wash. Very disappointed with the quality.

71,Rglowe,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 21, 2022",Would be great but,These would be great except they are way too small. My son wears a small but after reading the reviews I ordered up and for these in a medium. They are still too small! It’s like there isn’t enough length in them. They aren’t too tight but they barely cover his butt crack and look super uncomfortable.

73,S. Sandy,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 5, 2022",Great until they snag,"The kid likes these. They fit well, the fabric is soft, and they seem to come up a little higher in back, preventing occasional plumber's crack.  However, they've been washed three times and worn twice and already have runs, snags, and holes. I've never had such delicate underwear. I washed on cold, in a front loader. To keep these nice might require hand washing, which is not really something I want to do with boys underwear."

80,The Wymans,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 31, 2022",Too small with Minimal stretching,"Super cute and we were hopeful for a good fit. Sadly for my 10yo the XL was too small. The XL is a size 18-20 I believe which in my mind should fit pretty well. They fit him on the smaller side with minimal stretch. Cooper just turned 10 in August but is 105 lbs and 5’11 and has a good size bum. (Btw Dad is 6’4 so I’m assuming Cooper isn’t done growing) I figured if I added his size that would be helpful. I think if your child was smaller, these would be a great pair of underroos!  Btw-We ended up buying another brand as well 1 pack of  “5MAYI” Mens Small. (Also available on Amazon) They fit and feel amazing he said. I agreed seeing them on him. Just thought I would include the positive too about a good fitting pair for a larger/taller child."

98,ARC,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 6, 2022",These will always be my go-to for my little guys!,"We've now purchased several packs of these for our boys from sizes small to large (and about to order XL). We've never had a single problem with even 1 pair and they've gone from my oldest son, to my youngest, and now to another kid. Normally, I'd think that's absolutely gross... but these have never stained, wash and dry extremely well (our washing and drying routine should be brutal on clothes--lots of high heat in both). I wash all of our clothes with peroxide poured into the bleach slot. These all look brand new always. Very very very pleased and my sons love them! They're the only ones we've used that just fit right with no worries. Good coverage, but good stretch--never tight. Zero complaints from this Mama of 2 boys!"

I have bought them in the past and my son loved them but these are different. They don’t have any cotton in them and are not breathable which means sweaty, stinky feet. After 3 days I can’t stand them and I bought new socks."
103,Christina Snyder,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 8, 2021",Seam is a hot mess,"I ordered these for my son. He HATES them. The seam on the inside is all weird, has tons of little 'hairs' or pieces of material hanging off the seam, so they just stuck between his toes and tickle/itch his toes. Totally weird feeling. At first I thought my son was crazy, but when I turned them inside out and saw what he was complaining about - I wouldn't wear them either. Wish I could return them, but I really disregarded his complaint for the first two weeks we had them, so now I had to order new better ones, and am stuck throwing these away."
104,Kari,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 5, 2022",Immediately frayed. Paper thin.,I do not suggest Buying these socks. I wish I had not. They have immediately started to fray and pull. If I put my hand in the sock I can see through it. Will be returning
105,M Taylor,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 2, 2021",Terrible Quality - Falling Apart,"I'm shocked at how quickly these socks are falling apart with normal wear. My son mostly just wears these around the house and has already gotten 3 holes, plus a lot of pilling of the material. We've had these for only a few months and they look awful.Edited to add: I've reduced my rating from 2 stars to 1. These socks really are the worst we've ever bought - every single one of them has holes. I'm even more disappointed considering these are from Fruit of the Loom... these are such low quality!"
106,jennifer,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 30, 2022",Terrible socks!,Didn’t even have these for 2 months. After first wash they became gross and grosser. Not sure if it where ever they are coming from but will go to the store and purchase hanes now
107,New Mom,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 20, 2021",Unravel quickly,"My 6 year old loves these socks. They are soft and fit well, but like other reviewers we’ve found they unravel quickly and way too easily. As in, he stood on a plastic stool and snagged a hole in not one but two pairs. Would not waste the money as we’ve had these for a mere two weeks."
108,Jessi,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 15, 2020",Sizing not accurate,"My 4 year old wears between size 12 shoes... These socks were advertised to fit shoe size 9.5-2, so he should have fallen right in the middle of that size range, and they are huge.  My 10 year old wears a size 3 shoe and they are even too big on him.  I washed them in hot water and dried on high heat hoping they'd shrink some and no luck.  Now I also can't return.  Not satisfied with this purchase whatsoever."

112,Jessica,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 30, 2022",Sweaty little feet.....,These socks are good for keeping feet warm but i wouldn't recommend them for wearing them with shoes. After a day of light walking or running in shoes my son feet are sweaty. The socks make your kids feet sweat and stay wet. I know it is my son's socks not shoes because he has socks by a different brand that we have no issues with.
113,Matthew Reardon,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 17, 2021","Soft Feel, Good Fit, Poor Quality","These socks were initially a hit. They are soft to the touch, fit well, had some fun colors on the toe and heel, and were easy to get on (for a five year old). However, only a few weeks into them and there are threads coming off  of the toe and bottom like the sock is unraveling. I don't expect these socks to make it more than another few weeks before there are holes as a result."

120,Charmain Sweat,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 28, 2022",The Socks are very small,The socks ended up being much smaller than ordered. I ordered the size for a ten yt old but there so small they fit a 3 year old. So I just gave them away 🤷🏾‍♀️
121,Kelly,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 6, 2021",Just OK,"This product functions well enough, but didn't hold up well at all after one cycle through the laundry. All of the socks started to string and pill immediately, looking quite tattered. I would say my son is an average sock wearer. We rarely leave the house these days so he wears them around the house mostly. It certainly doesn’t affect the function, as he’s a typical boy who doesn’t care if his socks have little strings or fuzzies. If you have a more sensitive kiddo, the inside of the socks have quite a bit of fuzz/string that might be problematic for someone with sensory issues."
122,Meg,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 17, 2021",Sub-par,"I have bought a few sets of socks off amazon, and they all seem poorer quality than what I would get in a store. They seem fine when I open them, but after one wash they already look dingy and have many strings coming off. They aren’t falling apart, but already don’t look new. I think I’ll go back to brick and mortar stores for socks. I don’t know why there is a difference!"
123,Mark T.,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 28, 2021",The toe seam is really stiff,"I would have kept these socks other than the fact that the toe seam was so stiff.  I washed 1 pair to see if it would soften, but it did not.  I was surprised as FOTL should be in the business long enough to not have an issue as basic as that.  Sending them back."
124,Dana C.,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 16, 2019",Meh- they work,"Bought these for my 4yr old. Sizing is about right. Colors are fun and vibrant, socks are soft and cozy- he loves them. As a parent- they won't last long. I washed them and they were already pilling and had some pulling strings. Then add in him actually wearing them and they look more like socks that he has had for some time instead of new ones that were just bought. So they work, and they might last through the winter and until he can go back to sandals in late spring but only time will really tell."
125,Megan Wyatt,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 18, 2020",Too big and falling apart,I bought the Medium for my little boy who wears toddler size 10. They are way too big.

126,T. Gale,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 21, 2020",pretty thin socks,"I don't expect these socks to last very long. They're very thin.  I also purchased t another brand at the same time that were more expensive, but I am very happy with those.  These aren't terrible, but you get what you pay for."

I feel like the ones you'd but at Walmart or target are better quality even though they are the same brand. The bottom of the sock is nice and soft but the top of the foot area is thin and rough feeling.  I actually bought two different big-brand packages for my son and had the same issue with both.  Super disappointed.

I would have given them 5 stars, but so far my son has had around 6 pairs to unravel at the top. That makes the sock have a giant hole in it and it is useless then!! I’m already about to have to buy him socks again because of this problem."

134,Erin Matheson Hoy,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 9, 2020",Good socks for kids,"Good socks, only reason they didnt get a 5 star is because they still put the plastic tag on them that holds together the socks even though they are in a bag. Subsequently they snagged several pairs of socks. I guess I just didnt see the point of the plastic tags when they are in a bag."
135,Ryan Elofson,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 27, 2020",Should last a few months,"Nice and comfy, but not durable. After only a few wears I'm seeing strings emerge from the toes.

136,K. Goode,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 11, 2020",On the thin side,"The socks were a little thinner than I was expecting but not in a cheap way.  They washed up find and fit my son who wears a size 12 toddler shoe just fine.  For the price and so far the quality shown, these were a good buy."

Maybe it's just stiff from being new and will get easier.Buying toddler clothing is also frustrating because they will grow out of it quickly, so having something on this jacket that didn't fit right means they'll mostly outgrow the jacket sooner than thought - but if we got the next size up then the arms would be even longer and still not fit right."

I bought a size larger for my teenager to grow into, anticipating continued inflation.  The picture was of beautiful hues of greens and blues.  What arrived were a strange assortment of colors, stripes, and two pairs of designs that had electric guitars and what look like WALKMANS on them.  I know they are just underwear but the pictures were misleading and these are altogether unacceptable.  How do I know they were from 2016 (or before)?  There was a coupon for undershirts in the one package, and it expired in 2016.  I mean, that's sort of funny, but the designs are something for which I would literally NEVER pay good money."

The stripes are cheaply made stitching is all over the place and the fabric cuts are awful compared to the solids. The stripes package said made in Honduras the solids package said made in El Salvador. The material on the stripes is 75% cotton the rest is polyester which I hate! The solids are 100% cotton and they all look great and feel soft. I’m really disappointed in the quality of the striped boxer briefs!!
165,Ayeah ,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 28, 2022",Rough and caused irritation!,"This was a really bad product. The material was rough and the actually inside stitching was even more tough that it caused my son to have bad rotation and redness and he would even complain about how it bothering him.

 Good and well-made, my youngest two sons out of five sons complain about the fabric in the front being too stiff on their package. So I soaked them in Wool lite  for the weekend and they don’t seem to complain as much about the stiffness on their junk anymore. So if you have a sensitive little boy be cautious on the front being thick and rubbing on their parts 😬🤭 you’ll see in the video I have the underwear inside out to show the areas of stiffness and the sizes vary with complaints. My six-year-old complains about the smalls because how chunky that fabric is cut along the edging and my seven year old complains about the front just being too stiff in general.  I normally only buy Hanes."

Half of the boxer briefs fit perfectly and my son is happy with the fit and comfort, however the other half had almost no stretch and the bottoms of the leg holes were so tight he couldn't even get them on.  I have never encountered this before and have been buying my husband and son Hanes for years.  I have to say with the price of underwear I am incredibly upset my son can't even wear half of them!  Having to go to a big box store to pick up underwear for him, since I only ended up with 3 pairs, was also a headache I did not need.

I made him try them on in front of me and he could barely get it up his left leg, he previously wore 8's and outgrew them so naturally just went up a size but this material is awful and has no give or stretch.

I mean yeah they are soft until you wash them and he says they ride up his legs constantly when he's running and jumping at camp. So onto find different ones.

Cooper just turned 10 in August but is 105 lbs and 5’11 and has a good size bum. (Btw Dad is 6’4 so I’m assuming Cooper isn’t done growing) I figured if I added his size that would be helpful. I think if your child was smaller, these would be a great pair of underroos!  Btw-We ended up buying another brand as well 1 pack of  “5MAYI” Mens Small. (Also available on Amazon) They fit and feel amazing he said. I agreed seeing them on him. Just thought I would include the positive too about a good fitting pair for a larger/taller child."

I got them for tie dye and painting on. My 6 year old son usually wears a 7 and according to other reviews I purchased a larger size than I needed to accommodate for shrinking. I included pictures of the package sizing, of before washing- straight  from the package, and of after washing on a delicate setting with cold water and drying on low heat. Hopefully, the measurements on the pictures will help someone to see how much they shrink so you can purchase the right size."

I ordered size medium for my 8 year old son, who is not petite, and I can see that once they shrink in the wash, they will be too small.

We purchased these in a size medium which is for 10 - 12 year-olds.  Smalls are for 6 - 8 years so what are 8 - 10 year-olds supposed to do?  We bought these and they are fine in the chest and arms but very long in length.  I'm sure once he's 10 they'll fit fine but for now they are too long and hang below all of his shirts.  He'll continue to wear them but if you have a kid in that in-between size you might want to check other brands to see how their fitment is.  I would buy again once he's a bit older/taller and they fit better.

However, probably this is not the case if your child does not insist on wearing them every day for 8 years. I wish they were cheaper. Sometimes I find cheaper pairs on ebay.

After the coldwater wash they are perfect.Room to grow and long enough to cover bellybutton. Good luck.

The olive green color is perfect. Unfortunately only two hours in the snow and the jacket was soaked. It even went through the jacket and made my sons clothes wet as well. Bummed. :(

It wasn't until my son pointed out that the buttons were missing on one side of the jacket preventing it from closing up that I realized we aren't the first owmers. Im not sure about everyone else here but I'm certain I ordered my son's jacket brand new but apparently ""L. Ercolano"" begs to differ."
435,SAHMof3,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 8, 2021",Sleeves sewn shut!!!,"This jacket is a joke.  We opened it up so our son could try it on. He could not get his arm in the sleeves. We looked at and tried to put an arm in and the sleeves are either sewn shut partially or there is a button inside the stupid sleeves preventing him from putting it on.We turned the sleeves inside out,  messed with each one and were only able to get one ""open"" all the way,  the other his hand partially through the sleeves.This is beyond irritating.  Who sews a sleeves closed?This is going back! Do not buy this."

438,Pamela L.,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 11, 2022",Falls apart fast!!,"This coat arrived on a Monday, my son wore it for 2.5 days before I the zipper broke. The fabric is so thin and flimsy it ripped during this same time. I will be sending this back defective and asking for a refund."
439,Brian Choj,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 12, 2021",Delivered filthy,The weather is starting to change so I decided to try the Amazon essential jacket for my son upon arrival the jacket looked worn and dirty.

440,rbf247,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 30, 2022","Came damaged, good alternative to heavy winter coat","Jacket arrived with tear in hood. It looks like it was mis-sewn. Of course, it was unseasonably cold the next morning, so I sent my child to school in it anyway. Aside from that, it’s a lightweight alternative to big winter coat."
441,vivian mott,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 6, 2022",coat ripped on seam after being worn about 6 weeks,"I am disappointed with this purchase because I bought 2 of them back in September as Christmas gifts for my grandchildren, it was not even worn till after December 28, 2021. Unfortunately the return window was closed in October. On February 4.2022 the coat ripped on the seam under the arm and down the side and you can see it is going to continue to come apart. The second coat is fine, this is clearly a manufacturers defect. It’s disappointing I cannot get an exchange on this barely worn coat being it was warm, lightweight, water resistant and the child really liked it. Especially since you can clearly see the stitching is coming apart. Therefore I suggest if you purchase this coat USE it immediately!"
442,Rose C.,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 8, 2022",Loved it until seams started ripping,"Ordered this in a size bigger to ensure it would fit over sweaters, snowpants, and all other winter finery. Kept my son warm and comfortable for two months, until the seams started giving out. First, the seam under the arm came undone and resulted in a blown seam down the side that measured 4 inches long. Now the seam of a front panel is coming undone. I mended them in an attempt to get it to last the season. I've never seen a jacket do this before. This seemed like the perfect winter coat, please beef up the quality control for next year."
443,Frank A.,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 3, 2022",Good jacket but inner sleeve sown twisted,I bought two sizes because I was unsure of the fit. The medium jacket came with the inner sleeve sewn twisted and my son could not get his arm thru. The large jacket fit fine and looks to be a good coat.
444,Jonathan Miles,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2020","thin fabric poor quality, will not hold up to daily use","Coat arrived fine. Blue color is nice, same as picture. XS was a good fit for for a boy size 5; possibly get two seasons out of it. Kid liked the thumb holes, of course!Issue is with the quality of materials. Very thin fabric on outside and did not hold up to one use by out 3.5 year old. Fabric ripped on back and stuffing coming out. Will try and sew, but does not bode well for the jacket's long term future. Definitely experiencing some buyer's remorse, first time buying Amazon brand. In hindsight I would have purchased a different higher quality brand/jacket.Update: Second time wearing the jacket, the stitching on hood came undone in one spot and again stuffing coming out. Nice looking jacket, but unfortunately poor quality (material and workmanship)."
445,lori,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 6, 2019",Terrible odor,"First, I have to say the quality of the Amazon Basic products are top notch.  I ordered snow pants with the matching coats for both my kids.  We had snow, so they became early Christmas gifts.  Great fit, true to size, and warm for the cold, snowy weather.  However, my son’s coat was the only one not in plastic wrap when we opened the box.  It looked fine with tags in tack, but smelled funny.  I figured it would be fine once he wore it and the air hit it.  Nope.  Still there.  Washed it.  Still there.  Soaked it and washed it.  Still there.  He won’t wear it now and I can’t return it since it has been worn and washed.  But we love the coat.  Not to mention have the matching pants that have also been worn."
446,LMe,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 5, 2022",Poor quality,Didn't hold up even one winter. Sticking already separated in on sleeve. Poor quality.
447,Cassie,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 22, 2020",Great but..,I really loved the features the coat offered and everything but one day my son came home with his coat open in freezing degree weather.  I couldn't figure out for the life of me why it was open and not zipped. Eventually we found that somehow the zipper piece that buttons at the bottom with the other side was bent or pushed in.  I have a tough time believing my 70lb 9 year old did anything to bend the zipper itself so I'm stumped. Really love the jacket but it will ultimately be useless now that we can't zip it.
448,Happy Camper,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 16, 2019",Polyester outer tears too easily,This coat is a good buy. Warm for New England winters. Body and hood lined with fleece. Waist snaps inside coat to keep snug. Also has cuffs with thumb hole. Would purchase again. I usually purchase oshkosh this is just as good or better.Update: My sons coat got caught on a branch and created a large tear in the front to the coat. Really disappointing. Compared to the Amazon essentials snowpant I would say the fabric quality just isn't there like it is with the snow pants which seem to be much more durable.
449,Heather,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 14, 2019",This coat rips easily,Initially I thought this was a very nice jacket and for the most part it is.  It’s warm and comfortable.  However my problem is the fabric rips very easily which is frustrating since it’s designed for kids.  My son isn’t overly reckless and wild but he is a typical kid and we’ve only had the coat for about two weeks and the outer fabric has ripped in several places.  For this reason I am ver disappointed in this coat.
450,Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 23, 2022",button broke,"button came apart 1st time it was used, other wise a good jacket."
451,Rebecca Snoeyink,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 21, 2022",Ok but def not waterproof,"This coat is just ok. My kid tells me that sometimes he's cold while wearing it. And if he's playing in the snow at all, he gets wet. It is no where near waterproof and is only just as water resistant as anything made of swishy material would be. Wish I would have spent the extra money to get a better quality coat."
452,Jono89,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 20, 2021",My son seems happy and warm,"My son just turned 9 and is small for his age, fitting into size 8 things well, and size 9 is too large still.This coat fit him perfectly in the arm length. The body length is a bit longer than expected. The inside, ""around the body"" snap-waistband is quite large on him; I think it was supposed to help keep snow and cold from going up his back, but this will be useless on him.Overall a good product, but I'm not sure if it's worth 40 something bucks. Definitely 30 something. If this lasts 2 winters, I'll change my mind."
453,aea42283,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 3, 2022",Great coat but a huge hole is not what you want in January,"Love this coat and absolutely in love with the thumb holes in the sleeves. My boys have worn these for close to a month and all of a sudden today I found a huge gaping hole in the coat, right where the sleeve meets the coat. Not very happy this happened at all. I would keep a close eye on the seems"
454,shelly,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 26, 2021",Cute but not durable,"Cute and warm but not for backyard play, my son's ripped and the fabric doesn't allow for patches. Wound up buying a Carhartt coat. If your kid isn't a rough and tough kid this will be fine though."
455,Casandra ,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 30, 2021",Nice jacket for 3 yr old.,Nice jacket for my 3 yr old boy. Definitely take it off before putting into a car seat. It’s way too big which isn’t safe. I would buy again for the price.
456,CandG,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 23, 2021","Decent for the price, but the fabric tears easily.","So, for the price, I’m fairly pleased with it. The design is simple and works well. The color options are good options for little ones. It’s warm and fairly water resistant (though it does get damp if exposed for long periods). However, the fabric tears easily. I think we will only be getting one season out of it. If you aren’t looking to hand it down, you should be good. The easy tearing is the only reason for my rating. Other than that we were pleased."

458,jvic,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 2, 2020",Well made.  Does what it is supposed to do.,"**UPDATE- 1 year laterThe stitching around the pocket came undone, and a bunch of the stuffing fell out. Before that happened, the stuffing started to move around inside the coat, so there were parts of the coat that were just fabric, with no stuffing. I guess it was kind of silly for me to think we would get more than one year out of a $45 coat. It was good for most of that year, though.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I got this for my 7 year old son.  He loves it.  It seems to be well-made.  I would definitely purchase this again."
459,KC,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 19, 2019","Well made, but too wide","The jacket seemed well made, and I liked the snaps and thumbhole sleeves (toddler didn't care for them though). Unfortunately, the 2T sleeves were way too long on my 23-month-old and the body was was too wide, yet on the short side -- it wouldn't have trapped any of his body heat to keep him warm in the cold. Maybe the bigger sizes would fit an older kid, but the 2T wasn't a good fit for my little one."
460,Maegan Cockrell,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022","Runs big, but great otherwise!","This coat seems super warm. It has a band inside to keep it tight at the bottom so wind doesn't blow inside the coat, which I love! It also has thumb holes on the inner sleeve, so it will keep the sleeves from riding up, if your kiddo will keep their thumbs in the holes. The only issue is that it runs pretty big. My son's 2T coat was starting to get a bit small, so I bought a 3T, and it is huge on Jim. Otherwise, this coat is fantastic, totally exceeded my expectations for the price."
461,Kim Savino,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022",Great jacket- came used,"I purchased this jacket for my son- it’s great but I noticed when I opened it, it was dirty. There was snot on the sleeve , clearly from a toddler using the jacket and wiping their nose. Not happy about that since I purchased the jacket “new” and with the colds, illness, sickness going around I did not appreciate that. Obviously I washed the jacket before use but I should not have to start with a dirty used jacket when purchasing it new."

468,Kate,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 20, 2019",Good everyday mid-weight coat for Midwest winters.,"This is a great mid-weight coat.  I bought this in size 3T for my little guy who just turned two but is quite tall at 36” and 30lbs. The coat he’s wearing now is year’s coat amd js almost too small, so I ordered this knowing it would be a bit large.  I’m hopping this one will get us through the end of this winter and maybe next fall.  We live in the Midwest and winters are harsh, but this is warm enough for everyday usage.  The fleece lining is really soft and cozy.  I like the cuffs at the wrist, they are soft and easy to get toddler hands in and out but tight enough to keep warm.  I also bought a girls one for my 6 year old, she says it is perfect for recess because it is easy to move in and not bulky.  We haven’t have super cold or deep snow yet.  Overall I’m happy with these coats!"

Even though he’s a size medium in hoodies we’ve bought and in shirts I went with a small. You can never depend on these size charts. A reviewer wrote their sons height, weight and size they bought said it fit great. That was very helpful because my grandson was an inch shorter and couple pounds lighter. The way sizes goes one size has always been too small and the next too large. So very happy the coat fits well. Seems warm and is soft, he loves the finger holes. Hopefully it stands up to wear. Btw he’s 49” tall and 49 lbs got the size small. Oh and the size chart was good but wasn’t trusting it."
471,Avery Jessup,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 5, 2022",Surprisingly warm and quality features,This is a real winter coat! Not too heavy but very warm with features like thumb holes in the sleeves and inner buttons to seal the liner at the bottom. Could definitely work as a ski / snowboard jacket. Only had it a few days so I can't speak to the durability but so far I'm impressed for sure.Got it for my son who's 3.5 years. He's normally a 3T/4T but I ordered the XS to hopefully get a few seasons. It's a little big for now but in a cute way and definitely wearable.
472,Sara Geishecker,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",Super cozy!,"We had to replace a jacket that had a wonky zipper, and this coat popped up as an option. My almost 8 year old loves how soft and comfortable it is, and he especially loves how he can tuck his thumbs through the fabric at the end of the sleeves. It has an easy zipper and washes easily. We bought this larger so there's room to grow, and will definitely have it for a couple years. Wonderful coat!"

Since the season was half over, we were having a hard time finding anything decent in his size. Enter Amazon. This coat is awesome. Very warm, durable, keeps snow out. We suddenly had freezing cold weather this fall and fortunately this coat was still in the closet and fits him. Kept him warm and dry on a snowy and windy 19 degree day! Beyond worth the low cost.It is pretty puffy, which some may not like, but it's very warm. XS says it's a 4/5 but it's long enough for our tall kiddo who is in a 5 or 6 in most other brands. Plenty of room to layer too."

I didn’t wanted to spend over $100 on a coat we would wear just for that trip. This coat was warmer and nicer and cuter than I expected. Really great for the price and I would say rivals high end brands. The double zipper and buttons were easy to use for my 8 year old. He stayed really warm in 20 degree weather. I would definitely buy again.

He said they were too small. I handed them over to his average sized 7 year old brother and they fit him well - they were snug even. So I ordered this larger size and they came and are HUGE (probably size appropriate). Watch out with the sizing on these."

The package I received IS a LARGE, but these are a size 14-16!! It would be nice if your size charts were accurate.Also sending back too large T-shirts that had the SAME, incorrect size chart."
532,La,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 31, 2020",Threads loosen and hang after one wear.,"First of all, these fit my 5 y/o son snugly- they don't have a loose fit like I expected them to have, which, in my opinion, defeats the purpose of ""breathable"" material. Secondly, every time my son wears a pair of these, strings/thread start loosening up and hanging from them- after ONE wear!! These underwear are WHACK!!"
533,ALEX,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 7, 2020",Knock-offs,"I bought this same exact pack, same size from Target a month before buying these. I went ahead and bought an extra pack just to have, but they are way smaller than what their size says. I have pictures to show the difference, but for some reason am unable to post them.

535,J,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 20, 2019",Unfortunately not what I expected from Hanes,I don't recommend these at all. I've used Hanes before and like that brand.The problem with these in particular is that the band around the thighs is rigid instead of elastic or stretchy. So when you sit you will feel tightness around your thighs which is extremely uncomfortable.I ended up stretching them with my hands until I heard a rip. At that point they became usable.It's a shame because Hanes was my go-to standard for Boxer Briefs until this happened.
536,EEJA,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 16, 2020",Too tight and not soft enough,"The fabric is not elastic enough and soft enough, especially the waist, which is too tight to make it uncomfortable, so compared to this price, it is not satisfactory. Actually it is really strange, the inner thread of pants is tough than the outside thread, that's why it looks better but Wearing it feels not good."
537,D. Jackson,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 23, 2020",Horrible Material- which is not typical,"For some reason these were not as soft and comfortable as the Hanes underwear I have purchased in the past for my son.

I even went a size up for my son and these are way too small. I should have gone up two sizes. I got a medium (fits like small) for my son who weighs 68 pounds at nearly 5 years old.
542,Nancy Evans,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 1, 2020",Watch sizes,"I ordered Medium boys and the packaging said medium.  However, the label on the underwear said XL.  Good thing he is growing so I will keep them for the future.  He will probably be in high school before he can wear them."
543,Tararaa,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 31, 2019",Stinks,Sizing was a little off but the main issue was the smell. It took several washes with heavily scented laundry products to get rid of a strong odor that was emanating from these undergarments. Tag on packaging said “made in India”. Found same product in a store for slightly more money and was more satisfied.
544,Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 24, 2022","Would be nice, but they get stretched out soon after putting on","The fabric feels really soft and nice at first, but soon after putting them on, they get stretched out and baggy.

They are also tagless, ( my grandson hates tags )  and the new breathable mesh is great for the humid New England summers and fall.  They don't stretch out of shape either.  Highly recommend."

I bought him a large since he's about 5'1"" and 95 pounds and likes to wear baggy things. The large was almost small on him but luckily he was ok with it. It kept the water out on his hikes in the rain. It's very thin so if you're expecting cold weather you need to pack layers to go under.

The Large is a little big on him, but he runs small (12% on height and weight charts) and it gives him plenty of room to grow.  The quality is great and feels sturdy without being rubbery.  We have not yet had a chance to test out the waterproofing, but being a good brand that I trust, I imagine that won't be an issue.  It is a thin jacket.  I don't think it will provide much warmth other than keeping him dry and blocking the wind, but it will be perfect over a sweatshirt for the cooler days.  I liked it so much that I returned the ""cutesy"" raincoat I bought my 4 year old and bought a second one of these in a size Small for him!"

Well, we got that snow two weeks ago, and the snap broke the first time my kid put them on.  Then all of my kids refused to wear the pair with a broken snap.  (kids!)  I finally got to a point to return them, and I'm outside my return window by 2 weeks.  Bummer.  Besides the snap breaking off, they work well.  We bought 2 pair, and the other pair so far is fine.  I'll probably find some Velcro or something to attach to the pants."

My son is 6 and wears sz 8-10.  He is on the higher percentile for height and weight but proportional.  I bought sz Medium as reviews stated that would be sz 10-12 which seems right.  Small wound have been to tight. He walks on the bottoms of the snow pants because the of the length.  Waist fits him well. Sturdy material and good price.  Over all decent snow pants.  I am sure the bottoms will wear down and fray quickly however.

I did see some people say that they shrink, my son is two and and two months old so I did order them in XS as he is a bit bigger for his age, I buy him 5T in shirts and 4t in pants so im fine if they shrink up, I bought these for the deal so whatever happens to them isn’t a big deal to me, at the time of buying they were $8.96 for a 5 pack, that’s a fair deal to me I wish they offered black as well, or other colors. They are cotton so they’re more on the rough, but not scratchy side, I’m only giving a 4 star rating because of my preference on the collar being so big, and also these are nice and lightweight for summer, these would make great PJ shirts, Play shirts, nice day to day shirts with a white tank top underneath, like I said very nice for the price."

His private parts were almost outlined for all to see. he wore them that day because we had no choice. that was miserable and he had a bad stomach ache at the end of the day.

I needed the flex waist because it has an adjustable waist built in so you can make it smaller if you need. My son is very tall and skinny so he needs to have the adjustable waist!!!
815,Amazon Customer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 16, 2022",Not black,"Very close to black, so much so that we didn't notice until he wore them with his black blazer.  They're very dark navy."

They fit much longer than normal and we had to hem them about 4 inches.  It doesn’t look great for returning to school for the first time in over a year.  The black pair is fine so far, but the khaki pair already has a rip on the lower leg, as of the 2nd week .  For the reputation of durability, the length of time in business, and the pricing I’m disappointed.  We chose this brand for the book and eye closure, which is easier for our son than messing with a button closure."

He was afraid if he sat down it might pop the seams. He has never had to wear huskies before and is average size, so they should have fit him. The color was a little off too. I'm definitely sending them back. They do seem to be well made as far as quality. It's hard to find pants without the double knees. I've been looking for good khakis for him a long time and thought I'd found the right ones, but I guess I'll have to keep looking!"

My kid is on the skinnier side, but these were big--I had to take in the waist as far as it would go. They also have a 30"" inseam, which in on the longer side.They feel polyester and not great. I wouldn't wear them.Honestly, if I had had time to order something else, I probably would have. But I didn't. And I couldn't find anything locally.The price is good and they would probably last a long time. My son needed them for a school performance and graduation, and he'll probably never wear them again, so I didn't want to spend a lot. From that standpoint they were good."

My son is 9 (turning 10 in a couple months, most clothes he owns are 10s/L and for perfectly) just under the 90th percentile in height and about the 50th percentile for weight. They were about 4 inches too long and the waist might have been saved that issue, but too much rolling bulky rolling of the pant leg to make it look nice for the occasion."
831,Carrie,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 19, 2022",Not bad but not what I expected,The pants weren’t bad. It’s just that I didn’t realize they were so big as in baggy. My son is trim and he was swimming in them. We made do but it wasn’t without some complaining.

841,Annie,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 28, 2022",Does the job,"These pants fit well but not as tailored at the ankles and through the legs as I’d prefer. They flare out a bit at the bottom (boot cut style). I wish they were fitted a little better for a sharp look but we made it work. Seemed to be a good value as they are nearly impossible to find in-store, as well as overly priced in-store. We purchased a size 18H originally which was too large then settled for 16H because anything smaller would be too small and a size up would be too big. Still fit good at the waist but too large through the legs and too wide (for my taste) at the ankles."

I've even bought packs of patches and placed them on the inside of the knees, but they wouldn't stay and fell out and then the knees wore out even faster it seemed. They are however, probably the cheapest jeans I can find, but for a reason. Because if that, they're normally the ones I buy first, when the first cold day shows up, especially because they come in so quickly as well.

Do not recommend if durability is of importance to you. I use Tide Free and Bounty Dryer sheets, wash our clothes together, wear socks in the house too, but none of my socks seem to have this issue. He said they fit well and were comfy until they all started getting holes. All the holes are in the exact same spots where the stitching meets up on the soles.

First, there’s an embroidered letter “L” right in the center of the heel with a big wad of material inside so it always feels like you have something in your shoe.

My son is in a size 10 shoe. These socks are INSANELY bigger than a size 10 boys shoe. Luckily I've seen all the reviews about the socks shrinking so I MIGHT keep them? Just because maybe they will fit him once they are washed.Also. Even though I ordered 4-10. The package I got is a size Large and is size 3-9. So the sizing on this listing does not match up to the packaging. I looked at the size chart to see if I messed up somewhere, and for some reason a 9-2.5 is a medium? But a 6-10.5 is a small???? But Large is a 3-9???Then lets just ignore that only two of those are sizes you can even order. There is no size 3-9 on this listing anywhere.

They were for my 6 yr old and at first glance they looked way too big for him. So my husband tried them on and he wears a 13 in men’s shoes. They fit him, only they were cutting his circulation off around his calf lol In summary.. they fit a 6 yr old who wears a size 13 in children’s and a grown man who wears a size 13 in men’s. They didn’t look too stretched on my husbands nor did they look loose on our sons. It’s weird. These would be 5 stars if the fit was fixed. They are very soft and thick in the right places."

The paint job of the biggest doll has several flaws, the cat is already scratched after only lightly playing with for tops 5 minutes and the babies legs pop right off.The dolls have a very slight baby powder smell if you really stick your nose up on them but they mostly just smell like plastic, no strawberry scent as advertised at all.My kids have a lot of dolls and these are by far the worst quality I’ve gotten. Do not recommend."
1010,Anna Stechyshyn,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 4, 2022",Complexion Misleading,"I am sure my kid will like the doll regardless however very dissatisfied with MarshaMellow not being the tan Olive color complexion that was shown in Amazon pictures like being held by a blonde girl, even in the videos, and on the box itself. I feel duped. The doll came out looking extremely dark and not at all like the picture. I also looked at other reviews and seems there is severe inconsistencies in complexion with this specific doll. Again not the end of the world but highly annoying. I would have picked a doll that looked more like my child if I had known."
1011,Sarah,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 4, 2022",Disappointed,We don't have this available in Canada so I had to order it from the US. The box was really damaged... It also looked really old? I couldn't gift it.🤦🏻‍♀️
1012,Amazon Customer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 25, 2021","From Defected, Damaged Batch?","This seems as if it’s from a batch of defected products and is being sold as new/perfect condition.My 3 year old loved the set, but that does not negate how shocked I was to see scuff marks all over the dolls. Additionally, pieces of hair were stuck in the eye socket (pictured in second photo) neck, and other various crevices of the baby doll.For paying $45 for a product, it is a reasonable expectation that the toy will arrive in brand new condition. That clearly did not happen."
1013,Amazon Customer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 20, 2022",Damaged Box,"Went all the way to NY from Trinidad for work and decided to ship this to the hotel for me to collect so I can bring home as a gift, only to receive the top of the box ripped. Such a shame as I cannot gift this item now. I am so disappointed"
1014,Kennedy,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 10, 2020",Poor design and not compatible with the Kindi Kids shopping cart,I purchased 2 of these dolls for my almost 3 yr old twins. I purchased Jessicake and Pepper-Mint along with the shopping cart. For some reason the Jessicake doll isn’t able to stand on the shopping cart without falling off. No matter how hard or how gentle I press her thumbs into the hole on the shopping cart she immediately falls off. Also I can’t get her to stand on the floor regardless of how I position her feet/legs. I believe I received a defective doll. Now the Pepper-Mint doll can stand on the floor without any problem. She can stand on the cart for a few moments before she fall off. I think the way the dolls were designed to stand on the carts is a poor design. And the they should come with more food items. Overall I’m not satisfied with the purchase of Kindi Kids brand and I probably will not purchase any more of this brand.
1015,Nana  Pam,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 11, 2021",Wonder if the image is meant to mislead?,"Very misleading photo on Amazon!!! I thought I was getting a “peaches & cream” complexion on the doll I ordered but as you can see that is not what I got. She seems to be a beautiful doll, just not what I thought I was ordering for my granddaughter!"
1016,pashopper,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 24, 2021",Disappointing,"Doll is cute, but that’s it. Hard, head heavy and not really great. Gave it to granddaughter. It came out of the box and after 5 min hasn’t ever been touched again.  Sorry I didn’t send it back."
1017,NoneofOne,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 13, 2020",Why so sad?,"Shes a cute doll but compared to the other dolls in this collection her expression seems less happy and frankly a little drab, as far as to say on the sad side.  If she was smiling as the other dolls in this collection she would have been perfect. I Debated on giving this as a gift for this reason."
1018,Anna Applegate ,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 9, 2021",I got sent a return with missing items,"My package was clearly already opened and just sealed up again. She was missing shoes, the smoothie, and the cupcake. I’m really upset by this."

1021,TINZ.FAM,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 4, 2021",Little dissapointed,Purchased this Kindi Kids set for my daughter's 5th birthday present. Not only was this NOT sent in the original box but the box was extremely damaged and taped (I do not mean the brown cardboard Amazon box it came it but the supposedly manufacturer box). Also none of the pieces were scented. So why call them scented sisters?  They are very adorable like all Kindi Kids are but im not sure if this was a resell item that was returned by a previous customer or if it is just a knock off. So beware of this before purchasing .
1022,marcy,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 23, 2021",Package is not what was showen,"I have alot of the kindi doll collection,  the box that these come In are a blue enclosed box you can not view the dolls unless taken out of the blue kindi box, not a open view like the photo showen. I would have not bought had I knowen this.  As a collector and as all kindi dolls I've bought or seen are in a box with thick plastic on the box and able to view as the photo showen in description is not accurate."
1023,Ethereal Vessel,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 28, 2021",Quality as to be expected......,"The doll seems fine upon first glance (other than the fact the doll was packaged entirely upside-down???) but when you inspect it a bit further you can see that one eye (the right one, from viewer's perspective) is malshapen. It almost seems as if someone heated the doll's face and pulled purposefully down on its eyelid to deform it slightly. The tulle the dress is made of has difficulty laying flat, as it was packaged with it scrunched up. And, I'm unsure if it's bun was meant to be a kempt circular shape... but it was not. However, I'm not too bothered about that as I am the malformed eye socket."
1024,Cindi Hostetler,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 4, 2021",She looked much less freaky in the photo!,"So... I looked through the dolls online and thought she was cute. A present for my three year old niece.  When she opened the box, the doll didn’t look like the pictures, a little too much creepy clown vibe instead of sweet baby doll.My niece didn’t want to play with her much, and my sister say they keep it locked in the closet at bedtime! Hahahahaha!"
1025,Jonathon Schmidt,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 14, 2021",Comes in a plain box,The contents of the package were correct but it didn't come in a cute box that you can see through. It came in a blue box that says kindi kids and you can not see the products inside. Kind if disappointed because its a Christmas present but its still cute.
1026,Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 4, 2021",Packaging is not good,I am also disappointed in the plain blue box packaging. How underwhelming for my daughter. The listing should say basic packaging instead of traditional cute packaging like the kids see in the toy stores.

1036,Megan,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 14, 2021",Not quite the condition I was expecting...,I paid for the cheaper version where it was mentioned the outer box was damaged - I didn't mind that so I went for it. The inside cardboard was also damaged (I expected some of that) but the doll's hair was fully out of its original style and tangled. There was also a small weird green spot on her eye I wasn't fully able to scratch off. Her bowl and spoon were in great condition. The toy itself is good. Just be aware that the doll may have some flaws if you buy the damaged box version.

I had no clue what she was talking about until I saw her watching it on youtube then I started to see this doll all over the tv in commercials. So i told her is she be good, help around the house, and make sure she does all her homework on time I will give her a surprise. Make a long story short, I hate shopping in stores so to be able to get online and Amazon to have the Kindi Kids doll for me to purchase was an amazing thing. The doll is cute and so far no manufacture issues with the doll itself.  Thanks for my kid loves it!!!!"

May not be a big deal for some but it is for my son. The material seems very stiff and rigid. That may change after being washed. Ordered slim fit and the waist was still much bigger that other brands slim fit. Luckily they have the adjustable waist band inside. They are a good length and the color (black) wasn’t faded looking.

1069,nadia,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 28, 2022",Husky sizing & problem with adjustable waistband,"My son needed a pair of charcoal pants for a wedding. I picked these over the skinny cut because of the adjustable waistband. The length is consistent with the size chart but the waist is ~28"", which is bigger than husky for size 10. Making matters worse, there is a manufacturing defect impairing the adjustable waistband -- the first belt loop is sewn through the elastic (!) pinning it to the full waistband size.I would have returned them but I cut the tags after checking that the length was correct. I did read a review mentioning a problem with the adjustable waistband but I didn't understand the problem until I was trying to use it. I was able to ""fix"" the problem by sticking a pair of scissors into the hole for the elastic and snipping the top part of the elastic where it was stitched. Unfortunately, the elastic band is now weaker just where we would be buttoning it.Between the manufacturing problem and the waist being many inches larger than expected I would not buy these again."

1081,Panda,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 14, 2019",Nice pants for a slim boy fit perfect and then we washed them.....,"Received these yesterday. My son is very slim and the pants fit great including the length and he is on the taller side so that was great. They have the adjustable waist and that helped out too as we needed to take in the waist just a bit.  However, I washed them in cold and then air dried them. They shrank about a half an inch to a full inch. That was really disappointing.  They are still long enough to wear but the length is not optimal.  A boys/men's pant is supposed to ""break"" near the ankle at the front of the pant  and still reach to 1/2 inch to 1 inch above the heal at the back of the shoe, and now the pant doesn't sit right near the shoe, just a bit too short.  I still will buy 2 more as this is as close to a good fit as I could find for this price-point. Quality of the material seems good. Let's see after a few washes."

I needed them for a funeral and since they didn't fit, I did return them. However, when I do need a nice pair of pants for my son in the future I will definitely purchase them from here. I just don't want to do that right now because he is at that age where he grows like a weed."

He is slim and average height, the XXL 14-16 (which is his usual size) fit him really well,  with just a little room in the legs to grow.  The quality of the pants is good, the fabric is soft and good quality.  The reason I  only gave 2 stars is because the pants came with stains on them, right out of the plastic.  There is a green stain a few inches long near the waistband of the pants, almost looks like a grass stain.  On the back of the leg there is also a black line about 6"" long, looks like a pen mark.  I decided to keep the pants because neither of the stains would be visable on stage and I didn't want to deal with an exchange.  Even though the pants will work for intended use I am pretty disappointed that I received a product with multipe stains fresh out of the package."
1112,bndonaldson,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 1, 2021",Shrinks in a cold water wash.,These pants would have worked for our Halloween costume but after one cold wash they shrank about an 1 1/2-2inchs and faded horribly. I purchased the same size in light blue the year before and they are still the same size have a year of wear.
1113,The book mama,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 5, 2021",Pilly!!,These pants were purchased for Halloween costume - thank goodness! Because they can't be worn for anything else after a couple of washes! They've poked up so much that they look gray and disgusting!

Baker,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 12, 2019",Fell apart before my kids even tried them on,"Before my kids even wore these pants, one of the waistband seams came apart during the initial washing/drying. My washer and dryer are so gentle that they’re barely effective at cleaning little boy clothes, so I don’t have much confidence in the quality of these sweatpants. The stitching is reinforced, so the waistband isn’t detaching yet. With that in mind, and given that this is my first issue with Amazon Basics clothing, I gave them one more star that I feel that they warrant. They’re not worth the hassle of returning though, so I recommend passing..."
1116,Elizabeth R.,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 7, 2021",Bleh - pretty bad,"These pants faded after just one wash. The draw string isn't adjustable. It's an odd fit (wide and big but shorter legs), but may suit other kids better. Not planning to buy another Amazon piece of clothing after this!"

1122,Kelli Besselman,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 17, 2022","Great pants, annoyed at price","These pants are great, good length/fit, and soft material.  However, they were a prime deal for the Amazon early prime days and were $2 more expensive than after the sale ended.  Hate when stores raise prices to have a sale.  Now that they're cheaper, they're definitely worth the money, just annoying 🙄"

The white goes with almost all his shirts and it’s hard to find white.  So he had an XL and then I ordered an XXL which said it was a size up but they both ended up saying 10-12 so that was a bummer. He won’t be able to fit them as long but I can’t find anymore white ones so these will have to do.
1133,GypsyMama,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 10, 2021",Cute and comfy!,"I don't know why it is so hard to find pants that both look nice and are comfortable for kids- especially as they transition from one set of sizes to another (in this case, from toddler sizes to little boy sizes). My kiddos is short, but these weren't so long that they were a problem. They were slightly big when they arrived, but he grew into them very quickly and it was more because he was in between sizes than the garment itself. He loves how comfortable they are. I love the fashionable cut and the shark pattern that made them cuter than all of the athletic pants that you find places for them to play in. As it cools down, he is going to get even more wear out of these. Thanks, Amazon! With changing rooms closed at a lot of stores, I especially appreciate the free returns on items when we aren't sure what size the kids actually are wearing!"

I bought these for my 6 year old son who has skin sensitive issues. Finding clothing that isn't ""itchy"" as he describes it can be frustrating at times for us. That being said these sweat pants fit true to size, are well made, are typical sweat pant thickness, are nice and soft and have no stitching on them that rubs against the skin. He's worn them a few times now and they have not shrunk while washing and drying. They are also fairly priced! I bought 3 additional pairs in different colors after we tested this pair and the quality has been consistent across every pair. I definitely recommend them."

Being durable, comfortable and able to hold up to multiple kids is my standard on if a clothing item passes the test.  I have found so many Amazon essential clothing items that are my preferred brand over name brand, or department store brand, etc.  These joggers are made of a thick, but not heavy material with a bit of stretch that's perfect for an active kid.  They are easy to go up and down and actually stay around their waist which is a big problem with my kids who are twigs.  I need these in every color now!"

1216,Mwoodruff,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 13, 2020",Wouldn’t Recommend,These stretched out really bad when my son was wearing them. The color also looks better online. I don’t think they’re as cute in person. Also $28 after tax for two pairs of toddler jeans are really expensive. I buy the toddler target jeans on sale for around $7-$8 each. They don’t stretch and they’re cuter. Returning these.

Luckily I had already purchased from somewhere else. This on is a spring jacket I guess because winter it is not. I would suggest to go a size larger & wear layers underneath if you think it will be used during winter.

Just to check I held it against the XL and sure enough they were exactly the same. I double checked the tags and they are marked differently. I’m keeping one for my 9 year old who is big for his age - he’s 4’7” ish and 85lbs. You can order either XL  or XXL for those dimensions. I do like that it’s light because even in New England you don’t need a heavy puffer most days. I bought this mostly for when we have cold rain.

However, the zipper is a little trickier for my four year old than most zippers. Also, and this may seem insignificant, but there is no loop on the inside to hang it up, not a big deal but when he goes to school his jackets fit best in his cubby if they can be hung by a little loop rather than the hood. My daughter has a similar one from primary and even though it’s more money I wish I bought him a primary one too since the quality is so much better, but obviously it was more money so you get what you pay for."

It fits him well and still has some growing room. This has the water resistant material but it is very thin and light weight so if the temp is colder outside you may want to layer clothing.
1278,Colbert Fan,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 30, 2020",Nice but order up in size,"Jacket is very soft, lightweight, my son likes it. Good for 'coldish' on its own and think with layering you could stay warm in lower 30's (just a guess right now.) Haven't tested water resistance but material is type to do pretty well with light precipitation & dry pretty fast. Have washed & dried & seemed to do well. Inner pockets. Puffer style but not overpuffed and much more flexible than some of those styles so that he feels like he can really move. Size up unless your child is short/thin. Kept the xxl & by charts the l or xl should have fit... And the XL probably would have fit exactly, but without any room for layering and no room for growth. It will get tested a lot this next week as we are having some of our coldest stretch of weather so far this year but we are in the south so it's not like winter in the north with snow and much lower temps."

1280,S. West,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 9, 2019",Great for the price!,"I bought this purely as a warmish layer to take day hiking and for emergencies. It will live in my son's backpack which stays in the car so I intentionally bought it overly large. For reference, he's 9 1/2 years old, 56"" tall and 59lbs (SUPER skinny). I got an XXL which is clearly 1 size too big. He would normally wear a XL in this jacket for sure. Out in the real world, he wears a 10/12. If this were down-filled it would be perfect but I had no desire to pay down prices and got tired of trying to find one used. My only real gripe is that that it just barely fits in the pouch. I'm guessing they provide the same pouch for all sizes and this one shouldn't go beyond an XL. Stuffing it in I felt like the seams would rip at any moment and sitting here looking at it it looks like they might spontaneously rupture at any moment. Might have to find something a little bigger to keep it in. Overall very happy."

They also hit at a weird point on the ankle, so very ""showy"" & look kind of stupid for ankle socks.

I get it and it’s very small and would probably fit a child and 5 to 8.5 T, as it says on pack but that’s ordering for a 3-4T In my opinion. So I exchange for the size small and this one is huge! It’s like there was no in between, it looks like I ordered a medium but I did not know the sizing is completely messed up. I wish there would be a sizing chart when you scroll through the product pictures Amazon really needs to fix this!

They did so I washed these in a delicates bag to keep them from getting lost with the rest of the load. Even in a bag the rest of the clothes in that load were covered in black fuzz. They shed like crazy. For this reason I didn’t put them in the dryer—super inconvenient to rack dry kids socks. When my son tried them again they didn’t fit even though I washed in cold water and didn’t put them in the dryer. I threw out packaging but luckily customer service issues a refund.

This made sense to me since our 4-5T Old Navy socks were just starting to get a bit snug. Well, I set them side by side and they were exactly the same size as our smaller pairs. I figured they at least seemed more stretchy and my kid didn't complain about putting them on so I let him wear them to school. After washing, they shrunk to be VERY noticeably smaller than his old socks. I'm not even sure if they'll accept a return/exchange to medium now that it's only a partial package of new ones..."

I literally used to have to run to the store to buy new socks like every other week if I wanted matching pairs. But not anymore! The sock itself is good quality, thick but not too thick. Comfortable. I bought the size the company recommended for my son and they fit great. Ive had them for probably 4 months so far? Maybe 5 and they are still great.

They wash up well, keep their shape, are a bit thicker, and soft/comfortable. Also, they are actually over 70% cotton, which is almost impossible to find anymore, at least without paying an exorbitant price. These are great for kids who tend to have sweaty/hot feet because they have such a small amount of polyester and high cotton content (much more breathable)."

It took me hours of sifting and picking undies and settled on these because of the character on the little booty. These are not very soft, they are not uniform in size, they have some wonky seams. Giving a 2 star review simply because they are undies and they will do the job. However, this false advertising needs to be corrected. I would have chosen to spend my money elsewhere had I known the actual print of the undies. This will not let me attach pictures with my review. I have pictures of what I received vs pictures of what was advertised/orderedEdit:Updated to 1 star because undies are now being advertised at $2 USD less.

1402,K. Chan,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 14, 2022","Fits True to Size, Warm and Comfortable","The Under Armour Boys' Armourfleece Big Logo Hoodie is a soft and comfortable hoodie that will keep your kid warm in cool spring or autumn weather.  The hoodie fits true to size, is soft and fuzzy on the inside, and doesn't have a tag on the back of the neck (but it does have tags on the lower left side that document how to wash the material.  The outside of the hoodie is slightly shiny and the logo has a slightly grippy feel to it and is just slightly raised off the hoodie material.  There are no strings on the hoodie, so you can't tighten the top around your face, but it's still a good size that will cover your kid's ears and head from the breeze.  The son noted that the sweatshirt was definitely warm enough for our cool California Autumns, but it probably won't be warm enough for really cold winters - this is subjective of course, given that anything under 50 degrees qualifies as a state of emergency for Californians.  Overall, this is a nice comfortable sweatshirt that the son loves and is worth considering if your kid insists on wearing logoed Under Armour clothing."

Here’s my son, 8, in the size M. He’s 85% for height and 20% for weight, but he likes his hoodies to fit loosely and more comfortably. He says this is extremely soft, and he’s been wearing it to the bus stop on chillier late summer mornings. Great UA quality that we’ve come to know and love. You can’t go wrong with this basic."

I bought this specifically for a Halloween costume for my 10 year old son (he wanted to be Blippi - if you don't know who that is, be grateful haha).  The size large was a PERFECT fit and it was everything we hoped it would be!  Now that Halloween is over we will definitely still use it for dressy occasions like church or weddings.  If you're worried that this shirt is too good to be true for $8, don't let that deter you!  It's a really high quality shirt and you won't regret it!I sincerely hope this review has been helpful to someone else!  And yes, I paid full price.  Feel free to ask any questions!"

First they don't stay up. He will pull them up and after taking 2 steps they have fallen down. Then the toes on them are shaped weird and he can't quite get the seam on his toes comfortably.

The price was perfect for the amount of socks being sold.But after one wash on delicate, with non fragrance detergent, and let air dry(I was afraid they would shrink) they have peeled and linted horribly! They are to the point that he can't wear them! I thought I was saving money but in the end I in fact have wasted money, because I have to go out and buy more socks!"

They typically lasted ages- as you'd expect, if a boy's hand-me-downs did for his mama for a few years. This lot, however, are VERY thin, not particularly cushion, and a bit rough on my skin. I'm disappointed, as Hanes has been my go-to for sport socks for decades. They shrink a bit in the washing, as expected, but not enough to positively impact their texture."

These after one wear and wash seem like they will never hold up as long as the first ones we bought. We have 4 boys and so far have used only this brand and loved them until this particular batch we got. They are a lot softer and pill immediately. Anytime a kid walks barefoot on any crumbs, sand, wood shavings from pellets or the never ending construction in our house, it sticks to them like a magnet even through the wash like they are too soft. I am not sure how else to describe it, the other ones we had we're more of a cottony feel and never pulled, these are like a cheap fleece microfiber material I was pretty disappointed in this order and hope it was just one bad batch from the manufacturer. I will be buying more in store next time."

These on the other hand... are terrible! They’re almost completely polyester and they were covered in little black sock pills after the very first wash. They’re all rough too. They definitely don’t seem comfy at all! They’re worse than dollar store socks! I honestly had higher expectations of Hanes as a brand. Why are they doing this to little kids who already get really sweaty feet? Plastic socks... come on! Yuck.

I ordered 2 pks in a size large for my 8 year old. They fit perfectly. The only thing I wish was for them to be a little thicker. Seems like with much rubbing/sliding they will thin out even more and end up with holes in them. This is what happened to the last ones. Not sure if the ones before were the same company/brand because their dad bought those for them. However I need too add that I constantly have to tell them to stop walking around the wood floors without their house shoes on. But do they listen? Sometimes. Does it drive me crazy? Yes. But like my mom always says, you can never have enough socks and underwear. Besides the fact that they are thin, they are perfect to keep their feet and bottom portion legs warm in the winter months coming. I will definitely by more when I need to."

After only 2-3 times in the laundry, the hem at the top of the socks began to unravel and unfold. This happened to multiple socks, not just one. Additionally, they began to pill and have little rough balls of cotton all over.The fit is right and they haven't worn through in the toes or heels, but they are coming apart at the tops and look terrible so I don't like for my son to wear them to school or other places.

I thought this was odd, so I compared the first pair to the other 11 pairs in the pack and found it to be the same, really thin and not really thick at allIt's what I should have expected, I bought a previous set before and they were nice, soft, and warm when worn but these... The previous pairs of Hanes I got were thicker, but broke away quite easily and didn't last long at all. Given that these socks are more meant for children and their feet grow out of them, it's expected as much.As unfortunate as I am to have tiny tiny feet, I buy them anyways, but I am now giving up on Hanes because it feels like they've cheapened their brand."

They fit beautifully and are very soft. Not too thick, not too thin. The boys love these socks, especially because you can slide in them! Lol. I, however, do not love how these socks have held up. Yes, they are worn by two active boys, and occasionally get worn outside with no shoes. But after the first wash, they came out covered with fuzz balls. Then the elastic started to pull, and lastly, many of them now have holes.  All this happened in less than 3 months of wear. So, I would give them one or two stars, but I gave them 3 b/c my kiddos like them so much. I wouldn’t recommend unless you want to replace them in a few months. Nor will I buy them again.

From the drop menu I ordered what said 5-6.5.  I ended up getting size small which fit my 3 year old. I was upset that I didn't get the right size, but I then came back to see what went wrong. So after some research I realized that 5-6.5 corresponded to size small or shoe size 4.5-8.5. The 7-8.5 corresponded to size medium shoe size 9-2.5. And 9-11 corresponded to size large or shoe size 3-9. The quality of the sock is good. So that is why I gave it 3 stars. Would have been five had Amazon been clearer about sizing. Also rated fit as expected because it mainly was an error in ordering the wrong size and the size small does fit a kid with a shoe size of 4.5-8.5."

1580,Geekymomreviews,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 30, 2021",Life is too short to be wasted in finding another pair.,"Using them for over a year and in total zen!So, as bland a white and grey socks sounds for a toddler, one of the best advice I got from an experienced mother was always get all socks of same color. Of course I didn't followed it during infant and early toddler hood. Enough was enough searching for a matching sock in dryer, in shoe rack and sometimes plain lost. Got these and my life has changed like those tv commercials lol.  But in all seriousness,  You as a mom know there are other and better things you have to or would like to spent time on than finding a lost sock while the kid is doing tantrum to either go out and you have million other things to take for the trip.So, the socks are holding good after months and months of abuse by a very active and outdoorsy toddler. I ordered crew socks and I fold it in a neat double fold when I want them to be shorter. Looks pretty cool and serves me for every weather. Also, washes great and the white remains white after just one wash. Size is true.Hope this has helped you in making a decision"

1583,NowthenGoers,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 31, 2021",Great socks that aren't tight on the calves,"I only give these 4 stars due to poor sizing chart. Many said they were for toddlers vs kids, so I ordered the small as my son is a size 8 shoe and the sock is for up to 8.5.  They are a little big but good enough to wear and he'll grow into them.  They seem soft and comfortable for my 2 year old and the best part is that they don't leave marks in his legs from the tops being too tight.  I've been struggling finding socks for him that don't have this issue, and so far these are the only ones.  Will definitely buy more as he grows and needs a bigger size."
1584,Jasmine,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 6, 2021",Good if you don't mind replacing them two or three times a year,"These are good socks.  My sensitive boy finds them comfortable. The large size fits his size two feet.  I would give them five stars if they lasted longer (toe holes) and stayed soft after multiple washings.  They get a little ""crunchy"" after a couple months.  I'll continue purchase these unless I find softer, more durable socks in the future, because they are a great price, my child likes them, they don't stretch out of shape, and the shape of the sock is spot on."

He wears mainly boots and they fit really good, are stretchy and don’t mash his toes together like some socks I’ve gotten. Plus you don’t have to play mix and match with them.

I ended up having my son wear a t-shirt under the shirt. The pants, as many complained, have a very bad elastic and slide down the body. My son is on a small side, at 2y4m he mostly wears 18m. these pants which I got 2T just fit his butt. If he still wore a diaper I'm not sure they'd fit at all. I expected better from Carters..."

Honestly, a perfect matchup of his interests all around. However, I was unexpectedly delighted to find that the dragon pj shirt is sewn! With solid pieces rather than printed on. How great is that!!! As a thrifting mom, I've found that those kinds of designs are the ones that last forever and continue to look great wash after wash. They are also a lot more fun to touch and my son will give me one of his printed cookies to eat every once in a while. Also beautiful that the knight isn't slaying the dragon but taking it with cookies instead. I'm a big fan! The other jammies are still really great as well, just not sewn on so the quality isn't as good but the graphic is still really well done. The gorilla design does puff and scrunch out a bit after washing, but still cute."

I see the description ""Actual colors may vary"", however this is ridiculous when i've clearly chosen one advertised pack over another.

My kiddo isn't into sports so he is not going to be as excited to wear these.

But seeing as I needed to know if they fit anyhow, I decided to open them anyways, rather than go through the process and unpleasant hassle of trying to obtain a replacement and being short on underwear.My waist is 28"", approx., so I ordered these in Large, and I have to say: these fit like a glove. There's just enough expandability that everything is snug, yet comfortable, and there's no slack around the wasteband, despite them having a similar listed size range to a small in Men's.I absolutely find these comfortable!

My son had to read it, so I had to buy it. I read it and was sickened that my son is given such crap to read.  I don't feel it is necessary to expose children to such horrific times in history.  There is enough violence on the news, in video games, movies, etc.  We don't need it in all our K-12 school books, too.Isn't there anything positive and uplifting that humans can read? This is not non-fiction, so these are not facts they are learning.As far as the actual storytelling and writing, I found many flaws and things that did not make any sense to me. The writer wants the reader to believe, with everything else that is going on at the time, that the little boy could leave his house everyday at the same time, be gone for hours, and have no one notice. Even though the mother was preoccupied, there were housekeepers and many others around to notice.  And no one noticed?I as a reader was not convinced as to how that would be possible.I feel the reader also missed out on the opportunity to point out other possible scenarios as to why the father did what he did. Did he have a choice?  Perhaps he was trying to protect his family? Had he declined his promotion, or not taken part, it would not have been just his life, but also the lives of his family that would have been taken. The father was presented in one light, and one light only.  He could have become a much more complex character.  The son was also made out to be worse than naive, he was portrayed as just plain stupid at times. Children are not that stupid.Beware of the positive reviews written by professional reviewers as well as the unverified purchasers."

He regularly and openly visits his new Jewish friend through the barbed wire (as if the guards would have allowed that), and at one point puzzles over his friend's thinness, yet never figures out that dreadful things are happening.  The Jewish boy says nothing to correct his friend's dim-wittedness, but instead makes vague comments about his dire situation.  Eventually the dimwitted lad works his way into the camp because he's jealous that his Jewish friend has more people to play with.  He dons someone's ""striped pajamas"" to fit in, and blithely slips into a line for the gas chamber.

It could have been set anywhere. The boy in the striped pajamas was hardly a character at all, his role was ridiculously small given the books title. Between the repetitiveness, unnecessary side stories and details it seems like a story a child would write in English class.

For one thing, a child of 9 or 10, would rarely be seen leaning up a fence - where the boys have their first encounter. Kids 14 nd under, unless there were extenuating circumstances ( tall and older looking, twins), we murdered along with the old, the handicapped, and others who were just randomly chosen to die.Secondly, anyone leaning against any camp fence would have been killed by a massive jolt of electricity.There are many other little details but as long as the teacher's guide provides the correct history, and the teacher educates the students correctly on the historiography ( simplified for younger students) then by all means use the book as an allegory, but nothing more.Finally, in ending, the conclusion of the story is so egregiously far fetched as to be laughable and this is the part of the book that saddens me the most.

But two things prevented me from enjoying it.One: No intelligent 9-year-old in Berlin in the 1940s could possibly not have known who the Fuhrer was or how to pronounce his title. So, Bruno, the protagonist would have to be severely emotionally or mentally disabled - his thoughts are those of a five-year-old. Does the author know any children? This kid is a complete idiot. The child doesn't know his nation is AT WAR? Please.Bruno's inability to observe the suffering of hundreds of people living next door to a camp is impossible to believe. He can't see how miserable these people are? They're all wearing the same clothing and that doesn't make him think prison? Where has he been living, under a rock? He's been to school, he's had friends, he's never heard of prison uniforms? It's absurd - no trees, no grass, little huts, no nothing and he thinks these people are living there voluntarily? I mean, really.And he's never heard anyone called a Jew before? Even if that were true, why doesn't his older sister illuminate him? Or his father? Certainly,  the Germans weren't embarrassed about what they were doing at the camps. And in Berlin, children were encouraged - expected to join various Hitler youth organizations. His father would have explained it all to him. Hating Jews wasn't considered a secret in this society, and the head of a forced labor/extermination camp would have been fine with it. Or he wouldn't have brought his children to live there, now would he?SECOND - Schmuel has all that empty space in which to wander on his own? Nonsense....even literary license doesn't make this believable. No one was permitted near the camps, and the space wasn't endless and empty. Day after day, this little Jewish boy is allowed to wander off by himself? I don't think so. The camps were well guarded with sadistic and vicious troops. And I'm already giving the author literary license in that a nine-year-old child would have survived that long in a camp without serving some role - most of the stories I've read or heard indicate that those who survived had a skill that the Nazis made use of. Or served other purposes."
1708,reader78,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 17, 2013",Simply Awful,"I'm giving this book two generous stars because it does address the topic of the Holocaust.  It is important to remember even unpleasant parts of out past, lest we repeat them.  Another reason I grudgingly gave it a two is because it does warn the reader that it is a 'fable'.  Other than that, there isn't much redeeming value to this story.  I would not recommend it to others.  This pacing of this book is too slow at times.  The story itself leaves one with a bad feeling.  The ending is simply for shock value and adds very little to the story line.In the beginning of this book the main character, Bruno, is a selfish, spoiled, oblivious little boy.  At the end of this book he is still a selfish, spoiled, oblivious little boy.  There is basically no character development.  Even after everything the character witnesses, he has absolutely no idea (or refuses to acknowledge) what is going on right outside his window and to his friend. As we progress through the story, there are several aspects that are absolutely unbelievable.  I am willing to suspend a little of my belief because it is listed as a 'fable'.  For example, the one place that the two boys happen to meet is the only place in the fence where it is not properly attached, or the fact that they boys have the same birthday. However, I am not willing to change the facts of the past.  The author simply cannot expect us to believe that the nine year old son of a high ranking German official has never been in the Hitler Youth, which begins at age six.  The author cannot expect us to believe that Bruno's school would not have taught him about the concept of the 'fatherland'.  Schools and lessons were filled with propaganda at this time.  And I certainly cannot believe that Bruno does not know what it means to be a Jew or that he has never even heard of the word Jew.  Additionally, the Jewish friend in the story sits along the fence for long periods of time with no one noticing.  This is inconsistent with life in concentration camps.  I feel these inaccuracies take much away from what could have been a very interesting story.On a side note, I listened to an interview with the author about this book.  The interviewer asked about some of the improbable things in this story.  He addressed only the fence and the birthdays.  I would guess he had no explanation for the other items either.In short, don't bother reading this book.  There are far better stories about the Holocaust."
1709,Kristyna,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 11, 2018","Language inaccuracies and Poor Character Development, Not the Best in Historical Fiction","I was excited to read this book because I enjoy historical fiction and books from this time period. I think one of my biggest pet peeves with this book that brought into question its credibility is the many American/English sayings that don’t make sense when you consider the characters are meant to be speaking in German. In one specific example, the older sister often questions the way Bruno pronounced Out With and the book notes that Bruno didn’t understand the name and asks “out with what” which is an American saying and wouldn’t be translated the same, mean the same thing or sound that way in German. It makes sense in an American context that Auschwitz would be pronounced Out With but it wouldn’t literally mean “out with” in German as it does in English. I understand this book may be meant for younger audiences in the way it’s written and that those readers may not question these things, but for me it really caused conflict with the book and the author. It seems like a silly thing to overlook.Another thing that bothered me was that Bruno so easily forgot the names of his friends, even if it was to show passage of time and his bond with Shmuel. As someone that has moved at even a younger age than Bruno, you don’t forget people’s names so easily and quickly and especially when he remembered the names of his sister’s friends until the end of the book. I remember friends from early childhood, it’s odd he would forget their names within a year regardless of how close he grew with Shmuel.I’m also not sure that the ages of the kids are represented correctly with the way they act and speak. They seem to be younger than they are based on their personalities, but I suppose that could difference in times."
1710,Peggy Weatherington,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 16, 2021",Not my favorite WWII story,While I realize this was written for a young reader the writing seems very simplistic. Both of the children seem too naive and immature for their ages. Bruno is nine years old and even after a year of living right next to the concentration camp and talking with Jewish imprisoned boy most days he still does not grasp the gravity of the camp and neither does his 12-year-old sister. I love WWII historical fiction but this was definitely not a favorite for me.

This was my all time favorite movie which set high expectations on the book.  I felt it was poorly written and felt very conjested.  I also did'nt like how the author expressed character expression by saying ""he opened his mouth in the shape of an O"" that just annoyed me.  He also repeated himself a lot in the beggining he must have talked about the maid Maria finding things he hid in the back of his closet 10 times.  What could a 9 year old boy possibly be hideing?  I also found i really did'nt like or care for Bruno in this book he was a naive, pouting, spoiled brat in no way like the movie in which he seemed innocent and kind hearted.  Another thing that annoyed me was i don't think the author was very clear and i can't believe i'm saying this but he was'nt nearly descriptive enough.  I hate books that are to wordy and move to slowly but this was just the opposite i found myself saying wait what about that.  I was very disappointed.

1712,Gargamel,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 13, 2008",Pretty lame story,"A sappy story that tries to denounce the absurdity of the Holocaust by looking at it through the eyes of two children that, despite being as involved as children could be, cannot even begin to comprehend the situation. This book is really quite lame for adult reading;  it never made me care enough about any of the characters.  I think the right audience is probably kids in their early teens. Problem is, kids in their early teens probably don't know much about the Holocaust, so a portrayal from a child's view that can't even say Führer or Auschwitz properly is surely not going to help them understand. (The use of words by Bruno like ""Fury"" or ""Out-With"" to refer to those also didn't make a lot of sense to me, particularly because Bruno speaks German, not English.)

I read it along with him and was interested to see how the subject of the Holocaust was going to be covered for a young adult audience.  I was disappointed.  If you didn't already know about the Holocaust, then you would be completely lost reading this book.  Only with prior knowledge would you know that ""Out-with"" is Auschwitz or that ""The Fury"" was really Adolf Hitler, The Furor. I know this was supposed to be from the perspective of a 9 year old (Bruno) but I wish the author would have done more to explain the connections through other characters.  There are parts of the book where Bruno's sister tries to correct him, but the book never explicitly says what the correct terminology is!  I had to explain this all to my son as he was reading and trying to understand.  So I recommend that you follow along with any child reading this and help them with the actual historical context to supplement the ideas in this book.I feel like if this book wasn't about a sensitive topic, no one would recommend it as a good book.  I hope someone else takes on this subject in the future and writes a better book than this one."
1718,Jane C.,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 22, 2019",Huh,"I had heard of this book, but only read it because I recently finished Ladder to the Sky, which was terrific. This book was not. I gave it three stars because it was so harrowing, and the fear and dread it conveyed are an accomplishment. But it wasn't that well written, and some of the details were distracting. How could a nine-year old boy from a wealthy Berlin family have never heard of Poland? Or heard the word Jew? Bruno's obliviousness towards the camp and what was happening was mostly believable. But a nine year old is aware of different countries and religions. Even more unbelievable was 12 year-old Gretl's pronouncement that the mysterious place they have been brought to was the ""countryside,"" like it was a semi mythical place she had only heard rumors of. Bruno's lack of basic knowledge is in contrast to his relatively sophisticated ability to read people, and even gaslight his sister. And the cutesy garbage with the Fury and Out-With was just stupid.The use of English idioms was also annoying. Overall, great idea, sloppy execution. I'm not saying terrible execution, because it was horrifying. But so amateurish. It's like the author of this book is the opposite of his fictional creation in Ladder to the Sky. Great at thinking up a story, but can't write. I realize this is children's fiction, but that almost makes it worse. Maybe the author was pandering to his young audience by trying to make them feel smart compared to Bruno and his sister? Very disappointed."

But I kept thinking... I only have a few pages left, and this is it?  I guessed the ending, but was still very emotional about it.  This was my 2nd book since reading 50 shades - so perhaps I was jaded by all the redundancy in that book, that I was angry every time I read ""hopeless case,"" the description of his house in Berlin, or any other number of repetitive text.  It was like I would find myself skimming over words while rolling my eyes because I knew exactly the phrase he was writing. I watched the movie the very next day (thank you Netflix) and it was great.  Very close in detail to book. The book was short so not much they had to leave out. I didn't look before I bought but I'm wondering if this is written for middle school aged children.  I'm in my 30s and actually like YA books, but this one just seemed a little too simple.

Maybe because this story is told from an oblivious nine-years old boy. In terms of sympathies, abhorrence, and overall disturbing history of WWII, the author actually got the atmosphere down pat.For the most part, Bruno's voice didn't quite match his age. I have a nephew the same age: trust me, he is inquisitive. No matter the time, and how well parents shelter kids from the storm, they still know what's going on. Shmuel and Bruno being on opposite sides of the fence shouldn't have made Bruno unawares.Still, I always find some silver lining in reading historical fiction, and The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is not a book that I regret reading.

It is written in the style of a children's book, but I can't think of any child I would want to read it. It also seems strange to write a story like this seemingly intended to teach a young reader something about history and what people are capable of when the main character in the book, 9 year-old Bruno is so clueless that he is not aware that there is a war going on or that his own father is the head of Auschwitz concentration camp. How are young readers supposed to understand this if the main character, who is supposed to be living it doesn't understand? Also the writer tries to be cute or clever with words when Bruno thinks throughout the book that the name of the camp is Out-with which in German and polish languages does not rhyme with or sound anything like Auschwitz. I guess this was done because it was written for an English speaking audience, but it is cheesy and is done more than once."

1726,D. Pangal,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 5, 2014",Sad and not credible,"This was a heartbreaking story told from a child's point of view in Nazi Germany. I feel as other's who have reviewed this book that the boy Bruno is too naive to be believed. I understand he is only 9 years old but at that age you certainly would be able to figure out a thing or two. The friend Shmuel he meets across the barbed wire fence is also 9 years old and his naivety is even worse. He is in a concentration camp and seems to be able to stroll around at will. He has no idea that it is a bad place? Parts of this story were very well told but unlike the movie ""Life is beautiful"" where the little boy was 5, these boys are 9. There is a big difference in those ages as well as the childlike innocence. Any book concerning the Holocaust is horrifying but this ending is especially so."
1727,Audrey,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 19, 2022",3.75 (rounded up to 4),"Given how much WWII fiction I read, I'm surprised how long I procrastinated this one. Until joining a buddy read, I wasn't aware of the more problematic themes, so I went into this with some skepticism.There are definitely major issues with the book, most of them surrounding Bruno's obliviousness and lack of empathy. What was more infuriating was the lack of correction from his family and even Schmuel. The son of a Nazi Commandant would not be in the dark about his father's role in the Holocaust — at the minimum, the Nazis' war against Jewish people — especially living next door to Auschwitz. The Nazi mentality started young. Hitler formed Hitler's youth for a terrible reason. The fact Hilter himself shows up in the story says how involved Bruno's father was. There is no way he would be so naive at the age of nine about what was happening. Not in this setting.What was more annoying how Bruno's refusal to accept what little correction he did receive. I'm not fluent in German, but 'Out-With' translated to German would be something along the lines of 'Aus-Mit'. 'Fury' would be 'Zorn'. They aren't fitting with the language that the characters would be speaking. It was errors like this I found distracting and frustrating.The point of view in which the book is told is where my stars come from. Though Bruno would have realistically known more, I believe he might have had questions about the way the Jewish people were being treated. This would have made a much more powerful story. That's not to say there was no impact with the friendship Bruno and Schmuel do share. At its core, it's a story about two lonely young kids finding an unlikely best friend. There is a level of innocence here that can't be denied.Another praise is the writing. It flowed fantastically. It's just too bad that it wasn't a little bit longer and more in-depth. There was a lot of potential for more even if it is geared toward a younger audience. I see why it's received so much praise since its publication, but it is good to keep some of the issues in mind when reading. This is not an accurate portrayal of the cruelties the Nazis were capable of despite the ultimate sadness of the book. Without previous knowledge of this time, it could leave an uninformed impression, particularly on younger readers.**EDIT: The more I've sat with this book, the more I realize I remember more of the inaccuracies than what I did like. I'm dropping the rating a tiny bit from 4 to 3.75."
1728,Learn’d Astronomer,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 13, 2022",This left me speechless.,"Like with all of John Boyne’s books, I found myself needing some time to digest what I just read once finished. It’s as if each of his books deserves a moment of silence.Written from the perspective of a child who clearly doesn’t understand the depravity surrounding him and the utter devastation of spirit he’s living next door to, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas offers a touching view of the innocence among children when they haven’t yet been taught how to hate. It’s this innocence of spirit which ultimately leads to a compounding of tragedies and brings the horror of the Holocaust home - literally - to an unsuspecting Nazi Commandant."
1729,Randolph Todd Redmon,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 21, 2014",and I think this is a good book. The author is John Boyne,"Have you ever read a book called The Boy in the Stripped Pajamas? I have, and I think this is a good book. The author is John Boyne. He was born in Ireland in 1972 and he currently lives in Dublin (teenreads.com).This book is about a 9 year old boy named Bruno living in Berlin. One day Bruno comes home and finds his servant, Maria, packing his clothes and other belongings. Bruno asked her why she is packing his things and his mom, who is standing behind him, tells him that his family is moving to a place people call “out-with.” When Bruno and his family arrive at “out-with,” Bruno was not happy at first but after staying there a while he started to like it. One day Bruno looked out his window and saw a camp so he went over and investigated. There were a lot of people in the camp and a tall fence around it. While on the outside of the fence, he met a boy named Shmuel. After a year they became friends. Shmuel told Bruno that his father was missing and Bruno offered to help find him.  Shmuel gave Bruno some striped pajamas and together they went to search for him. While looking for Shmuel’s father, they got lost in a crowd that led them to a dark room and after that day Bruno’s family never saw him again.The main characters of this book are Bruno, Shmuel, and Bruno’s father. The book started in 1942 during World War II. The story began in Berlin and moved to “out-with,” which is how Bruno pronounced Auschwitz. The author wrote this book to inform people about what it was like in Germany back in World War II era. He also wanted the reader to learn how the Nazis treated the Jewish people from the point of view of a young German boy.I found this book interesting because it showed some historical German events; however, I thought I would learn more about why the Germans were treating the Jewish people like this. I think a history teacher and a student wanting to learn about history would be interested in this book.I think the author was biased because he mostly talked about what Bruno was going through. I also think the major characters were biased because at first, Bruno only talked about how he hated his new house. He focused more on himself and did not come to the aid of anyone who needed his help. Later on he focused on being friends with Shmuel. He became sympathetic towards Shmuel and risked his life to help him find his father. Bruno’s dad was biased because all he wanted to do was keep the concentration camp a secret from his kids.  He was a commandant in the German army and was only focused on his work and dedication to Hitler.People who read this book are going to gain a better understanding of how the Jewish people were treated through the eyes of a young German boy. We can use this book for knowledge later in life when we teach kids about what happened in World War II. This book is about having friends who are different from you.I would have to ask the author some questions about the characters and events. There are some loose ends in this book. At the end of the story Bruno was helping Shmuel find his father but they get lost in a crowd that leads them into a dark room and that is where the book ends. I wanted to know for sure if Bruno and Shmuel died. I also wanted to know what happened to Bruno’s family and his servant, Maria.I think people should read this book because it gives them a better understanding of the way Jews were treated. The book is also about friendship and how two boys would risk anything to help each other. I recommend this book because it shows how to make friends with people who believe in different things, have different cultures, and like different things."
1730,robin friedman,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 28, 2006",Striped Pajamas,"John Boyne is the author of the historical novels, ""Crippen"" which deals with a notorious London murder, and ""The Congress of Rough Riders"" which is about Buffalo Bill.  His short novel, ""The Boy in Striped Pajamas"" is a historical novel about yet a third time and place. It is a story of the Holocaust.  It is a good short read -- I read the book through in a sitting and during my reading was absorbed -- but less than compelling.The book is largely written eliptically and with understatement.  The author wants the enormity of the Holocaust to dawn upon the reader through indirection. The chapters flow together well and the writing, while mannered and repetitive in places, is good on the whole.  Something of the Holocaust and its terror come through in the book even though the story line is predictable and banal. (I was reminded of Hannah Arendt's phrase ""the banality of evil"" in reading this book.)The chief character of the book is Bruno, a nine-year old German boy whose father is a high-ranking Nazi and on good terms with Hitler (called ""the Fury"" in the book.) When he becomes Commandant at Auschwitz (again, referred to as ""Out-With""), the family must leave their large home in Berlin.  Bruno is bored with life at Auschwitz and misses his three former ""best friends for life"" in Berlin.  He harasses his twelve year old sister, Gretel, (the ""hopeless case"") until, wandering around on his own he comes across the boundary of the camp and meets a Jewish inmate on the other side of the fence wire.  The inmate is a boy of Bruno's own age from Krakow named Shmuel.  Shmuel is dressed in the striped pajamas of Auschwitz prisoners, although Bruno does not understand the significance of the pajamas or of Shmuel's life in the camp.  The two boys become friends.The brutality of the Holocaust comes through in the seemingly ordinary home life of the Commandant and his family, the naievity of the children, especially Bruno, and in the Commandant's military assistants, especially a young soldier named Lieutenant Kotler.  I was moved by the story, and by Bruno's fate, on an individual level.  But I found I didn't learn anything new about the Holocaust, and the book didn't get me to think about the Holocaust in a different, revealing way.There is some question about the intended audience for this book.  I read it for an adult book group, and there wasn't quite enough in the book to make it rewarding for that use.  The book appears to be written for adolescent readers as an introduction to the Holocaust and its causes.  The book is readable and the story line is good.  The book may indeed encourage some young readers to think about the Holocaust. But even for young readers, I am afraid this will not be an especially memorable book.  It is strained, and I can't escape the feeling of triteness.Robin Friedman"

1733,Cindy Eiden,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 19, 2010",An Amazing Read!,"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas was an amazing read for me.  It was a fairly quick read.  I think I finished it in two sittings but had to go back and reread the ending just for that final emotional punch.Although the Holocaust is an extremely serious topic, John Boyne has chosen to write an allegorical fable and I think this was an interesting and creative way to go, but the reader must be able to suspend his/her disbelief.  Not a little, all of it.  I think it is important for readers to know and understand the book is a fable and is written as such.  The book is told from the point of view of 9 year old Bruno who is incredibly naïve and therefore does not understand his fathers position or the true purpose of ""Out-With"" (his name for Auschwitz.)  I could spend hours pointing out historical inaccuracies or situations that are just plain impossible but again, this is a fable and historical accuracies are not the point of the book.  The fable that makes this book serves a few purposes in my opinion.I liked the exaggerated naïveté of Bruno.  It serves the purpose of implicitly letting us know the horrors that are occurring ""off-page.""  This is nearly as terrorizing as actually reading about the atrocities because you KNOW exactly what is happening but it's not actually stated.  Left to the imagination, these atrocities can be just as appalling or worse because no one is telling you what to see or feel.  I felt this was a great psychological tool Boyne utilized throughout the book.Secondly, this fable serves to remind us that we will never, ever know what it is like to be that boy in the striped pajamas.  Putting such a serious topic into such a naïve representation reminds me that I am naïve.  I am like Bruno.  I will never be able to completely or truly understand what went on for those in the striped pajamas.  I like having this humbling reminder.  I think this is the main point of the book.  Only the victims and survivors truly know.  I see this book as a tribute and a lesson.Another aspect of the book that I felt was a mind game was the actual the turning of the pages.  I know this sounds funny.  I'm not spoiling anything by saying that the story is about a German boy who befriends a Jewish boy (who is in ""striped pajamas"") during the holocaust at Auschwitz.  I KNEW from the start of the book it wasn't going to end well.  I knew with each turn of the page that I was getting closer to a most-likely devastating ending, yet I had to keep reading.This book definitely touched me.  Although told as a naïve fable to represent intense situations, I thought the book had lots of different layers to peel away.  I am glad to have read it and I have recommended it to others."
1734,beezee,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 23, 2020",A great book about a German Boy and his Jewish friend,"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a story that tells about the life of two boys during one of the most horrific events in history— the Holocaust. There is Bruno on one side of the fence:  the relatively happy German boy living in a large house, with plenty of food and a good life, completely oblivious to what was  happening on the other side. And this is where Shmuel lives: essentially caged away, starving, living in a filthy concentration camp; but being a little boy, he is unaware of the atrocities surrounding him. But despite the drastic differences of life, the two boys become friends. One of the many things in the story that made me sad was the complete unawareness Bruno had regarding the horror of Hitler’s regime, even though his father was the commandant who runs the entire concentration camp. He thinks “heil Hitler” is just another way to say hello. I would say that this book would be appropriate for children ten and up because younger children might not understand the story contextually, and because it is obviously a darker book. Kids ten and below might be too young to have these dark kind of things introduced to them, which is sad to think that Jewish children during the time actually lived in these conditions. Overall, it was a well-written,  excellent book."
1735,danny devito,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 10, 2021",Book is in good condition: horrible subject matter,"The book I ordered arrived on time, and was in good condition. I have no complaints about the objective book itself. As a literary text, it’s awful. The grammar and uses of imagery are plain and distasteful, and the main subject matter requires background information which was not given in the book in order to have a clear understanding of the text. As a book, it kinda sucks actually. It’s supposed to give a more human look into people who suffered the holocaust, instead it’s choppy and robotic. Not my favorite book by far"
1736,beep,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 15, 2016","I also thought how much the Jews were hated, by both children who had been taught to ...","I felt this book moved quickly and was a very compelling read.  I've read many books on the Holocaust and though difficult material, I believe it is important to remember this period in history so that it won't be repeated.  I think it was an interesting perspective told through the eyes of a young child who had been sheltered from much of the truth of the times.  The twist at the end left a raw, sick feeling inside me, which I believe was exactly how it should have ended.I did feel there were a few details that seemed unbelievable.  I wouldn't have thought that the Jewish boy would have been able to leave the camp to spend so much time with Bruno and this kept popping into the back of my mind as I read.  I think the parents would have noticed his long absences or one of the servants would have.  At times, I wondered at Bruno's naivety and wished his character could have grown in his sympathy and understanding of his friend a little more as the story progressed, although he did have some breakthroughs at times.  I also thought how much the Jews were hated, by both children who had been taught to hate them and adults, yet Bruno didn't seem to understand any of this.Overall, I did think this story was thought-provoking and worth the read.  It surely could lead to some worthwhile discussions with children about why it's so important not to try to silence those with different opinions and belief systems than our own.  This book is a good catalyst for this."

1738,David Seaman,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 27, 2012","to join ""Sophie's Choice,"" ""Night"", ""Anne Frank"" and show you your own voice.","It is quite possible that more has been written about The Holocaust than any other historical event in history. Not just in regard to hard research, but many of the world's finest novelists have fictionalized the story, film makers have touched upon the subject, playwrights, composers, painters and poets. If there has been a way to express the shock- and shock is an understatement in this case- it has been attempted. John Boyne, a gifted and now internationally known Irish author, wrote the book ""The Boy In The Stripped Pajamas"" in about two weeks time. As he said, in order to maintain ""the voice,"" once he began he was afraid to stop. The same is true when reading it- we are compelled to continue and it is evident from early in the book that Boyne has disguised the terminal words so that it can apply to any and all of the other holocausts' that occurred prior to and after this one. In fact, only once does Boyne choose to use a ""telling"" word; on page 54 one of the officers says, ""Heil Hitler"" but then we are told that the boy assumed that this was like saying, ""Well, goodbye for now and have a pleasant afternoon."" The boy, his name Bruno; his age nine, misunderstands the key words and Auschwitz is written as ""Out-With"" every single time. The negative pun- the only way I could describe this- suggests the old work rhythm, ""In with the good; out with the bad."" Then the boy mishears the Furher as The Fury"" and this negative pun needs no description at all. We have a moment when Bruno meets ""The Fury"" as well as ""her"" when they come for dinner and Bruno is appalled at how small The Fury is, but how kind the beautiful blonde woman with him is (her name is simply Eva). The innocence and ignorance of this young boy is as critical to the brilliance of this work as the story of the Titanic. (I speak not just of Cameron's film, but Maury Yeston's musical, ""a Night to Remember"" and the three other films made between 1938 and 1984) Boyne uses the literary tool that his audience not only knows so much more than Bruno, but that we are anticipating the sadness that ends the novel. So we are prepared to cry but when the end does come, Boyne shocks us in such a way that instead of tears, our mouths are opened in the O shape that he uses to describe several characters through the book. This book is by no means a ""Sophie's Choice"" though the horror is just as shocking, but few writers in history have been able to achieve what William Styron did. Still Styron's novel and Boyne's novel use a similar foundation but their books are about very different things. Where the ending is horrifyingly shocking and, like Styron's ""Sophie's Choice,"" completely unexpected (who in fact could have imagined an ending such as this one) the poignancy of ""The Boy In Striped Pajamas"" makes it impossible for this book- and the fame it will bring Mr. Boyne, you heard it here first- to become satirized in any way. Because the innocence and ignorance, as a result of the way his parents have shielded Bruno, is a metaphor for the way in which the population who was aware of the death camps were inactive; complacent and how the same continues to occur day after day from the beginning of recorded time to the continued genocide in Darfur- the world's largest death camp- to which the UN has placed sanctions against while The full force of the American military tore apart Iraq in search of Weapons of Mass Destruction. The current political winds in the United States suggest that Gay Americans and Female Americans are just as vulnerable. All of these circumstances suggest that you could very well be next. John Boyne manages to suggest all of this is his two hundred page fable using a modicum of brilliantly chosen words. John Boyle has sub-titled his book, A Fable"" and it is. His final words are like a double edged sword: ""And that's the end of the story of Bruno and his family. Of course all of this happened a long time ago and nothing like that could ever happen again.  Not in this day and age.""The irony of this ending reminds us that this is a fable, but more so, it makes us stop and think of the responsibility that we all owe to anyone who has been maltreated, either in the form of Bruno, Anne Frank, Sophie Zawotoski or Carol Stewart, Amy Fitzpatrick, Dave Pelzer and the millions of others. This novel is worthy of a prize. It's not a children's book, though my children should read it. It's not an adult book, but all adults should read it. This would rule out the Newbury or Caldecott. In regard to its literary merit, the American version needs some editorial work (only once did the editors miss a pajamas and leave pyjamas) but the writing is pristine and brilliant and worthy of The Pulitzer. As far as The Nobel Prize for Literature, it is worthy there too. But mostly it's is worthy of you. And, like ""Sophie's Choice"" I am told that a motion picture is in the making. Depending on whose hands it falls into this could be a miracle. The innocent eyes through which Bruno's story unfolds are critical and these innocent eyes are just as important as Sophie's guilty and lying soul. If Benton could do it, perhaps ""The Boy In The Stripped Pajamas"" will as well. But there are a lot of ""Maybes"" involved with the hopes of John Boyne, this critic and every other artist who has attempted to move us. As far as I can see, Boyne has done his part. This book, like Elie Weisel's ""Night"" needs to be published in as many languages as possible and marketed toward as many customers as possible. No one should keep this book from the hands of a nine year old nor should anyone consider it a book too young for adults. In short, this is a remarkable book in every way and perhaps, after more times has passed for thinking and another read through or so, l may well see that there is no other possible way for this story to have ended. Not in this day and age."

1742,Jason Bond,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 27, 2019",The Tale of 2 Innocent Boys...,"The story about the son of a Nazi commandant and an innocent Jewish boy is absolutely amazing and filled with tragedy that may cause some to tear up. It talks about both perspectives from the Nazi's and the Jews in which give us a variety of ways we can view what the book is based off of: the holocaust. The book is absolutely gut wrenching, both filled with the emotional history and the bond between the two boys.The book was published on January 5, 2006 by John Boyne and is under the historical fiction genre. Bruno, the son of the Nazi commandant and his family, moves from Berlin to a residence near a concentration camp. Bruno was sad and lonely due to his lack of friends and walked behind his house where he saw a boy on the other side of a barbed wire fence. Both confused and unaware of their situation, their unlikely bond grew strong.Bruno and Shmuel (the Jewish boy) are just as confused as any kid would be. Bruno doesn't know why the fence is there or what it symbolizes and nor does Shmuel. They are completely unaware of their surroundings which prevents one thing from getting in their way: fear. Fear causes worry, distraction, emotional pain; things those innocent Jewish prisoners had to go through in the cruel concentration camps. Because there is confusion amongst the boys, it allows the author to explain his message in simple terms so that the readers can fully understand what he's trying to say.Boyne has a rather-- interesting style of writing. His writing is very simple and easy to understand, however, he includes secret messages and hints that are hidden behind his simplified terms in which makes it very unique. His tone is very subtle yet can be an emotional explosion and because he mastered the use of how he expresses himself, he uses this to his advantage which makes his writing very captivating.Other authors who write historical fiction books, for example Markus Zusak and The Book Thief are different from Boyne’s style. Other’s consist of different perspective on narration or a frequent use of explaining things in the context of the text in which Boyne clearly points out for the readers to identify.One thing that the audience should be aware of is how much he emphasises on discrimination. No one should be ashamed of being who they are because of things like the religion they believe in or what color their skin color is. Shmuel along with the rest of the Jews were thrown into concentration camps and shamed on for being Jewish which in no way is a reason to be discriminated for. Discrimination is still a big part of society to this day and sometimes, we might not even notice that it’s happening.From reading this book, the message seems to be clear. Everyone should be treated the same, no matter how you look or what you believe in. We should be caring for each other and accepting the faiths and opinions that people follow and are a part of. It allows for more diversity amongst society and makes our everyday lives a little bit more interesting.Because Boyne is good at making things simple to understand, I think I would recommend this book to middle school kids. I feel as if at that point, they’ve reached a point of maturity and that they should be aware of the history that happened before them and the things that are still happening in the world. Parents might want to say that it is “inappropriate” for kids at that age but I feel as if discrimination is a worldwide conflict and that informing kids at a young age will better prepare them for the future.Will humans completely comprehend the danger and effect discrimination has on people?Probably not, but by reading this book, it can give you a clear understanding on why it happens and the things it’s capable of."

I thought these socks would be pretty large on him, but they are not at all.  In fact, they appear to fit very well.  The package does not have a fabric breakdown listed, but it does not feel like 100% polyester; it feels like a cotton/poly blend with a touch of spandex.  I like that there is a slight cushion on the footbed.  Shrinkage after washing (low heat in dryer) was minimal, if any.  Initially, the only feature of which my son was not a fan is the supportive rib-band in the arch area (I think it just felt strange for him).  Nevertheless, he seems to have gotten over it and now happily wears these socks daily.  I cannot tell if these socks run small because they seem to have some stretch to them.

I knew that I was getting a low grade pair of jeans for $10 but 6 weeks with very selective use.... aka in the house only and to special occasions.Moral of the story if you need lasting jeans for the fall or winter, buy a better brand with better quality.It's mid April for me right now with probably 1 month left till shorts weather... so I'll probably buy one more pair to get buy as my son won't need jeans here by the end of May."

However, the were very long to the point he was able to pull them up past his belly button and still walk on them. The fit around the thighs and butt were more like fitted or skinny jeans.

He is average height but slim in bone and waist- which turns out to be a common problem when I chat with other moms. These jeans from Children’s Place in “slim” are a great solution. Their regulars don’t work and I can’t find slim in their physical stores. There is that button and elastic waist adjuster in these, but I only have a few holes in to adjust on the slims. On regulars- you adjust and it never fits right- they either are too tight or fall down. I’m impressed and the price was reasonable.

1817,Kindle Customer,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 13, 2022",Great option for the price.,"We homeschool our boys so they are out with their dad and I all the time. We have horses, dogs, poultry, cattle and farm ground so the chores are never ending. Our kids work right along with us so jeans are an absolute necessity. My middle son just turned 9 in Sept. He is tall and stout, already wearing a size 16 husky and is still growing like crazy. I've replaced his jeans every couple of months for the last year now. I had always bought Wranglers but those start at about $30 a pair depending on which style your buying. Needless to say, that gets expensive when he's outgrown them in 2 months. I ran across these jeans and I was pretty skeptical due to the price. I originally ordered 1 pair to see how well he liked them. The material is definitely thinner than Wranglers and i know they wont wear as long but i know he will outgrow them before they wear out. Over all, they are great for the price and he says they are comfortable. I ordered 2 more pairs. This way I can get by with just a couple pairs of Wranglers for him to wear when we go somewhere and these while he works and plays. I will say thatthe thinner material is great for the summer but will be cold in the winter. He has insulated underwear and coveralls so it will not be an issue for us."

These pants are small in the butt, the elastic in the waist is bunched up and still too large & of course with elastic there is no adjusting, the crotch is extremely long, mid-thigh; both pant legs are past his ankles with one leg 3 inches longer than the other. No pockets. I purchased these for him to wear around the house or to go outside and do a few quick chores. There is nothing I can do to make these fit!  This might be a fluke that I received but I was relying on the Hanes Brand Name so to even return these I will have to get transportation to/from a UPS store which would cost more than the pants. I personally do not recommend this substandard product or vendor."

Paid $7 for each and bought 6 pairs. They were so big when he tried them on last year; I thought since I paid such a cheap price, I would save them for when he grew into them. Fast forward to December/2020 and my son is 9 and 107 husky pounds during coronavirus. He has worn each pair twice and just sitting around during virtual school (not hard-core wear and tear). 4 of the 6 pairs that were bought in gray and black has come unsewn in the crotch through the washing machine!!! These pants not only are super-sized but are very poorly made!!! Do not recommend this product!!! I googled Under Armour pants for the best price!!! Highly recommend Under Armour!! My 107lb husky 9 year old wears a Youth Large in Under Armour. Under Armour does not fade and the product is top of the line!"
1849,Sara K.,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 18, 2022",shrank & seams split,"These immediately shrank despite being washed in cold and dried low, and then the seams unraveled starting in the crotch. Useless after one wear."
1850,kiwi fan,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 14, 2022",Terrible sizing,I bought a medium (10-12) at first. It was way too small. Ends of legs 3 inches above the ankles. Hip was very very tight. Then I bought a large (14-16) size. Way too big! With a 14 inch rise! See the pic. Can't believe Hanes doesn't have something in between these two options.
1851,Amazon Customer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 18, 2022",Sizing is way off!,"I ordered a Medium for my 8 year old and it was way too big - too long and the waist was so loose they wouldn’t stay on. Followed the size chart that says a medium is a (8-10), the tag actually says (10-12). Went and ordered a small and it is tiny on him! The length goes to his calves. I’m dumbfounded by the sizing."
1852,Louis,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2020",Don't know how long they'll last...,"Bought these for my six year old. Mostly for lounging around and obviously not going out so much these days. However, out of 4 pairs of these, two have already developed rips in the crotch seam (the first one was worn less than 24 hours). Granted a replacement was sent for that one, the second was out of return date barely, just a little over a month.While they're together; they're great loungers and it's easy enough to sew these up when this happens with some better quality stitching. However I don't feel we should have to, especially this early or with this light of use.Guess you get what you pay for, I just would expect it to last a little more than 5-10 days of actual use. Hopefully the others will last at least another month or two, otherwise will most likely be removing the last star."
1853,D. Miller,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 25, 2021","Not fleece, cheap sweatpants","Well, these are pants as advertised but they are not fleece and very poor quality.  These are regular old super-cheap sweat pants and they are overpriced here.  Seriously don’t buy them you will be hugely disappointed. Eco smart is marketing-speak for “all synthetic fabric” which doesn’t breathe well.  They run small and shrink after the first wash.  Because of reasons not important here, I did not end up returning them but wish that I had.  Huge waste of money. Do not buy these pants."
1854,GRMom,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 11, 2020","Too short, poor quality","I consulted the size chart and chose size small for my son, who is in between sizes 7 and 8 in pants right now. We always struggle with pants being much too wide around his waist, and the dimensions in the size chart suggested that size small would actually be a good fit for him. Well, these pants are about 2"" too short, although the waist does fit. I was going to return these, but my son said he didn't care and wanted to keep them. Today is the second time he has worn them, and there is already a hole in the crotch area. He thinks it's hilarious, but I am pretty disappointed."
1855,Kindle Customer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 19, 2022",Sizing is waaayyyy off,"Some reviews say these run big, but ours were way too small. My average build 6 year old couldn't even pull them on and went to the very slim built 5 year old. Since they only fit the 5 year old, they are too long!!"
1856,CMD,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 19, 2020",Sizing is wrong,"My son typically wears a 10-12, as he is 10 years old and 91lbs. According to the size chart provided, I ordered a medium. They are way, way too small on him. Too short by about 3 inches and too tight. I'd say this is more like a boys size 8-10 at best. I think an average 8 year old would fit the medium. He already took them out of packaging and wore them, so I assume I can't return them. It was for a clown costume he was putting together, so I'm not overly concerned about the sizing issue because he is supposed to look ridiculous, and he does in these small pants. Besides the fit, they are comfy sweatpants - nice material, good color."
1857,Amanda,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 9, 2022",Thin and stiff fabric,"I was searching for fleece pants when Amazon recommended these disappointing sweat pants.  The fabric is very thin and not very soft.  If I'd felt the fabric before buying, I wouldn't have purchased them."

Im 5'1 and 110lbs and it was so small and short on me it was like if you took a pair of black leggings and cut it at the knees
1859,Addicted2Amazon,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 25, 2016",(WAS) Fave out of 3 brands...,"I purchased 3 different brands. I was surprised that the cheapest brand, Hanes, has not pilled, is comfy abd looks great on my son. Will order more. The size 6-8 fits perfectly on my almost 7yo son who is small for his age. The size 6-8 seems more like just a size 6.UPDATE: After giving a 5-star rating, I purchased 4 more pairs in different colors. Although the elasticity in the very first pair was perfect...this second pair might as well be called open bottom/open leg because the there is no elasticity. The leg opening is 1.5-2 inches larger then the first pair of navy sweatpants I received. Back in the day the elastic piece could be shortened to adjust...not anymore...cheaper ways. If I wanted open legged sweatpants, I would have ordered them. Even the same colored pants aren't conformed. Maybe these are defective/rejects Hanes can't sell in-store?!? These sweatpants no longer fit a short kid...such a shame!"
1860,Smyers,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 9, 2020",Not worth it,"The quality is horrible.  I ordered a bunch (maybe 5) of these for my boys (ages 9, 10 &12) to wear bumming around the house or under snow pants out in the snow.  Two of them had the seams rip in the crouch within the first day of wearing with minimal activity.  They also arent very thick, the fleece seems to be very cheap and doesn’t feel like regular sweats.  The trend right now is a cuffed bottom and the boys like the elastic - these can be hard to find; so I ordered these rather than take my chances at the store. I hoped that these would last for a few seasons but these won’t even last the winter.  Really disappointed."
1861,Jessica,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 3, 2022",Size chart incorrect,The size chart lists L as 12-14 which is what I needed for my son and as you can see from the picture it’s actually 14-16 so now it’s too big. Hopefully it shrinks in the dryer.
1862,Sonya Lawrence,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 23, 2022",Sizing chart is wrong,The pants are fine themselves but the sizing chart says medium is 8-10. The tag in the pants says 10-12.

I bought these because I wanted something comfortable & warm to lounge around in without wondering how long it’d be before the knees started looking all stretched (because as we all know, it always eventually happens to tight pants).  Mission accomplished."

He is more tall and thin built so these fit a bit baggy in his waist but not that much. They aren't falling off or anything. The length is great. Really was the reason for purchasing these was to get long enough to go beyond his ankles and these do! I will get more now I know.

1883,Lilith,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 28, 2022",This is the comfiest sweater pants in kids sizes I've found,"I bought these because sometimes fall nights can get very chilly, even if the day time is very warm. These sweat pants are extremely comfortable. They have a lot of room on the inside, and the inside is incredibly soft. It's perfect to layer over other clothes, or to wear on its own. Using the washer won't take away from the soft feel of it, and if your kid has sensitive skin this shouldn't irritate it at all because it doesn't grip you in any sort of weird way.The black will fad just a tad after a month or so, but it still looks strong. What made me like it was how long I could keep it and still have her fit it. The ankles and the waste has a very elastic belt that keeps everything fitting in the right places. So if you buy large you know you'll be able to have it fit all year."

I got these because I thought it was a brand I trusted but this material is NOT soft enough to be used as underwear. Even after washing and using a softener. They're also small as others stated. My son is very slim and usually wears 3t but the 2t/3t size is much to tight on him. We'll save these to keep in the car or at Grandma's for emergencies or accidents but I've ordered something else for him that I hope with be properly soft as undergarments should be.

He loves his super hero briefs but they are tight and don’t slide up or down easily.  The size charts don’t have a single size that corresponds to his measurements, age, etc.  In my search for a better fit, I decided to try boy boxer briefs for a waist of 26  (boys medium) and ignored the height and weight size from similar boxer brief recommendations.  I wasn’t positive but it looked to me that these boxer briefs also looked to have more room for his large thighs.  I also anticipated push backs since they didn’t have his favorite super heroes on them so I bought me a pair in my size and turned it into a game.  They fit great and were so much more comfortable that they instantly became his preferred underpants.  Great price and wound up fitting great.  I took a chance and got lucky."

My kid is size 5 so they should have room, instead the foot part of the sock covers half his foot and the part that is supposed to be on his ankle/up his leg, is instead at his heel. Absolutely tiny, toddler size socks."

1960,Kimberlymv,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 27, 2020",Be advised the size chart is WRONG.,For some reason I didn’t read the reviews about sizing before purchasing. I bought a size small for my 5 yr old who wears a size 1 shoe. The “accessories” chart said a small was for ages 6-8. Yeaaaa NO. They fit my 3 year old. I agree with everyone else- they’re socks. Post the sizes for SOCKS! Of course I opened them before realizing how small they were :(

1963,deanna,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 22, 2021",pretty good if you can figure out your size,"These are of surprisingly good quality for house brand Am socks.  The retro look is cute.  Unfortunately, the sizing is way off and very confusing as it overlaps and has seemingly two different metrics (numbers and SML).  Size 4T-5T never fit a size 9 3yr old.  Heel was in the ribbed part of the sock - not comfortable or durable there besides looking terrible.  Went with the chart which says a size M for sizes 9-2.5 and even though I washed on highest heat and dry to try to shrink, they don't fit a size 10 foot at all.  And even if the foot part fit, the legs are so big, they are like slinkys bunched around the ankle.  Doesn't work.  The leg size would maybe work for a chubby middle schooler.  They might even fit me.  If you can figure out sizing or are up for ordering one set of each size, by all means.  Otherwise, luck to you as there's no human behind the AmMachine to actually put items through controls, adjust to feedback, etc.  Only cackling Gross-os who is too busy looking at his cowboyreflection."

1973,Don,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 26, 2022","Good, but I’d suggest one improvement","My son likes these socks pretty well. He says they’re soft and does like the stripes. His only complaint, and mine too, is that the toe seam needs to be moved back as it’s right on the top of his toes. Along with that, the grey part needs to be larger. The point of that is to not let staining show as much, but as it only covers the front tip of his toes it’s basically pointless. If Amazon fixed that these would b a much superior product.So in summary: soft, comfortable, look goodDownside: weird/bad toe feel and lack of gray color toe coverage."
1974,Meka ,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 20, 2022",To small,Love the socks but they were too small. Buy a big size. My baby is 4 and his 4t 5t socks was too small.

At the time he wore a size 2 shoe, so I ordered size large so he could grow into them. They fit perfectly when he grew to size 3 shoe. Son is regularly active and wore these socks almost every day spring, fall, and winter. Socks lasted about 9 months to 1 year before getting holes in the bottoms. Exactly 1 year after purchase I just threw the last pair away.They started out soft and after several washings turned a little more coarse fabric but still comfortable."

But these are really skinny fit. When I first opened these, I was shocked as how can a human being get in these, and I had gotten a bigger size. My son somehow managed to get in, so yes there's a bit of stretch in the material but it was extremely uncomfortable and tight fit. I can't imagine how much tighter these will get after a wash. Also the length is stupidly long, these reached till his knee. I don't know what the idea behind the fit of these is, but it's not as an undershirt."

They were tight but tolerable as an undershirt.After the wash. They were about 2 inches shorter and still too crunchy. He refused to even leave it on for me to take a photo.The material is not soft like an underwear should be. They're so thin you could rip em with your hands a la, the Hulk. They might be fun to shoot a hulk action scene with. But most likely will become dusting cloths.My kid is about 45 inches and 35lbs"
1999,Suzan zipp,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 14, 2022",So cheaply made,These are super scratchy. Not soft at all! There’s not even a hem on the bottom.  The bottom of the shirt has absolutely no stretch to it. The fabric is so rough.. Really disappointed. They actually irritated my skin
2000,Jessica F,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 14, 2022",Fell apart after one wash,I was super bummed that these tops didn’t hold up. Washed once and every single tank top came out with at least one hole. Very disappointed. Tried to leave a negative one star but that wasn’t an option.

I instantly saw it after i took it out of the washing machine and was too scared to put it in the dryer. I suppose it would’ve shrunk even more.

2016,Wendy,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 5, 2022",Very thin and horribly made,Please wash before your child wears it. I allowed my son to try it on and he had white fuzz all over himself. It was very cheaply made shrinks.

After you wash them, there is hella shrinkage. My daughter is in 18 months and can fit them once they are washed. I would def size up and wash them so they fit, unless you don’t mind your child looking like Pooh after you wash them."
2020,Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 20, 2022",Ok under shirts,"Ordered these tanks for my son who has sensory processing disorder.

When my son put one on before I washed it, it was down to his thighs, But AFTER Washing it, it was just enough to tuck in. Quality is good and for as many as you get the value is good."
2023,Fay W,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 25, 2022",Comfortable and stretch,This is a great undershirt as it is super comfortable and fits beautifully. The only downside is that it tore pretty quickly.

2026,Gin,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 5, 2022","Totally, for me, an UNDERshirt!","This is accurate to the description: an UNDERshirt. Because it is so thin/transparent, I like to wear it under a T-shirt when I'm in an a.c.(ed) room. It is tight putting on (3⭐️), but once on, it hugs the bod nicely (4⭐️).  The under-arms are pretty long, but after some dryer cycles it has shrunken a bit, so it's not so bad (-altho, I do prefer FOTL's  original pattern, myself!).  The shoulder stitching is a bit bulky-looking, but it is not an issue.  Last…  SO far, the length has shrunken fine; the lower back isn’t exposed when I sit.I have yet to see how these parts shrink, let's say, a year from now.  That's IT!"
2027,Sunny,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 24, 2022",Fits perfect,This fits very well for my son that's 8years old he is petite and slim. Not husky. At 1st I ordered the medium wayyyy too big..these fit perfect with room to grow and very soft & stretchable.
2028,Buttercup,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 23, 2022",Perfect for summer,These little tank tops are perfect for summer or letting the kids play in the creek or lake. Something to just throw on and go with a pair of shorts. They are soft and they have a good stretch to them also. They fit by five-year-old perfect. The only issue I have was shipping the poor bag was almost black and looked like it had been really roughed while in shipping. There was a little mark on one of the shirts from a hole in the bag but it should come out the wash hopefully other than that we love these
2029,Dee,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 31, 2022",Worth the money,I highly recommend these. Worth the money.
2030,Roxana,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 20, 2022",Great material,I bought these for my son he used 10/12 but I ordered 14/16 as 10/12 wasn’t an option and good thing I did because they RUN SMALL thankfully they have some stretch and will work.

2041,Liza,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022",Size up,"This pajama set is so cute! I’m glad that I sized up when I ordered, because they are definitely meant to be snug-fit. For reference, my baby is 29 lbs, comfortably wears 2T jeans and tees, and he wears 24mos. onesie shirts. I ordered a size up in these PJs, and they fit him snuggly, but not tight. The 3T allowed for a comfortable fit. Unfortunately, after the second wash, one of the seams tore—this is the only reason for my low rating."
2042,Melissa C.,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 16, 2019","Cute, but cheaply made","I ordered this for my child to wear for Christmas morning.  You know?  Cute pictures with your kids in matching festive pjs.  Unfortunately, the other set (which is far cuter than Santa on a motorcycle) was sold out in my son's size, so I ordered Santa on a motorcycle cause I thought at least the striped shirt was cute.  Well, I got these in and washed them so our elf on a shelf could surprise the kids with new Christmas pjs.  The top developed a hole in the sleeve after first wash/dry in our machines.  Our washer and dryer are less than a year old and I find that the washer is very gentle with our clothing (and with two kids we CONSTANTLY wash clothes).  I guess I'm stuck fixing this hole with old fashioned needle and thread."

I am disappointed in the quality.  Specifically, compared to pajamas from the Carter's line for Target (Just One You), these look cheap.  The Target line has an almost identical Santa set, but the picture is stitched, instead of this plastic decal.Especially at this price ($15.99, no sale), I will be returning these and purchasing a set of Carter's pajamas from Target or directly from Carter's.(I think my son would love this set, but I'm pretty sure the front image will crack soon.  I was hoping to have these last 2 Christmas seasons)"
2053,Kelsey Roberts,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 8, 2019",Not worth it,I was in love at first it was so cute and exactly how I thought it would look. I thought I got a great deal for this product and was very excited until I washed them. I followed the care instructions yet the red from the collar seemed to bleed into the rest of the shirt causing it to have pink spots. I'm extremely disappointed with how they turned out. I have never had that happen with any other carters products. If I could I would return them but since it was after tags were removed and it was washed I'm out of luck.
2054,Amazon Customer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 20, 2021",probably not the most durable,"After wearing them one time, there is already a small hole in the pants.  They are so cute so this is very dissapointing."

The inseam on the pants came undone and became chaps shortly after putting them on the first time.  If it wasn’t for them being Christmas pajamas I would have returned them. Looks like my daughter will be a cowgirl in her stripe chaps for Christmas Eve.

The glitter does not appear to be in the paint and is just on top of the design.  The fit is as expected, but I'm not interested in finding glitter all over my baby's crib and throughout my house.  Overall the quality of the pajamas (except for the glitter part) is on par with other Carter's pajamas I've gotten from Target and straight from the Carter's website."

They have several other sets of pajamas by Carter’s Simple Joy in the same sizes which I purchased this time and they fit wonderfully. I kept them as my girls can wear them in a few years but currently they are exceptionally long. I have a 32 inch inseam and often purchase longs when available in jeans and yoga pants and the size 8 was pretty close to being the right length for me. For reference, my 5 year old wears size 5 and 6 in Carters and Jumping Beans and my 6 year old wears 7 in Jumping Beans, Carter’s, 90 Degrees and an 8 in DKNY clothing."

I’m so tired of going to big-box stores and only finding fleece or polyester pajamas for kids. Those materials aren’t breathable or necessary to wear in good ol’ Florida.These pajamas are true to size, breathable, and are somehow stretchy enough to make it through two seasons. I prolong the life by washing on cold and popping in the dryer for a few minutes, then hanging to air dry. Cotton does shrink, but this way it minimizes the shrinkage.My only complaint (and the reason why I didnt rate these 5 stars) is that they come with 2 shirts and only one pair of pants. I was on the fence about this, but they were cute so I decided to purchase them anyway. For the price, they should definitely throw another set of bottoms in there. But alas, companies are always cutting corners, especially in this date and age."

They keep their shape and colors stay bright wash after wash. Burt’s Bees are stiff and their whites don’t stay bright. Carters and Target’s Carters brand are soft but don’t keep their shape and don’t last more than a season. Old Navy are also stiff and their colors fade quickly.

I make the children wear pajamas through the year even if they’re themed for Christmas. They grow too fast. So these were awesome for Christmas PJs last year and we’ve been wearing them since. The we’ve grown so the pants are now shorter but the tops can keep going without them. They’ve washed great over the year. No holes or signs of major wear in them.

2101,Natalia Vargas Toro,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 26, 2021",The material is not all fleece,Beware- top is cotton and bottoms are fleece. I needed all fleece and in the description did’t said that
2102,Sofía Rodríguez,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 10, 2022",No se ajusta a la descripción,"Solo el pantalón es polar. El buzo no! Ojo porque para invierno que los niños deben estar abrigados ya que se destapan, no sirve!"
2103,CA,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 29, 2022",Ugh...just don't,Tops are cute but the bottoms are weird shaped pants made out of some discount felt and are reminiscent of that time your 7th grade class had a sewing project where you made some pajama pants.
2104,Dom B,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 8, 2020",Top have pills/fuzzballs!,"The graphics are super cute; our toddler loved them. The bottoms are fleece and are nice. The key problem is after a few washes, the tops started pilling with fuzzballs and itching my son's skin, breaking out in rashes. I have tried to remove the pills with a fuzz remover, but they keep coming back even after a few hours of wear. We have stopped using the tops, and they are not within the return window anymore. So now only the bottoms are functional; however, since our toddler is interested in a set (will ask for the top and not wear just the bottom), the set has rendered useless. It feels like money down the drain after wearing a few times! I would not buy the set again."
2105,GurPreet,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 9, 2022",Size not approprite,Though i ordered 1 size more than my child’s size still it is not appropriate
2106,Amazon Customer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 11, 2020",They are fleece,"It didn't say anywhere that these pjs are fleece. I honestly wouldn't have bought them if I had known. When it said they were cotton, I thought these outfits were lighter so kids who sleep hot can still wear something cute for Christmas"

2110,Ira ,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 5, 2020",Strange size between pants and shirts,Shirts are big pants are short
2111,AH,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 19, 2022",Not Comfortable,The appliques on the shirts are so large that the entire inside of the shirt is scratchy backing for the design instead of soft fleece. It also makes the front side of the shirt rigid. Sending back and going to look for just a solid top.
2112,SuraRuchel,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 17, 2022",only pants are fleece,"heads up only the pants are fleece, the shirt is not"
2113,Grace Noel,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 2, 2022",Runs big,"My son wears a 2T and I didn’t want the snug fit because those are normally small, but these are SO big on him. They are more like 3T or bigger. They are really soft and nice I guess we will keep them and he can wear as he grows"
2114,Guillemin Thomas,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 17, 2022",Top and bottom has different material one some colors!,"Be careful while ordering since only dinazor and bear has both bottom and top one in fleece. We loved the bear one and decided to order one more set in different color, realizing that top is different material than bottom. We loved the bear one though, giving 3 starts since description is not clear and very confusing."
2115,Sarah,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 18, 2022",Big in the waist,"Cute pajamas. Fit well in the length, but the waist fits weird.  My 4 year olds keep falling off him; he does have a tiny waist, but this size I ordered normally fits him well."
2116,Dayana Abundis,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 20, 2022",The pants fit low and are too large,They are very soft and cozy but they are to big from the waist and keep falling down k can’t even food them because they are too low but they are very comfty and cute.
2117,Flashy,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 8, 2022",Not true Carter brand.,Fabric too thick. Not true to size. Not true Carter brand.
2118,Augusto,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 3, 2021",Extraña mezcla de telas,"Los pantalones son de un tipo de tela y las camisetas son de otro tipo de tela.Es decir los pantalones son ideales para invierno, porque la tela son tipo polar, pero las camisetas son de otra tela, ideal para verano.No entiendo por qué hicieron esa mezcla, es como si fueran conjuntos diferentes.Pero ambas telas son de calidad."
2119,Tara Bergfeld,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 3, 2022",Runs big,Cute and quality material but runs very big.
2120,B2388,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 2, 2021",Cute pjs,"These pj's are super cute. The only down fall is the shirt is a hair magnet. When washing and drying, any loose hair that made it into the wash will end up weaved into this shirt."
2121,Tania,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 2, 2020",Look inside of the top...,"I had one Carters set for girls (3T) but these are way to bigger than the one I have already. I like the design but for God’s sake WHY are you using this chemical nonsense from the inside of the set for sleeping?! It’s not even ok for casual clothing but sleeping?! Carters people, are you thinking about kids safe at least 10% of your project???"
2122,Ksellen,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 29, 2022",Comfy Jammies,The pants are a nice and soft fleece. The shirt is a little thin but over all happy with the purchase. My 3 year old loves the patterns.
2123,Kari,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 25, 2022",Runs big,Normally my son wears Carter's 2t but I'm not sure if it's because these are 'loose fit' or because it's fleece but these fit more like a 3t on him. I had to roll his sleeves and pant legs so he wouldn't trip. They are super soft and comfy tho so we will keep them. I'm sure he'll grow into them soon. My son is 30lb and 33 inches and fits in most 2t clothes. He's on the chunky side
2124,Thomas Beck,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 7, 2022",So soft!,The tops are so soft! My son loves it. Good value.
2125,Abrianna,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 19, 2022",Soft and comfy,These are the perfect jammies for a little one. My son gets super hot when he sleeps but these are so breathable it doesn’t bother him! Didn’t shrink after first or second wash.

2128,Lo Roehrig,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 24, 2021",Runs A Little Large,"The product is great! Just give your kid time to grow into it lol, I ordered a 4T for my son who can’t even fit into much 3T stuff at all anymore but pajamas especially. They ride too high so we have done 4T for about 6 months but these are way too big for him. He won’t be able to keep them up on his waist so now I have to wait. Just hope he fits them next year when it’s cool enough to wear these to bed again. He is currently 32 pounds and 3ft 2in tall so I’m assuming if he weighed a little more and was a bit taller they’d fit perfect!"
2129,Justin & Catherine,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 25, 2022",Size,"Order a larger size.  We ordered the size my son wears n everything else and these were snug on him, like really snug."
2130,Nora,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 24, 2022",My son loved it,It's super soft and I liked it. I have experience buying clothes online and luckly I always order two sizes bigger than it's supposed to be. My son is 3 yo and I ordered for 5 yo. It fits perfect.
2131,Brandy W,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 29, 2021",Great winter pjs,I bought the nearly awake and moose set for my 5 year old son. He doesn’t typically like to wear pjs but lives these. I think they are slightly thin fleece but apparently they keep him nice and warm. He says they are soft and comfy. He needs 5t more for height than size in the waist so they are a bit big but it gives him room to grow and they fit like most other 5t clothing. I absolutely recommend these!
2132,Matthew P.,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",My son loves them!,"My 4 soon to be 5 year old loves them, they run slightly large or my son could possibly be a little smaller, but that’s okay they are jams so they are comfy and cozy! Very soft and he loves the different themes. I love these kind of pajamas way more then other kinds. They are actually soft and not that itchy material that’s super small and clingy, and shrinks when washed. These are great and seem to be pretty good quality as well. Perfect for the fall and winter Thank you"
2133,Oceanwavesrainydays,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 15, 2022",Love it,"These are adorable.  I got them for my daughter even though I found it under boys! She loves them, super soft and well made! I got 5T for her even though she's a 4T hoping she could grow into it. She's 3'2"" and 43 lbs and they are long on her and a bit big all around so order the size they're in now because it's a bit big!"
2134,Kory Tisor,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",A little big for the size ordered,These are very nice and soft! Very thick and well made. Just a little big. Would have ordered a size smaller
