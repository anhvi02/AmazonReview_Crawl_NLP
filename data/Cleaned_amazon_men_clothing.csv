Damien Vaughn White,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 6, 2022",Why is there so much of a difference?,"Let me start off with the fact that I used to swear by this brand. I completely love it and quite frankly told everybody to by ThermaJohn. Hell, I even bought a couple for my daughter and she loves them (Pink and Purple). In my drawer, I have 3 sets of black, 1 grey, and 1 green. And for some strange odd reason, they are all made differently. The most notable one is the green pair, where it's all shorter than the others, and the shirt makes me think it was designed for a woman for how much the damn neckline goes down. Not tight like the other pairs either. Then I started looking at them and I realized that all 3 pairs of black Thermajohns are made differently. This is a deal breaker for me. I would love to buy more, I quite frankly need more, but if I can't trust them to have a set size for a certain size, then how am I suppose to be happy with their product? I hope y'all get back to me on this issue soon, because this is the most frustrating thing since it is the colder weather time here in Omaha, NE, USA and I can't trust this brand anymore."
Karla Browner,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 20, 2022","Incorrect size sent twice, don't buy these they will not be right!!!","Ordered these for my brother in a 4xl. Received them but in a medium. So obviously they wouldn't have fit him. So, I called Amazon to make a return and to make sure that I would be receiving the correct size that was ordered the first time. I was assured by Amazon rep that they would in fact be shipping a 4xl to me. Well, guess what still received a damn medium. Someone at ThermaJohn/Amazon is obviously not doing their job or they can't read. Will be returning this unusable product for a complete refund. I will not EVER purchase another product from ThermaJohn again. They can suck it for all I care. If this is how they do business then they should go out of business!"
BargainHunter,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 18, 2022",What’s the point?,"When I first bought these my expectations were for them to help keep me warm in cold weather. These do NOT do that…at all!!  The material feels nice. Snugs the body so you will have no issue wearing these under clothes. Don’t expect these to retain any heat for the body. These actually make you feel colder than you were when worn. They might be ok in a warm house but don’t you dare go out in the cold!  It’s like I can hear the cold laugh at me when I walk outside. “Is that supposed to keep you warm?”…“Is it working?”  My answer, two words, can you guess?"
Fred Kerby,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 7, 2022",If your a large man DO NOT BUY,Don’t buy!I read the reviews before buying and because of most of them said order next size up because they run small. I ordered 2 sizes larger than what I wear just to be safe. I normally wear a X-Large  with a 44 waist. I ordered a 3xxxl the largest they have and the shirt was so small I almost ripped it. I was able to get the pants on but way to tight?Don’t buy!!!
pra4america,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022",do not wear white under shirt,"as usual, followed wash instructions prior to wear. husband wore a white t-shirt underneath and thermajohn top faded purple all around his white t-shirt neckline. unfortunately, I do not know how to attach a photo for all to view (still in the 19th century)."
bookwormgirl222,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",Too short! Wearing as shorts.,"I am so mad. I bought these for my brother as a birthday gift. He's 6'2"", 180 lbs. Got the XXLarge as recommended. He just opened them and told me the pants are so short, they don't fit his 12-year-old daughter! That's ridiculous!"
Sherri Park,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 24, 2022",Too Small,I ordered this product in a 2X for my husband. It was slightly tight so I ordered this 3X. The 3X arrived and it's very small. The package and the shirt are both labeled as 3X but it is too tight to be useful. Would you send me a properly labeled 3X product?
J.M.,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 8, 2022","Sentthe wrong size, twice","Ordered a 3xl set and recieved an XL, Then placed return order for the correct size and recieved a small. Can't even wear the item although it looks to be of good quality."
Tired Marine,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 5, 2022","Cheap, not cold weather gear!","The fabric used is not equivalent to Polarguard or any other quality material typically used for performance thermal underwear. These ""long johns"" are at best suitable for use in 40 - 50 degree weather. They have the sleek form fitting appearance of ""Yoga"" pants. I would not recommend them for any serious outdoor exposure in below freezing temperatures. This especially holds true if you are in any way expecting to be in any back country or remote location where your life depends on retaining body heat for survival! To get the quality fabric that really represents mid to expedition weight long johns expect to pay between $60.00-$90.00 each for tops or bottoms. The old adage ""you get what you pay for"" holds true. As an example I have a Woolrich coat my dad purchase @ 1930 that I still wear today and is as serviceable today as is was over 90 years ago! I also have thermal long johns I purchased @ 1970 that are considered ""expedition weight"" that have kept me warm at over 6500 feet elevation at @ 20 below zero. Pay the extra cost to get quality equipment that will last a lifetime!"
John Que,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022",Not warm and extremely thin (ripped),"Ripped along seam at first use.  Did very little for warmth in 40 degree, windy weather.  Guess you really do get what you pay for...stick with Under Armor"
Big Joe,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022",Don't bother,"They were beautiful when they came, beautiful color, really nice smooth feel but it's sad to say that after only one wear they beaded up like crazy and now look very old and worn. I will not recommend these nor will I ever purchase again"
Christopher Ludwig,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 8, 2022",Shirt sized way too small and not very strong material.,"Ordered a size larger than I normally wear due to reviews.  Bottoms fit well.  Top is way small.  Both are warm and comfortable, despite the size issue.  Put a hole in the top with my finger while taking it off the 2nd time I wore it.  Finger popped right through the material, not a seam.  Not real impressed overall."
K.W.,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",Too thin for cold weather.,"Fleece is microscopic. Thin fabric; not warm. But fit is perfect: for my waist size 36, extra large was a perfect fit."
Jeff Behringer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 23, 2022",Way too small.,I understand it’s compression but it’s still way way too small. 4xl is no different then 2xl it’s tight not just form fitting.
Jacqueline Creamer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 7, 2022",This is an okay product.,"They are soft and warm and true to size, not cotton knit. Shouldn't be the first displayed option for thermal underwear, it's not the standard. I wanted a quick buy and thought oh a best seller, must be good. The tag has worn away and I cannot use these. I tried, but they're awful."
Joe,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 14, 2022",product will be returned,"The product was too small and will have to be returned. Always thought medium size was a 34 waist, not a 32""."
RG,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 2, 2022","Size are small , for rice diet people !!!","Sizes are small , for a rice diet person onlyPlus they make a difficult to try to return or up size  ,they also try to spin you in the other Direction to go back to your hole .A  Happy AmazonCustomer !!!"
chris,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 23, 2022",They’re not what they used to be.,"The stitching is already coming out, pay more money and get better thermals."
Jake Dunn,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 13, 2022",Runs waaaaaay small.,Runs probably 2 sizes too small
Evelina Arellano,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 27, 2022",Fit,Cold weather. It was small for 4x and too short.
Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 2, 2022","Top too small, bottoms just right","Got for hubby, is an average body shape, not over weight, not hugely buff in chest, size medium. Bottoms are great, fit good, add a great layer of warmth.  Top is too tight, he will not wear it. And this is a guy who likes tight fitting clothes, and heavy blankets on the bed. He does not like how tight this top is! I wish I could return just the top and get the next size up for top only! Something to be said for buying separate tops and bottoms!"
Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022",Very soft and warm but sizing runs way too small.,I’m about 6’2-“6’3” and around 200lbs-210lbs (I’m tall and lanky) and the XLs were way too small. I get that they are supposed to be snug but the company needs to fix their sizing charts. The bottoms were too short and the top was like wearing a crop top that was 3 sizes too small.I’ll be returning and getting a XXL or XXXL. They are VERY soft and warm. Felt very high quality. But the whole sizing thing is a huge buzz kill.
David,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022",Pretty Green. Nice material.,"At the time of this review, I had not tried on the long johns. I purchased them to wear while running during the cold months. Upon removing the items from the bag, right off, the color was vibrant and the material of good quality.I am sure it will fit as expected but will look great when I've slimmed down a bit."
Catie & Steven,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 11, 2022",Way to small,Ordered my normal size in clothes and it was too small.  Luckily this fit my son that is 3 sizes down from me.
Veronica Faye,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 20, 2022",Way way tight for a 3x,"My husband usually wears 1x bottoms & 2x shirts. So I purchased a 3x after reading some reviews that indicated it ran a little small. He got into them, but after a few hours, he couldn’t wait to take them off. He liked them enough that I just ordered the 4x.  I hope that size works better for him."
Andy,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 29, 2022",Quality of fabric.,It was pretty much what I expected for a lower price point pair of long underwear. Major reason for the markdown in my rating was for the pilling the fabric had on the outer surface after just one wearing.
ZodiacKing,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 18, 2022","Silky,silky,silky- smooth","I’m not sure what to think 🤔 about this. First off it does seem like a onesizefitsall elastic type stretchy fabric that just hugs your body like some kind of spandex or yoga pants w/ women. Which isn’t bad per-say maybe it’s just me but my reason for buying this was for warmth. To have an extra pair so that I don’t over use what I already had before buying this. Now if it’s just a cool sunny day maybe a little breeze maybe you’re near a body of water whatever. Then yeah it’s not bad it’s very breathable like almost too much. I wear extra layers to feel warm, cause it takes time for my body to warm up and I can’t retain heat. The doctor said I need more iron and fiber in my diet. Even in the summer I’m cold. I’m not going to return it, I do like that it came in my favorite color, but I wouldn’t buy this again. I’ll just have to put other layers over it when the temperature drops. But I can’t just wear this if I expect to feel warm. I do like that it feels silky and slides on me so smoothly lol I’m not used to putting on any clothes with that type of material and again good that it’s in my favorite color but I feel it’s more for show like under a checkered shirt or something. But not practical as in not warm enough to be considered a long-Jon but again as I said maybe it’s just me, no two people are the same and I’m sure to someone else it might be warmer or even maybe hot.Thanks for reading 📖 👍🏾"
Sarah,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 28, 2022",Warm but do not hold up well,Ordered these for ski season.  By the end of day 1 they had picks and pills all over them from rubbing against the bibs.  My son said they were very warm though.
B. Crommett,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 23, 2022","Nice material, SUPER small.","I generally wear a 2x. After reading reviews, I ordered a size up. It was still nowhere near big enough. My L son put the set on today and it fit him well. So. Very small. Can’t comment on how warm is is."
joe,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022",Sizing is odd,"I purchased this set in XL. The top fits perfect, the bottoms are at least a size too big."
joshua christine,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 24, 2022","Great product, very comfortable, but size chart is misleading","I loved how comfortable and silky the product was. It also looks really nice under my other clothes, and since the material is so silky, my other clothes don't stick to it or abrade against it like classic thermals do.It also may be a little warmer than classic thermals, but it its not like super warm to the point you can wear just that in very cold weather.Its only slightly warmer than a classic thermal--not that that is a bad thing, frankly its good in many scenarios, but if you are looking for something heavy duty to keep you warm during very cold weather without having to wear layers over it, you should purchase something else, something designed for that.Additional MAJOR WARNING, the size chart they show you is WAY OFF, they say get a size Large if you are like a 34-38 waist, but I am a 32 waist, and the sleeves barely reached to the end of my arm, they are also loose at the wrist, not tight around the wrist like they're shown in the photos, and the waist of the shirt is not very snug either, granted, I am 6'1 and thin; the models in the photos are likely shorter and thicker, but just a warning to any purchasers out there, they don't make a size tall.If you are tall you DEFINITELY need to size up, otherwise you're going to have take a trip to the l'Amazon drop off return center, but if you size up the shirt is going to very wide at the waist and the pant waist will likely need to be hemmed.I just bought the WEERTI thermal of the same polyester type, and it is a little bit longer, still a little short for me, but a little longer both on the sleeves and pant legs, maybe an inch or half inch and it is tighter both at the wrists and waist, additionally the waist on the pants has an actual underwear elastic waist band on it, unlike the Therma John brand which doesn't.So, I have to say the waistband on the WEERTI brand is better, but regarding the fit, I cant say one is necessarily better, if your are shorter and wider, the Therma-John may be for you.But, if you are taller, or even just thin, or maybe not even really thin but want to show off your physic or want a snug fit because it is warmer, get the WEERTI.As I said I am 6'1, thin 155 lbs, muscular, and the WEERTI is still a bit short, but it's longer than the Therma John, and again the fit is more snug which is better for a slender build.Just trying to help ya'll, if my review was helpful please let Amazon know so I can keep writing non-biased quality reviews.-Thanks"
Don,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022",It fit and it's warm,"This rating is about my new long John's not Amazon's botched delivery.1.  A product with the same materials and temperance but no name is available for $20 less.  I went with this one because of offered vendor protections.  So far no need for the provided help.2. It fits well!3. Comfortable, go fleece.4. Warm, just like they are supposed to be.SummaryAs advertised, specific to size, fit, and warmth.  It was as advertised is not five stars.  Planning on buying some more in January."
Cristie,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022",Not as warm as we thought it should be,"I purchased this for my husband's B-Day to wear under hid jogging pants, as he jogs, daily. This product wasn't as warm as we thought it should be. But it is more comfortable than wearing two pairs of pants. After three washes, the inner thighs stared to fray. But it is still better than wearing two pairs of jogging pants. With that being said, I still purchased more for him, for Xmas; as he says it's better than wearing two pairs of pants!"
qwertyyuhxjbdhjgugugggg,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022",Pretty good product,"I’ve worn poly long underwear for decades. These are amongst the thinnest I’ve ever owned. These are definitely undersized and you must order up one size. I’m 6’3” 220 and usually wear an xl in long underwear but after reading the review I ordered XXL.They fit well and I think will be a decent base layer. I hand to dry because if they shrink, they become someone else’s hand me downs.  They are soft, and very very stretchy. Not sure how durable they will end up being."
barry hinshaw,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",I ordered a MEDIUM and should have ordered LARGE.,"These are a good, lightweight set of long underwear.  I'm 6' tall and 170 lbs with a 33"" waist.  I should have gotten the LARGE size."
DP,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 11, 2022",For men but a lady can wear,"Soft smooth silky, men’s wear underpants fit great, soft to skin, lot of girls wear men thermal, could be a little thicker"
Patton,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 3, 2022",Go bigger than you think.,"I wear a 36” waist and 44” jacket and got the XL…WAY to small. Ended up getting the 2xl, also not big enough and finally the 3XL was the one that fit."
Gregory I. Gewickey,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",Pretty good product for cold nights,The shirt was tighter than I wanted but overall they are good. The pants are about right.
Gabriel E.,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 2, 2022",Un poco corto,"Pedí talla XL pero sin embargo me queda un poco corto en los brazos y en los pies, se recomienda comprar una talla mas grade de lo habitual."
Brittney Pullum,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 22, 2022",For comfortability go up a size,My husband said it keeps him warm while working in and out of the cold weather. I do recommend going up a size to avoid it being itchy against the skin. Will be buying more for the both of us… just in a size bigger than actual fitting.
Bard of Asher,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022",Silky,"I use these for the obvious reason, they really do well for what they are made for, and on my motorbike in the winter its an essential. These fit nice and snug, are very comfortable, and warm. I bought the size indicated for my waist and the fit is perfect. A size smaller would have also worked but I am glad I followed the size chart as these are not tight but they do fit snug. They do not chaff and I wear them for 12 hour shifts with lots of running/walking."
Dobees#1,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022",Excellent product,"I was skeptical about these thermals, but they actually fit pretty snug and keep you warm! We've had a pretty cold fall so far here in Southern CA, colder than I'm used to, so with these thermals, I'm ready for Winter. The only thing I would suggest is to purchase more than one pair since it seems they wear out faster than I thought, you know when fabric starts getting those clumps of lint in your wrist and back areas. I've also heard they're great for motorcycle riders."
D Lynn,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 11, 2022",Keeps me warm,"I had other thermals that were a little thicker. They weren’t keeping me that warm, so I decided to try these. These are not as thick, but keep me warm and are very comfortable and soft. I’m a valet Parker, so in the cold for 8 hours with cold winds. Temperatures in the high 30’ s and 50’ s. I live in Vegas so that’s cold for me."
Cristina,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022",Great base layer for scout camp,"My son wore this as a base layer at Boy Scout camp over Thanksgiving break. I didn’t know how well the thermals were going to work bc he is ALWAYS cold and always complains about it. It was in the 30s most days but he stayed nice and warm and had no complaints about being cold. I ordered a men’s small thinking it may be a bit loose on my skinny teen, but it fit perfect.  Will definitely buy again."
James Gash,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 2, 2022",Worth it,"I live in my semi truck for weeks at a time and keep my truck off to save on fuel (diesel ain’t cheap nowadays) and it can get down to 20 degrees Fahrenheit in my truck. I put these on when I was cool one day and man, it was actually making me sweat while I could see my own breath. Definitely worth the buy if you’re in fluctuating temps and need to get hot fast. It was a little small but I assume that’s just because it’s form fitting"
CH,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 26, 2022",Perfect base layer for cold weather,"Purchased this set for my high school band kid who was marching at a football game in 32-degree weather with a wind chill of 28-degrees.They're a perfect base layer - not bulky like the old-style, waffle-knit cotton thermals underwear. They're supposed to fit snugly against the body (not tight) and they're made from a soft, smooth, silky knit fabric that doesn't bunch up or cause you to sweat and trap moisture against your skin. My kid was warm and comfortable wearing these, and now wants more to wear as pajamas!"
Manuel Galindo III,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",Needed new base layers for Snowboarding,These seem to be a great fit. I tried them on the other day and they fit my refectory and are nice and warm. They say they’re moisture wicking which is necessary in the snow. I’ll still have to test them on the mountain but it seems like a great cheaper alternative than some popular snow brands gear
Jenny Scott,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 11, 2022",For husband,"We live in the Midwest, and even on days it’s not snowing— it’s cold. We work at a dealership and my husband is outside a lot. I’ve bought him several types of base layers- but he likes these the best. They fit as expected and they are very warm. Highly recommend!"
Kevin G,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 20, 2022",Very nice!!!!,"I was looking for a good was to stay warm while running outside in the winter. Sure enough, everyone has been right. These thermals are awesome! Opposed to every other guy, I'm 6'1"" and come in at 330lbs. Not all of that weight is muscle though. The XXl is a little long so I tuck it into my shoes to keep me covered in the cold rain. The fleece lining doesn't keep the sweat or rain trapped against my skin. Yes I'm a bit damp after running in the rain, But it doesn't feel like I'm all soggy. I have returned to but a few pairs and just ordered some for my wife."
mike k,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 20, 2022",I went up a size .,I’m 5:11 and 180lbs. and about a 34 waste.I got the XL .Perfect fit. A little snug like they are supposed to be.I was worried the waist was going to be too tight … and be uncomfortable all day.Nope … the XL fits my 34 waste perfectly.The only thing I don’t know at this point is … are they going to shrink.I’ll update after washing.These are really nice and they look good.They don’t look like the usual “ hey you’re wearing thermal underwear” .I’d recommend these 100%They are not cheap … they are quality which I really wasn’t expecting because of the low price.
Raltar,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 23, 2022",They changed the product for something that wears out in 1 day,"Like many others have noticed, the socks they sent to me are completely changed from the similar product that used to sell under this listing.  What was at one time a fairly standard type of sock came to me in the most recent order extremely thin and small-sized.  I decided to give them a chance anyway and I ended up wearing holes in these socks in a few hours of wearing them indoors.  They were rather uncomfortable, too.  It is quite possible that I got a counterfeit that was never made by Fruit of the Loom, but whatever the case it seems I was not the only one.  Be sure to check the reviews, not just the stars!I ended up throwing the rest of the socks away.  I had these on the shelf too long before opening them and learning that they weren't the same, and the first pair looked like they had been worn for weeks after the first day, with large holes in the bottoms.  It's terrible to have such wastage, but these were completely useless to me and I wasn't going to inflict them on anybody else.Pros:At one time, socks sold under this heading and brand were decent.  I even have a few pair of them left, and they look almost identical.Cons:- Very thin and weak material: wears holes comically fast- Runs small compared to size guide- The ones I got were either counterfeit or Fruit of the Loom has decided its brand is worthless.  I hope it's the former."
Brett,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",Fall apart after a few washes,"I dont review a lot of products, and I know this is a drop in the bucket, but maybe someone will see and go elsewhere because FotL brand stuff is just garbage nowadays.  In 3 months I have multiple pairs of socks with holes, and most of the elastic is blown out of them.  They weren't the warmest or most comfortable to begin with, so they get a zero across the board."
Amazon Customer,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022",Just awful socks,Just awful. Second wear after one wash and this is 2nd pair out of bundle that this has occured. How do companies sell this crap?
Mt,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 14, 2022","They rotate and drift slowly while you are wearing them, which is quite annoying!","Although they fit my feet and are not loose at all, they slowly rotate such that after a while their toes (especially the right one) are completely dislocated from where they should be, which looks ugly and it is annoying too."
Drawde,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 30, 2022",Very Thin,I did not like anything about these socks. They are way too thin and too small. I suggest you keep looking. I previously purchased the Burlington Comfort Power Men's Quarter Socks and they were great. No comparison. Lesson learned.
Paul Guerra,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 12, 2022",Does not help with moisture at all,Idk why these came up for helping with atheletes foot should’ve known better by the brand but yeah these r not the business
Amazon Customer,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 21, 2022",Don't waste your money,"uncomfortable, after just one cycle in the wash the seams are fraying apart and unraveling making it highly uncomfortable to wear. Will definitely not be buying this brand anymore"
J K,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 23, 2022",Yikes,Those are not for adults! Those socks are so damn tight and make it look like my feet are 10 sides is smaller than the rest of my body. What a waste of money again from amazon! Big surprise
Spud,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 18, 2022",6-12 but they are too tight on a 9 foot,6-12 but they are too tight on a 9 foot. Ive been buying these fro the store for years but these are not the size as marked.
Chuck,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 11, 2022",Absolute Junk.  Doesn't appear to be Fruit of the Loom,I have worn Fruit of the Loom socks for years.  These are small and THIN.  Like nylon stockings.  So yes they will fit if you yank on them.  They are so tight above my ankles that they cut off the circulation.  Not an athletic sock.  Too thin to absorb any sweat and not cushioning.  Don't like them at all.  Will find better socks elsewhere.  Would have returned if I hadn't opened and worn a pair.  These are going in the trash.
AMZN_Shopper,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 11, 2022","Too many flaws, will not buy again.","No matter how I put these socks on, twist them, adjust them I cannot stop the front outsize of the sock where the toe seem is to stop ending up in front of my pinky toe. It just constantly feels like there's something in the front of my sock or shoe and is incredibly annoying. There's just too much excess fabric in the corner where the grey toe portion is attached and no amount of twisting or adjusting the sock will stop that ball of fabric from getting back to the front of your outer toes as the day goes on.I also suspect they're not gonna last more than a few wears each. The fabric is thin on them to the point they're almost like some dress socks. When pulling them on you can see right through the seems, especially where the toe/heel portions are attached. I won't be buying again."
fred mardis,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022",No good,Cheap socks pretty close to worse I ever bought.  Will not buy again!
justin,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 20, 2022","Didn’t realize they’re those spandex like socks, not a fan at all","Didn’t realize they’re those spandex like socks, not a fan at all"
jellybean,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 10, 2022",Tight!,Its the right size but the sock is tight. Its made for a skinny foot and skinny ankle. Its tight on me let alone my husband. Don't care for them.

Just an Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 26, 2022",Not what I wanted,When they wrote ankle socks I thought they meant going and ending at the bottom-top of the ankle. These socks go over the ankle a bit.Also they are a little tight at the top which doesn't supp. good circul.I definitely like the price of these! It is reasonable. Why can't they make ankle socks in 12-pairs that cost this much? ~$10-12 It's less material!!It's good if it's what you're looking for. The wording could be more clear and bett. b/c it is misleading.These two reasons are why I took off two stars.

Joe A. Kopf,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 5, 2022",Not sold on them,"I bought a big pack of these to replace my myriad of old unmatched socks and I'm not 100% sold.

Huey,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 24, 2022",Great pair of socks with one issue,"They are just as comfy as any pair from comparable brands and fit perfectly. The only issue I have is that they have a line or stitching just at or above the toes that are uncomfortable. I wear em with my work boots and adjust them to where it's unnoticeable but with my regular sneakers, it can be felt. Not a huge deal but  definitely note worthy."

Ashley Maki,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022","Cheaply Made, Highly Disappointed",I had bought these pants as an outfit for my husband and couldn't be more dissatisfied with these pants. I was really a promoter of Champion products and never thought that I would pay this much for a pair of pants that should be good quality and warm and were nothing but the opposite. The pants themselves are thinner than a Hanes tshirt for comparison and quality is sub par at that. My husband put his hand in the pockets to see the depth and the stitching came apart on one of the pockets. Not even worth the time I spent ordering them! Shame on you Champion!!
gshillare,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 28, 2022",Pretty cheap Threw them away before they were washed even ONCE!,The cuffs on both legs lost elasticity after wearing a few times.  I did not even wash them yet.  Save your money I guess it is my fault thinking I could but something this cheap and it would be worth while  but gosh they could have made it to the first washing one would think....put them on yesterday and tripped over the cuffs which no longer cling to my legs....waste is starting to go now....terrible!!!!!!!!!
Jay T.,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 10, 2022",Paper thin and scratchy,"This was definitely not as expected. I don't know if it was a lack of attention to detail on my part..but I was certainly disappointed in the quality and thinness of these pants. I was expecting something a little thicker and softer that would help keep some warmth in during the fall months, however these seem to be something you might use in the summer and even then the material is scratchy. Needless to say not happy andI don't feel that these are even worth $18 :/"
SHIH-CHIEH KAO,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 8, 2022",Color runs,Purchased black and tried to hand wash to observe if the color runs. Glad I did so because it was disastrous!

Trishia M.,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 22, 2022",Not 100% cotton,I may have misread this but this is the fourth pair of pants I bought thinking they were 100% cotton. They're not and it's kinda hard to miss the 90% cotton and 10% polyester seeing as it's blatant so I'm convinced I didn't misread it. Probably changed it. Sending back these nasty things.

Nick R,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 28, 2022",Terrible material,Pants were made of really cheap material and paper thin. Really bad quality if this is a true champion product and I do not recommend buying these
E-money,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 31, 2022",Will Not Keep You Warm,"These pants are categorized as sweatpants which I’m pretty sure means they should be a bit thicker of a material than leggings, but nonetheless these are not. You will be cold if you wear these, be prepared for that."
Rachel,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 12, 2022",I should have read the description on this one a bit closer,"This was not what I expected, these will more than likely be ripped by my son within the first or second wearing.  The material is very thin.  The product in the picture looks as if it is thicker than what I got.  I was under the impression that these were a pair of sweat pants.  They are as thick as a t-shirt, not something I would trust as a pair of pants.  They are for Christmas so I can't even say if they fit, although they do look like they will.  I am just disappointed in the quality.  Skip them if you plan on wearing them anywhere besides to bed...to risky"
Henry L.,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022","Cheap material, very thin.",Thought these would be awesome value being on sale for $15 and Champion being a well known brand. But found the material very cheap and thin. I have cotton joggers from unknown brands bought on eBay from 8 years ago that are higher quality than these. Uniqlo even has better quality joggers than these and cheaper MSRP (ie. full tag price).

I ordered ""large"" & while the length is good, they're tight everywhere......calves, thighs, butt, waist. If you're skinny they'd be comfortable. If you've got some muscle they'll be tight. If you're overweight........look for something else."
Taylor,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 27, 2022","Thin, stiff material",The length and fit of the pants is as expected however the material is much thinner than anticipated. It’s like a thin cotton t-shirt. It would not be very good for cold weather. It’s also very stiff cotton material but we haven’t washed them yet so they may soften over time. I’m glad I got these at 50% off as I don’t think they’re worth the full cost.
Julia ,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 29, 2022",Disappointed,I bought these for my son I wanted something more short in the inseam and they are way to long I had put the size of the inseam for 29 and there more like a 33 inch  so someone else in the house can be able to where them this is why I really don't like ordering online
Jay,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 8, 2022",Tight compared to similar products,These are rather tight joggers compared to similar products. They seem a little thin and don’t have much strength to them. But they are cozy for around the house. Not sure I’d wear them outside with how they fit a little tighter than expected.
R.M.,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 27, 2022",Fabric is thin,The fabric of these pants is very thin. I only recommend it if you're not using them for cold weather. They can also break from the stitching.

Ryan K,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 23, 2022",Mostly Happy,"These fit me nicely except for the calves where they are quite tight and then it causes the pants below the calves to bunch up some.

Son wanted to have some super comfortable yet cool-looking sweatpants to wear to school and he is really into sweatpants. In fact, that is all he wears so we have a few. He knows good sweatpants when he sees/wears one. LOL- soft and doesn't shrink or lose fabric integrity when washed- side pockets are excellent as well- Versatile. Son wears these pants with tennis shoes, flats, and those Vans shoes. He also wears to school and at home lounging around.THE BAD- Nothing so farTHE VERDICT:Will re-purchase once he wears this one out :))"

nwoods581,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 29, 2022",Style over Function,"This shirt is clearly designed for the inner city millennial looking for that rugged edge with their man bunn and their latte. I live in the north country where flannel means warmth. this shirt missed the tweet about it. it provides no more warmth than a pair of skinny jeans. as for functionality, someone thought hey lets make a flannel that has a taper cut to better fit less people. the shoulders are roomy and the chest slightly less so and the further down you get the tighter it is. now mind you i am not a tiny little tulip, and i know i downed a few to many coors over the years, but if this shirt were cut straight from the shoulders, it would have fit darn near perfect all the way down. I even had the foresight to get a tall to cover my derriere so that i couldn't be mistaken for a plumber from behind.  sent this confused shirt back to its safe space so that it might be able to find its true identity as dish rag.

George,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 18, 2022",Stay away from Legendary Whitetail,"I purchased this jacket around 30 days ago. Firstly , the materials are wonderful. The Jacket ""wears"" great. However, the stitching was poor in the armpit area, creating a hole. I contacted Amazon, who said the item was not able to be returned or exchanged. I then called the manufacturer, who said they do not honor warranty's if this Jacket is bought through any vendors; You have to buy it on the Whitetails website to have any quality guarantee's. This makes me wonder if Amazon is an authorized vendor. Whitetail next offered me a 50% discount to buy the same item again directly from them....but would not accept an exchange from an Amazon Whitetail item. I had to argue and escalate the issue to get any action....I had to send my amazon receipt and pictures of the damaged item.

Unfortunately, after the 1st wash, the collar separated from the body of the shirt and I had to return the shirt for a refund. That's why I mostly buy from Amazon. Refunds are no problem here.Take a look at the soft material on these collars. They are not conducive to being sewn to the corduroy and I believe will pull loose in every shirt."

This company simply doesn’t make a shirt that equates to any other standard sizing.I’m 5’8 and about 160-170 lbs (depending on what I ate that week.) I wear a medium in everything. Always have. Always fits fine. I read reviews that these run large, but a lot of those reviews were 3-4 years old, so I hoped they had resolved the sizing issue.I ordered 2 shirts in medium. The mediums are so long they sit closer to my knees than my belt line. The sleeves are long enough to cover half my hands. But width and shoulder wise, they fit fine. I exchanged them for smalls. The smalls are almost identical in length to the medium. So the small did absolutely nothing to rectify my issue with the very long length of the medium. The only difference is there’s slightly less shoulder room in the small. Leaving a shirt that’s still way too long, but now won’t button up comfortably. Neither size works for me at all.I’ve attached pictures showing the sizes of both the “small” and “medium” sizes of this shirt, compared to a “medium” size Roebuck and Co flannel that I’ve had for years, that fits like a true medium sized shirt.You can see in the pictures that both the Legendary Whitetails “small” and the “medium” are much longer than the Roebuck and Co. red “medium” size shirt that fits me well, and is comparable to any other medium shirt I have. You can also see in the pictures, how the Legendary Whitetails “small” and “medium” size shirts are almost identical in length. The picture of the green shirt shows the “small” size buttoned up. Notice how I barely fit into the shirt from a width and shoulder standpoint. I wouldn’t be able to button it and wear it comfortably, but it’s still very long. Does this company make shirts for Slender Man? I don’t understand the extremely long length in the sizing. Maybe they’re meant to be tucked in? Too long for my taste.I find it funny how someone left a review defending the sizing, saying these shirts aren’t for “skinny jean wearing boys” and that they’re long because they’re a “man’s shirt.” But then immediately says they ordered a size smaller than they usually wear, and even after drying the shirt is still too long. Proving that even people trying to defend the sizing, still have the same issue. I shouldn’t have to wash and dry a shirt to get true sizing. Besides, there’s no way the medium would shrink THAT much. And if I wash it, now I can’t return it.As far as the quality goes; it’s OKAY. The material actually feels pretty good, but for a company that can’t get simple sizing right, they don’t deserve to have a good trait listed first in a review.The overall built quality is fine. There’s some loose threads hanging out of buttons, or random spots with stitching popping out for no apparent reason. But nothing terrible. For $30, there’s certainly nothing I can’t overlook. Honestly, if the shirts had fit fine, I would have easily over looked these issues, kept the shirts, and not even mentioned it in the review. But since other people, possibly you, might not be okay with such quality issues, I listed them. See attached pictures.A full two weeks after my original order, I’ve now exchanged them for smalls, and am now returning all of them. I’ll take my business elsewhere. If the extra length is fine with you, you shouldn’t have any issues."
jck,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022","(used to be) great shirts, horrible service","I've purchased 10 legendary white tail shirts. I first bought 4 of them from sierra trading, and now 6 from amazon.Though I used to love the shirts because they tailor a LT, I'm done with them.Wrong sizes, buttons missing, wrong colors, wrong styles... that's AMAZON orders.That's for 5 out of the 6 I've bought on Amazon. I've always shrugged it off because they were on sale, and I'd either fix them myself, wear them as shop shirts, or give them away. Not this time. I'm done, and you need to know the truth.You are getting something slightly better than a Walmart shirt for 3x the price.I just opened a ""cedarwood plaid"" I purchased for a Christmas gift. It isn't even close to the picture unless you are colorblind.picture: grey, blue, tan, cream white, redactual shirt: scarlet purple, veridian green, mustard, mud-white...I've had it with this company. If you can't even get a photo correct...and that's looking at it on three different devices, so it's on you LW.I've also noticed the quality is dropping as the prices are increasing even though they are now using China, so again, I'm done.(in the beginning LW had their shirts made in the south pacific)I'll be shocked if this review is allowed, but it needs to be said: the product and service is junk, yet the prices are close to ""premium"".I'll find better, and so can you."
Josephi,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 25, 2019",Quality can be good or poor depending on where it's made,"I bought one of these shirts several months ago in the Shale Plaid style and was satisfied with the overall quality, so recently decided to purchase another in the Cedarwood Plaid style.  I noticed on the label that the Cedarwood Plaid shirt was made in India, while the Shale Plaid shirt was made in China.  After one wash/dry cycle following the directions on the label, I found that the Cedarwood Plaid's fabric had pilled much more than the Shale Plaid shirt had after multiple washings.  Another thing I noticed is that the backside reinforcement stitching for the top corners of the shirt pocket on the Cedarwood Plaid shirt was done using small pieces of scrap fabric that were already unraveling.  Just seemed like a very messy and low quality way of doing it.  The same backside stitching on the Shale Plaid shirt was done much more neatly and looks strong.The Chinese made shirt seems to be much higher in overall quality than the shirt made in India.  I don't know if that's going to be the case with all of the shirts in this line.  I ended up buying a fuzz remover to get rid of the pilling on the new shirt and had to empty the collection compartment twice.  After ironing it, it now looks decent, but it took more time and effort and extra expense than it should have for a $30 shirt, IMHO.  I think Legendary Whitetails should follow up on their quality control more closely."
MikeD,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 12, 2022",Cheaper fabric in 2022,"I bought two of these a few years ago and loved them.  They were a nice light/medium weight soft cotton flannel. I just bought a new one a few weeks ago and the fabric is noticeably thinner.  My older ones, held up to a light, you can barely see the light through the fabric, even after countless washes.  The new one from this year (2022) is so thin with a much looser weave that light is easily seen through the fabric.  Even after a few washes the weave and density of the fabric is inferior to the older fabric.  Such a shame that in order to maintain profits another company cuts quality.  I won't be buying another shirt from them since it is no longer a product that balances material and value."
ponz,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 30, 2022","Medium too small, large way too long","I really wish these Legendary whitetail shirts fit as well as they look. I'm 5'10"" 205lbs with a toned muscular build. I've tried the medium and large sizes of these shirts and there really needs to be an in-between size. The medium was too tight through the chest and shoulders but the length was right. The large in comparison fits like an XL... way too big. I could gain 50 lbs and the large would still be loose."
M. Zajic,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 12, 2022",Must be ironed,"I really liked the color and pattern.  Fit was good, too.  But, when it arrived and I felt the fabric, I could hardly believe it was so very thin.  Not the thick weave associated with winter wear men's flannel shirts.  The problem is it is all cotton .  Because it is so thin a fabric it will wrinkle easily  and require ironing every time it is washed and in between as well.  It will not hold up.  Spend you money on something that will look better.  I returned mine."
Because Pizza,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 18, 2022",This doesn’t feel true to size.,"I ordered a large, it was too small and looks like I’m exploding out of it with the buttons fastened and it was a bit short so my belly hangs out of it, I thought I would try an XL-Tall but that was gigantic and I was basically swimming in it. So I exchanged it for an XL, which is HUGE as well. I’m about to cut my losses and return for a refund."
David Kephart,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 26, 2022","Shrunk, bummed","I tried this on when I got it and was very excited as a 6'4"" guy to find another option for Large Tall other than Eddie Bauer. Great fit, especially arm length and past belt, also pretty soft, it looked great. I washed it once and it SHRANK big time. Would not buy again. Bummed out."
Fred Dopps,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 8, 2022",Disappointed.,"Shirt was not soft or thick, as new 100% cotton flannel would be, normally.  No close up picture of collar or cuffs gave me the impression they were leather, but my mistake was believing the name brand offered such.  The material was very thin.Lastly, the shirt arrived with 2 books I’d ordered, and there were NO return labels or even order information enclosed.  What has happened to Amazon’s quality of  packing and enclosing such pertinent information?"
ML,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 2, 2022",Low quality,"Got my first Legendary Whitetails flannel shirt and to say that I was disappointed would be an understatement as the quality seems low. All the buttons were loose, and one was ready to fall off at any time. The fabric (not thick but not thin) was soft and would be comfortable but that is about all it got. It was true to my size which is a small. The arms were very baggy. The single covered pocket was smaller than look as it had a separate pen pocket integrated. Based on the loose buttons, I will probably never buy another one again."
T. Pillar,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 22, 2022",Nice look but fit is off,"I bought this for my husband. He has another one in a plaid print and that one is great. The solid navy is a little off. The collar comes around farther on one side than the other. There is also a pleat on the sleeve that isn't on the other shirt, and the sleeves are a little short. Maybe this is just a sewing defect? It is also much thicker in the solid color. I can't return it, but he could always wear it for working outside. It is a nice looking shirt, material-wise, anyway. That's why I gave 3 stars."
Grandao,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 4, 2022",Overrated on Amazon reviews,"The material itself seems of decent quality, but the craftsmanship is lacking. For example, buttons need restitching (and I've washed this shirt ONCE). And the shirt has shrunk inconsistently, there is some puckering between buttons button placket shrunk more than the button hole placket. Lots of loose threads.One thing I found very annoying, the supplier ships this requiring a signature for delivery. It's an inexpensive shirt. It's ridiculous to require a signature, and to receive UPS text messages with links regarding this to actually see what UPS is trying to deliver... hasn't anyone heard of phishing/smishing? An unexpected SMS text message containing a link? That's how you get hacked. Just dumb.Lower quality shirt, ok price, certainly not worthy of the high ratings."
RickB,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 19, 2022",Varying Material Quality,"I like the shirt and see no immediately obvious product quality issues. (Just received it today though). This shirt is comfortable, and apparently well made.What is immediately obvious to me, however, is the quality of the material. This shirt is seemingly about 40 to 50% lighter than the last one that I bought. I would like to be able to spend my hard earned money on a brand that is consistent in its quality. It does not seem that this brand is able to provide that."
Marla Moore,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",Sold us a returned shirt- stuffed into a torn bag,Item was received all unbuttoned and stuffed into a torn bag. Obviously a return that had been resold. Shirt is terribly wrinkled. I will have to iron it before I can give it as a gift.

Joshua Larson,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 5, 2022",This is not for tall people...,"My husband is 6""6"" 230lbs. He is tall and slender, I bought him an xl tall flannel. When his arms are down looks perfect, and the back covers his butt... when he raises his arms the the way above his head the sleeves are too short. I'd say they hit about an inch above his wrist, really disappointing because the color and feel aof the shirt are nice but I wish there were more options for tall men, and this one was an xl TALL and it still ends up being an inch too short..."
Keith Cross,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 22, 2022",Shrinks A LOT!,"I bought an XL and returned it because it was huge when I got it and tried it on.

Quality of shirt seems nice otherwise."
cody bunton,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022",Order 1 Size Smaller,These shirts run huge. ordered a Large but the shirt has enough fabric to be considered a XXL.
Andrew Knittle,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",Solid Colors Shrink,"I really like these flannels. I wear between a medium and a large, and the large size fits me well while other brands always seem tight in the shoulders. The only problem is the solid colors seem to be made of a different material than the plaid ones. Even though they both say ""100% Cotton"" and are both made in Cambodia, the solid color ones seem to be made of something closer to felt, and they shrink in the wash! This is especially noticeable in the length of the sleeves; the arms on mine are now about 2 inches shorter than those of the plaid ones I own. If you steer clear of the solid colored ones, these are 5/5 for me. It's unfortunate, though, because I really did want a well fitting solid green flannel."
Randy Moore,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 22, 2022","Good shirt, but runs large.","I purchased this shirt along with a Legendary Whitetails Journeyman shirt jacket, both in size large, and both of them fit more like an extra large. My closet is nothing but size large for shirts and jackets, and while most brands have some variation in their sizing, these were just ridiculous. I did like how they looked and felt though, so decided to exchange them both for a medium size. There's a reason I don't wear medium, because it's too small across my chest and shoulders... and would you believe it their medium fits exactly like a medium. lol. I still kept them both though since I like the way they look, I just can't button them comfortably. Really wish the large fit like a normal large."
Taylor P,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022",Great but came with an unwanted extra,I ordered two of these shirts and after a turn through the washing machine they both fit and feel great. My only negative is that one of the shirts had an intense crinkling sound coming from the fabric void around the shoulders. I made a small cut into the fabric on the inside and pulled out a piece of plastic that had the shirt size and some other numbers on it. This is probably an uncommon factory error but I felt it was worth writing down for a review.Overall I’m still very satisfied with the shirts. My first flannels! Very comfy :)
Mike A,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 3, 2022","nice quality, unfortunate sizing","My only problem with this shirt is the cut/sizing. I was looking for a shirt to be worn untucked, but this shirt is far too long for that. It fits perfectly around my torso and chest but droops down way below my waist. For reference, I'm 5'8"" and fairly slim, and bought a SMALL size.Otherwise the shirt is very nice. The flannel material quality is good and color pattern is pleasant, and the material has a very nice thickness to it."
Virginia Buytkins,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",Colors are not accurate,"I bought 4 of these shirts in different plaids.  Only one was close to the pictured colors.

Ricardo Crespoarce,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022",It’s a flannel shirt,This shirt is 90% what I expect a cotton flannel shirt to be—the missing 10% is because I find the material to be thinner than some of my other shirts…The corduroy trim looks snazzy.
dustin fowler,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022",Quality and comfort,I was surprised at how big this shirt was. I’m a huge guy and I was “swimming” in it the first time I wore it. Washed in hot water and dried with high heat and it shrunk to just the right size.

Linda B,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 5, 2022",Great quality,"There was no claim that it was a stretch or wrinkle-free fabric.  The size is true and my normal size (XL) fit me perfectly.  In fact, the cut is very attractive as are the colors.  The feel is soft and tactile while the fabric is warm and breathable. The fabric is also durable and has a quality look and feel.  It strikes me as a very good value for the price. I bought two shirts (solid blue and solid heather) and I'm very pleased with both of them.  I would buy them again in a heartbeat.

So far I’ve only watched it. I would watch them because I bought a few, Wash them for five times but I have not seen any fading, I’ve not seen any bleed of color from one shirt to the other, or from one shirt to another piece of clothing so the day is a very good day that stays within the product the way it should. Very good product and I would recommend it to anybody and I’m going to buy some more."

For reference, I am a woman, 5'7' and normally an xl in women's tops, and I am not normally too fussy about clothing, especially stuff like this for just hanging around the house/walking the dog. I want a decent fit and comfort, that's how low the bar is set. I wanted something big and cozy so I figured I would buy from the men's section and get it in a larger size to bum around in. I have no clue how men, who usually have thicker necks than women, are dealing with how tight the neckline is! I put it on and could not stand it immediately. The fabric was also scratchy and I was not a fan of the texture. The green color is gorgeous and just like the picture so that was a win, but the only win. I sent this back for a refund because it was such a disappointment. I can't say that it was too small overall, because it wasn't, but that neckline, yikes! Maybe I just got one that was weirdly sewn because I can't imagine how anyone could wear this for any length of time without feeling like they are being choked."

The hoody was also too short if I stretched or bent down there's a noticeable gap (hoody would lift up). Definitely would not recommend for taller people or if you have a longer torso."
BuddyGuy,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 30, 2022",Not 100% cotton like the description states it is. Very misleading,"I purchased this hoodie to wear while in the shop (welding shop).

Another Consumer,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 17, 2022",Sizing is extremely inconsistent,"After reading some reviews I decided to purchase these in 2xl, when I normally wear l or xl depending on fabric and brand. Upon arrival I noticed that the black one was way smaller than the grey yet they both claim to be 2xl. I wore them a few times over the course of a month and a half and noticed that after washing the black one shrinks way more than the grey. Enough to have me wanting to return it for a 3xl (which I've never had to purchase this size in anything). Well I cant. The return window is closed. Now I am stuck with a sweatshirt that barely reaches below my belly button. The grey one fits better but still runs very small compared to my sweatshirts purchased elsewhere. I'm extremely disappointed in this purchase. They fit like a medium and a small after only a small handful of washes. The black one is actually now small enough to fit my son better than me and he is still in grade school. I recommend washing a few times while still in the time frame to return this product so you dont waste your money as I did"

Also worth mentioning is that the size runs very small.  I usually wear a medium, but this fits really tight.

Amazon Customer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 1, 2022",Runs small,"I like to wear shirts in 2XL in men's so that they're oversized and comfy. I figured I'd get a 3XL and have it be like a lightweight Snuggie. The hoodie was super thin, it runs small, the wrists are on the tight side and the opening for your head is too small. I didn't want to deal with returning it so I made a cut about an inch in length to help out with the head opening. I washed it before wearing it out and it shrunk. I'm 5'5"" and it just covers my butt, so it isn't a bad fit but I wanted a very oversized hoodie. I don't think I can recommend this product."
Amazon Customer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 2, 2022",Disappointment,"I ordered it as a 4XL because I like my shirts and sweatshirts big and bulky. It is anything but big and bulky. I would classify it as a 2-3XL. Right in between. The length is definitely not long enough. It is inches off of my t shirt lengths in the same size. I know when I wash it, if I don't catch it and it goes in the dryer it will seem like a 1-2XL. This will be passed on to my oldest. I'm not even going to try to hold out hope.

Totally unprofessional of Amazon.Item itself felt very thin, maybe more for summer cool nights. I was looking for something a little thicker for winter."
J Walters,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 28, 2022","Washed without drying, and its a size smaller.....","I wear a large, and most of the time, the LG size is spot on. This one seemed to be too, but once it was washed (cold cycle) it was as if i had dried it 10 times on high heat and it was almost the size of a medium. Tight fit which was really odd."
Wayfinder,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 27, 2022",Neck has a problem,"Since this hoodie doesn't have a zipper, it can be a problem slipping it over your head.  I have a thin head and it barely fit through the neck.  A larger-headed person might find it impossible.  They really do not make it easy to take this on and off.  I predict a number of men will be returning this simply because they can't slip it on over their head."
Amanda Pascall,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 19, 2022",Do more research on the fabrics and how they work,Ok here im thinking I'm getting this plus size hoodie that I finally found my thing what I got was disappointing one the fabric was I don't know what it was but the min it was washed the color was running lint sticks to it it did not even fit I needed to rip the neck part so I can be comfortable good price but not good on everything else
Kindle Customer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 6, 2022",Order 2 sizes larger but still too short,"I followed the suggestions and ordered 4XL rather than my normal 2XL. I am using this hoodie as a hang around the house garment. The hoodie is cut very short, and barely comes down to my waist. I would estimate it to be 2-3"" shorter than normal.  I'm 6'5"" 250lbs."
Shopaholic 😃,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 6, 2022",To small at the neck area,"I bought this sweater for myself. I bought a mens Large thinking it would be loose an on the bigger side. Well no, this was small at the neck area. I could barely for my head through. Also it is not soft in the inside. I will be returning this"
James,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 22, 2022",Way too short,"This hoodie is super soft and a great price. BUT, when I tried it on it is simply way too short. I wear a men’s Large and this hoodie barely went boast my belt line. Also the waist band on it is very loose. Could be a great “around the house” hoodie just not my type of fitment."
Seriously Not,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 23, 2022",Not sure how long this hoodie is going to last,"Not to heavy, but not as light weight as some of my cool summer night hoodies. Wears well, but could do without the loose strings that need to be cut off after every wash. Makes me wonder how many washes this will actually make it through. Guess we’ll see. I’m hardcore on my hoodie wearing."
Abbey G,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 11, 2022",Disappointed,"Ordered two of the shirts for myself and two for my husband. Ordered my husband an XXL bc he’s tall (6’6”) with an athletic build. It was too wide for him. I purposefully bought mine one size bigger (medium) for an oversized look (I’m 5’8”), but it was too long for me and more oversized than I thought it’d be. We were also disappointed in the quality. While soft, the sweatshirt is quite thin. Being from Hanes we thought we’d be getting a nicely structured hoodie that was cozy, but made in a heavier cotton material. For the price, it’s not surprising that the hoodie is made from a thinner cotton material. If you’re looking for a lightweight sweatshirt, this is it. If you’re looking for a more structured hoodie made from a thicker material, this isn’t what you want."
Lori Mileur,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022",Fits fine except head and neck,"Bought 5XL the shirt fits just fine however the manufacturer needs to consider when makining larger clothing that the persons neck and head are also larger too.  I was @&#&#$@ when I asked my husband how he like the sweatshirt he said yep fits great now that I cut the neck in the middle front so I could get it to go over my head and not strangle me again #&#&# a brand new shirt and he cut it to fit, but yes the rest of the shirt fit fine and was comfortable."
Ethan,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 25, 2022","Feels nice, odd proportions","Bought this in XL, material quality is pretty okay for the price. One thing I’m frustrated about is that with bigger sizes these brands don’t get proportions right. Like around the torso and the arms it’s a little big for my size, which I personally don’t mind and even kinda prefer, the problem is with the cuffs and the neck hole, they’re WAY too small for this size. I can’t comfortably wear my watch, sure they’re elastic but I shouldn’t have to stretch it to it’s limit especially if the the hoodie is MY size. Plus it just looks awkward with the baggy sleeves, it looks like I duct taped a raincoat to my wrists. And I have a bigger than average head, but trying to get my head through the neck hole always is just a little more difficult than it should be. THESE BRANDS NEED TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE CLOTHES FOR BIGGER PEOPLE."
Michael,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 11, 2022","Good value, you get what you pay for","I ordered my regular size a large.Waist wise, I feel it’s a little short. Rides up a lot and doesn’t sit snug on the waist.Material feels a little cheap. I got it just for being around the house on cold days so it does the job. However consider that when buying. Move gotten some hoodies that are target store brand that feel higher quality then this."
Harland J Hart,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 23, 2022",Get what you pay for!,"I wear a 4xl, I bought the 5xl so I could layer. I tried this sweatshirt on and it fit a little snug and is short. Not at all for tall people. After one wash I can tell this sweater won’t fit at all after it shrinks. It is very thin and light weight which is fine, color is nice. That’s what I get for paying only $15 for a sweater. If you’re not tall, might be good for you, just be sure to buy 1 or 2 sizes bigger."
Fashionista,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 18, 2022",Good Quality Hoodie,"This hoodie came in a timely manner. It was a great hoodie. The only thing that was wrong was the color. The picture on the page showed a light silver but it was white with specs. I took a pic with my phone and it showed the same as the pic on the page. It says its a Ash color but its not to me. I always wash before wearing and my grandson did not like the color that is the reason for my 3 rating. I think the people that makes the product, should tell this in their description and let people know its a different color, to let be known it is white with specks. Not the seller's fault. It was what I ordered, but the pic looked like a silver. The strings on the hoodie were white. Some people will like this color but not what I was looking for."
RKO,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 7, 2022","Comfortable, affordable, but not very durable","Pros:Very soft material.  Feels nice.Fits as expected BEFORE first washAffordable (~$14 at time of purchase)Cons:Cotton blend is a bit too light.  It feels thinner than my light ""sweat"" wear from other brands.Hoodie shrinks a bit after every wash.  Feels like too much shrinkage out of a 50/50 blend material.Not very durable.  The stitching around the cuff and one of the sleeve is coming apart.  This is only after 2 months of very light use.Overall, it's an OK hoodie for the price.  Unfortunately, it won't hold up for more than 1 season of use."
Eric Atwell,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 27, 2022",Order A Size Bigger,I ordered a 4XL when it arrived it fit like a 3XL. I'd suggest buying this hoodie one size larger than your normal shirt size. If you want a really good fit. Also the opening for the neck of the hoodie is a bit tight. I had to stretch the opening just a bit so that it didn't feel constricting around my neck. But overall it's an average hoodie. Not very thick.
Kelly KB,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 27, 2022",Belly hangs down below the shirt and no one wants to see that.,"I don't know where they got their measurement from, but it doesn't seem like a truly big and tall person wore it. The 4X sweatshirt fit nicely in the chest and girth part, but the wrist cuffs are too tight, the neck is too tight, and it was too short. No one wants to see belly hanging out below the shirt, and this was before it got washed. The it shrunk."
Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 19, 2022",Very thin but affordable in a pinch,"I've bought the pink hoodie several times in a pinch when I realized I didn't have anything pink in my closet and we were having a dress up day at work. It is quite thin, not the quality I'd expect. This would be suitable for lounging at home but it's not going to keep you any type of warm if the temperature were to dip below 62 or so. It's not particularly soft but not unbearably stiff either. You get what you pay for."
Good Goat Momma,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 15, 2022",My son loves it!,"My son loves the feel of this hoodie and the color was perfect. It has just turned cold here and our area has a wide range from morning to evening. It keeps him warm, but he doesn't get too hot in the warmer part of the day. He asked me to save the link so that he could buy the brand again, has encouraged his sister to get one, and has been using it every day since it arrived. I see I'm going to have to remind him to take a day to wash it.The only negative thing to be said is that the drawstring for the hood has easily been snagged. Maybe the weave was a little too slack. Perhaps he is just a little hard on clothing.Overall, it is a great article of clothing. We will be buying again."
Mark A. Rohrbaugh,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 22, 2022",I got what I was expecting at a good value.  Would recommend.,"Good product.  It was ""value"" priced, so I was not expecting a lot of features or heavy weight materials.  What I got was a good quality, basic safety orange hoodie at a good price.  There were more expensive options, but as I was not buying this to use at work in the field everyday, I didn't need more.It is light weight, so not for serious cold.  It fits well.  I have washed it once and it did not fade or shrink in the one wash.  Pockets are big enough, hood is big enough, hood strings have metal O ring reinforcement."
Kaylan Sallee,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 29, 2022",Great for value but...,"I was looking for a basic hoodie and came across this one on sale. It quickly became a favorite of mine. It fits well and is well made. I'm 5' even and 117lbs ordered a medium; my normal size. If you're looking for a little looser/baggier fit, size up. My only complaint is pilling! Within the first month of wearing it, it pilled around the arms/sides. I don't wear it everyday, but frequently. I was surprised it pilled so fast. Otherwise a great buy."
Edgar Betancourt,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 11, 2022",Head hole small,Nice an comfy just head hole too small ended up cutting part of the neck and sewing the new widen opening to make it work better. I also just have a big head so yeah.
Jennifer ,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 6, 2022",Color in picture is off,"Was looking for a sweat pant & hoodie set in the same color for a gift.

Big Guy,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 6, 2022",Soft and light weight. Perfect everyday hoodie.,I am 6'3 320 and I ordered a 3x. It fits well and it's not tight at all. Sleeves are not short and it doesn't show my belly button when I raise my arms at the gym. Light weight and thin. Perfect everyday Hoodie.
Amazon Customer,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022",pretty good hoodie,I accidentally bought the wrong size but it fits pretty good. its not as fleece lined as I thought it was but overall still comfortable
Donna Hopkins,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 8, 2022",Wish it was a bit longer,"Love the yellow color, It fits well for the moment, but concerned about shrinkage when I wash it for the first time.  I wish it was a couple of inches longer."
Amazon Customer,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 13, 2022",Fits and looks good,Great for how cheap it is ! It loses its softness as you wash it but still looks great and would recommend for cheap hoodie
Jilina Ford,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 8, 2022",fairly thin fabric,"For it’s price, it’s a great deal but I wasn’t expecting it to be such thin material. Size wise, it was a good fit but I expected it to be a bit bigger. I’m usually a size small and ordered a medium to get a more of a loose fit. The draw string was very cheaply made along with the material used on the waist and cuffs. These are just minor issues I saw but it really is a decent sweater especially for it’s price."
CALI DECARO,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 6, 2022",Obsessed - our favorite hoodies hands down!,My 13 yo & I love these! She is around 5’ & 75lbs and likes these to be oversized so she wears a large (she also has a medium and that fits very well too.) I’m 5’4” 160lb and wear a large if I want it to fit “properly” and an XL if I want it oversized and long enough to cover my butt in leggings. Even when oversized they don’t look like a moo-moo and still look really nice. The overall material is lightweight while the inside is warm enough but not too warm (not going to make you sweat indoors.) They don’t seem to shrink when dried and hold up well over multiple washes. We have at least 7 of them and will keep buying them!
Jordin,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 23, 2022","Great quality, excellent price!","Exactly what you're looking for if you want that ""boyfriend hoodie"" which is what ai was shopping for. Women's hoodies are overpriced and always have a strange fit for me, I end up wearing guys hoodies anyways so I figured I'd cut to the chase. It is warm and cozy. I bought it to be something I can wear while working with dogs. It keeps me warm, hasn't really gotten dirty except the occasional dog jumping on me and its easy to wash. I am actually wearing it now! I pretty much wear it underneath my winter coats when outside in the cold and it adds that extra comfortable layer of warmth! I'll likely get more in other colors but grey was perfect as its my ""on-the-job"" sweater."
Susan Miller,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022",Comfortable and Pretty,"After wearing my husbands pullover for over two weeks, I decided to get one of my own.  Since I was used to an oversized fit I ordered a large in mens instead of a medium.  The hardest part was choosing a color.  I ordered the  light blue one.  The Color matches the advertised picture perfectly ( which as you know hardly ever happens ) we have fluctuating weather in Memphis so this can be worn year round.  It is so comfortable and soft, I think I need to order another one."
Amazon Customer,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 11, 2022",Ladies! This is it!,"I always buy men's hoodies because I hate that women's hoodies are so constricting. I recently gained LOTS of weight (140-185lbs) and as a 5'5"" female, that's a lot. I bought a black, white & blue one cause these don't make it look like I'm hiding something and cover up what I want them too. Light enough for 70° but warm enough for 40° They cover my a@@ but don't look like I'm wearing a dress. They go perfect with all my leggings and jeans."
Lily Egg,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 2, 2022",So soft!,"I thought this was going to be just a standard sweatshirt with no extra cloth on the interior, or cheaply made. However, when I got it I was surprised by how soft the inside was! I’m sure it will pill if washed and dried a couple times, but I washed it once and it’s still super soft (although I did air dry). The quality of the fabric is very good, it fits well and has no seen or felt imperfections, and the color is exactly like the picture! 10/10 Hoodie!"
Sheena,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022",Fitting,"This is a nice, basic sweatshirt! I needed it for work. The wrists and lower arms are a little tight, but they stay in place. Bottom is also fitting which is nice compared to the Hanes zip-up which is more loose and less fitted on the bottom. Washed before wearing and the inside is still super soft. On the light weight side but still super warm. Good for layering"
Karen A. Sturtevant,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",This Sweatshirt is 1 of the most liked products purchased on Amazon-having bought one I can see why!,Shipping was quick and I bought a size larger than I expected to need in case there is any shrinkage while washing and because some reviews said they run a bit smaller than the size says. Absolutely love the soft material and comfort of this Sweatshirt! It's not too heavy to make me hot if I'm doing errands but not so light that you get cold either.
Ray ,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022",Fantastic,"I’ve bought two of these hoodies for the chilly weather and they are fantastic. The fleece is warm, but not too thick. Regular fit, so fits exactly as expected. Not too small, nor too big. It even has that new clothes smell lol I really like it can’t believe I found these. One thing I recommend is taking it to the cleaners rather than washing. So the material doesn’t get ruined with washes"
nateinMN,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022",way better than expected,it's so comfy and warm I wear it everyday after work. I'm in Minnesota burr.the inside is like a cozy soft blanket. it's lightweight and fits great!going to order more asap!  not sure how it will hold up long term but at the price I'll accept a season haha.
Crunchy,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 11, 2022",Perfect for cosplay,"I bought this for a casual Raphael cosplay, I am a dumdum and forgot that these were in Men’s sizing so although it is a little big on me, it’s a good oversized feel.

Amazon Customer,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 3, 2022",These socks will not work well with a size 13 foot. The design is flawed,"The sock does not have Enough material to hug the top of your ankles. After a few steps of walking, the sock gets sucked down into your shoe. Try socks that have material closer to the top of your ankles."
Amazon Customer,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 30, 2022",Refuse to stay up,These socks are considered “no show” because they’ll be bunched up in the bottom of your shoe in a wad. Can’t believe they get a 4+ rating. The rating must be for all Under Armour socks. This type is terrible.

Previous purchase was good quality, comfortable, and durable. These are very thin, nylon feeling material with poorly done seams that rub. The socks also run small. When the description says no shoe, it really means only covers part of your foot so your shoes will rub directly on your skin while exercising. This may not be real UA or UA quality has gone way down."
Robert Koors,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 25, 2022",Socks lack durability,"I’ve really liked under armour socks 5/6 years ago but as of late it’s become apparent they are prioritizing profits over quality.I still have the under armour ankle socks from 5 years ago that to this day do not have holes (but feel older as they’ve been through the laundry 100s of times). These new socks are only 1 year old and are already developing holes. They’ve probably only been washed 30/40 times.If you value a good quality sock, under armour unfortunately no longer is a competitor in the quality sock market and I’ll be bringing my own businesss elsewhere."

I have being training for a half marathon this coming January, which I will mostly walk.I wear these no show as well as low cut performance tech with my Ultraboost 21s in all that time (5 times a week). I have 9 pairs total. They are spongier on the bottom than the top. With most running shoes, there will be about 1/2"" sticking up.They come in various colors. They are great value for money in sixes.At this time they are my only running socks, so I highly recommend."

Bert S.,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022",Poor stitching quality control,Champion apparently doesn't have any quality controls in place because 3 of the 4 corners of the pouch pocket had stitching that was coming out. There was also stitching coming out on the seams attaching one of the sleeves to the body but that one might have been able to just be trimmed along with many other threads that weren't properly trimmed by the manufacturer.I am returning the sweatshirt because I don't want to risk the pocket ripping off after a little wear or washing.The sweatshirt was also a lot thinner and lightweight than I was expecting it to be.

Kevin,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 29, 2022",Long arms!,"So first off, it’s a great overall hoodie. Especially at the cyber deals going on now. I got my black one for $20! Ok. Do I bought the grey one first. The left arm does not line up seams from the arm to the cuff. It wouldn’t be noticeable if it didn’t turn the “C” logo on the arm and make it face towards my torso. Other than that I love it. Soft and very form fitting. I do wish the cuff at the bottom was tighter but that’s champions thing. Longer in the front than the back slightly and the back not “gripping” you. That being said, I’m incredibly ocd/adhd. It’s not a big deal at all.the black one I just got seems flawless…. So far. One other thing to add to the grey..I noticed it is piling up on the kangaroo pocket and other places that get a lot of attention. I have an electric pill cutter so nbd unless it continues. I didn’t notice it till after the first wash and literally just after placing the order for the black. These are identical to the much thicker black one I have.Bottom line: It’s a good buy at the discounted cyber/Black Fridayprices. Idk that I would pay regular price for them. Actually I do know. I wouldn’t. Not thick enough for reg price. I use them to go with my joggers I workout in. They look great with joggers. Idk if they’re long enough to wear with jeans. My thick black one isn’t either.Hope this helps!"
Kindle Customer,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 3, 2022",Shipped in flimsy clear plastic bag that was ripped on delivery!,"The sweatshirt is fine, no problems.  The issue is the packaging, or no packaging at all.  The bag it was shipped in was thin see through plastic, like what a garment is in before it is placed in another bag.  Bag had hole in it and some cuts.  Many of my orders are arriving in plastic see through bags, not as thin as this, but still see through.

The Outdoor Nerd,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 14, 2022",So warm and comfy!,"Normally I'm not a big fan of pullover hoodies. I like to keep a couple and they were a good price on Prime Day, so I ordered red and black ones. And I was blown away. The colors and style are fantastic. The lining of the hood and metal-tipped draw string pulls are nice touches.The powerblend fleece is the main reason I got them since the sweat pants have become my favorites. I don't know if it's pre-washed but they don't seem to shrink. It's much softer and more comfortable than pure polyester.Normally I can find something I don't like about any product, but these might honestly be perfect. I'm not usually a big fan of big logos, but the Champion logo is very well done.  They deserve to have their logo in big letters if they're going to make a hoodie this good.I've since bought a royal blue pullover and now a black reverse weave, full zip hoodie. It seems like so many brands have been getting worse lately but Champion is just nailing it. These pullovers are so warm it's the first thing I reach for when I'm cold. I think the hood lining is cotton? It's soft."

It did shrink about an inch all the way around, (which I didn't care bcuz I ordered a size up just incase that would happen), but THERE'S MULTIPLE HOLES AFTER ONE WASHING!

There was a tiny hole after the first wash.A couple weeks later, it was washed again and there were more holes.  A few weeks later, after another wash and if you look at the photo.  There are several small holes and one huge hole.Unfortunately, I didn't read the return policy.  Which limits the time to 30 days.  I went over that amount by 10 days.  I have never seen a T-shirt deteriorate so fast.  Now, I have to use it as a rag.  Don't be attracted to this product by the price. It's definitely not worth 2 cents.  I've never given one star before and I hope I never have to again. Buyer beware."
ET,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 2, 2022",DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This product was a huge disappointment. It stretches oddly out of shape if you just look at it, or so it seemed to me.  I don't know if it stretched, or shrunk, or what. I only know it did whatever it did asymmetrically it stretched and shrank in every direction it was a tee shirt found in through the looking Glass. If you want a decent tee shirt, get Kirkland. The only reason I got these was because I couldn't find Kirkland. I thought Costco discontinued them. Thank goodness I was wrong. Kirkland tee shirts are as good as JC Penny's was back in the 70s.And I've had good Gildans. These just weren't those.They might make good polishing rags, however."

Roland,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 19, 2022",Size was small for me,"Contrary to many reviewers, these shirts ran small in my XLG normal size.  They were described as being light weight which they were in the extreme.  I weighed one of these shirts and compared it to a tee that I bought from Foot Locker a few years ago - 169 grams verses 320 grams Foot Locker shirt.  I use tee shirts for gardening and home improvement projects; for my purposes these tees are much too light and probably not durable enough."

John Trace,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 18, 2022",Do not buy these,"I bought a 5 pack of these.  I wore and washed them all one time.  Every one of them has small holes in the bottom front of shirt.  I read about this problem and learned it's can be caused by the use of cheap, 3rd cut cotton from china along with the shirt rubbing on fabric like jeans when wearing.  DO NOT BUY.  You will be wasting your money."
Mike S,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 2, 2022",They shrink soooo much,"I bought these shirts in XXL. I typically wear gildan shirts because I like the way that their 2X  fits. For reference I’m 6’ and 285lbs, stocky athletic build, I’m not all belly. They fit great before I washed them, maybe slightly baggy but once washed they shrunk so much they’re unwearable. I usually buy a different style gildan shirt and after washing they fit great but I’d guess these shrunk down to smaller than a XL and they lost probably 3-4” in length. They’re comically short after washing. I do like how the sleeves are a little bit smaller than most gildan shirts for a more trim look than a baggy look.  The material itself is very thin and light weight which I like while I’m working out. If they didn’t shrink beyond wearable size they’d be great."
Brian M.,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022",Stretched and shrank,6 foot 4.Had high hopes when first put on. But after wearing it the neck stretches and the sleeves stretch.

dvd,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 6, 2022",too sheer for my taste,"I usually like to buy t-shirts from a store - where I can actually 'touch and feel' and to see if it is 'too transparent', but I was shopping online and needed some t-shirts.  So, for convenience, I ordered these, since the reviews seemed to indicate they were pretty good and the material content is almost identical to what I usually buy.  I am a female - but prefer to buy men's t-shirts for casual wear; I always found them to be more comfortable than t-shirts made for women. I also found that men's t's are usually made much more durable than those made for women - and last for years.  However, when these came in I was disappointed to see how thin the material felt and how sheer they were.  Sheerer than any men's t-shirt that I have ever seen.  I also found the shape quite different - compared to most men's t-shirts that I own.  I am guessing, however, the thinness may be great for someone wanting to keep cool - so I gave it two stars for that."
Top Contributor: Pets,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 22, 2022",Does not hold up,I do not wear them very often and after having 1 year ( wearing one every couple of weeks) they have become yard work under shorts. Shirts are thin and do not hold up very well. The neck rim is thin.  Would no buy again.  Went back to Costco brand.
Dana Griffin,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 22, 2022",I miss the days…,"I missed the days when companies like Gildan made quality products. I would rather pay extra for an item and have the same quality it used to have. This doesn’t appear to be an option anymore. There are so many new companies that come out making items like this, you never know who to trust so your knee-jerk reaction is to go with the name you recognize as quality. Unfortunately that quality no longer exists. I’ve had two out of the six T-shirts have the stitching fray and come out of the collar area. I’m 59 years old and don’t do heavy “construction“ work around my home so it’s always just light yardwork and these T-shirts can’t hold up to that. And when they come out of the dryer, the collar is all wonky because of the black band that’s sewn in there to give the collar structure, doesn’t expand or contract at the same rate the cotton around it does."
MadMaxx,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022",Terrible GMO material,"Like everything else nowadays, these shirts are made with synthetic material (man made gmo cotton). Not organic cotton. It’s characteristics are terrible. Won’t be buying again."
Eighty Five,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 30, 2022",Sleeves are unproportional and shirts all fit differently.,All of the shirts seem to fit a little bit different. They're all just slightly different sizes. Some of them shoulders were a little narrower somewhere a little wider. Some of the sleeves are a little longer. Some little shorter biggest issue is the sleeve section between the armpit and under bicep is about a 15th of an inch long. So you end up with a shoulder cap and then if you're a bigger size the shirt will go down to your knees. So length is as expected but sleeves are jacked up and there is no consistency. Might as well buy clothes from the flea market.
Zach Wadsworth,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 29, 2022",Smaller,I love the fabric. The comfort would have been good if they fit right. I have a Gildan vneck that's a medium and it fits perfect but these feel like an extra layer of skin. Ordered a large in a different shirt of Gildan brand so I'll see how those fit afterwards.
ERIC LATHAM,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 20, 2022",They shrink fast after two washes,They were perfect when I first got them. I use them for work but they fade fast and shrink fast after three washes. They shrink and quality not good no more.
Rudy rodriguez,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 25, 2022",Material is off,"I purchased a few packs of these shirts some time ago.I have a serious over heating problem with these shirts. I purchase 100% cotton because they breath. One thing I noticed is the when the label says made in Honduras, I dont sweat in those shirts but shirts made in Bangladesh, I'm soaked within 1 hour.I served in the US Military for 20 years. I had to wear the Tan and brown T-shirts for all that time. The brown shirts were made of cotton and breathed. The new tan shirts were 50/50 and I then that's when I started dripping with sweat.I can tell the shirts for Bangladesh are not 100% cotton. The Cotton T-shirt from Honduras are 100% cotton."

MAUI,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 11, 2022",tshirts are just ok,"Gildan must have different qualitys of tshirt, the others I have gotten have always been thick and don't shrink too much, these particular T's I guess are for bulk sales, or resellers, the material is thinner than I was expecting, and they shrink, these XL's fit me snug, and I hate snug tshirts, if you like thin, snug fitting tshirts, then these are for you, if you prefer them thick and roomy, look elsewhere or get a size bigger than your normal size"
Sid Hubbs,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 8, 2022",Not heavyweight cotton by any stretch of the imagination,"I searched for heavyweight cotton tshirts, and these were among the top results so I ordered up a pack.  Let me tell you, these are not heavyweight cotton by anyone's definition.  Sure, they're (slightly) heavier than their Fruit of the Loom counterparts, but they still don't even approach ""heavyweight"".  I waited too long to return them and I'm stuck with them now."
Marcus Borealis,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",Should be labled Big and Tall,Ordered Large like I normally do and these are easily 2XL. I will keep them since I use them in the winter to sleep in. Someone must have mislabeled them at the factory. They are supposedly 100% cotton so I hope they shrink some.
UG,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 27, 2022",Not the same quality,"I purchased these shirts two years ago and decided the buy them again. I gave three stars because the quality has gone down. While they still fit as expected, they are paper-thin compared to the previous ones. Despite being washed many times over the past two years, the old shirts are still thicker than the one I received today. I'm sure these won't last long. Way to save cotton, Gildan! Not cool and not recommended."
Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 16, 2022",Honest review from someone that is not getting paid or any other incentive to write this review.,So unless i got a bad batch (which can happen so take that in stride) they seem to only be okay quality.  Out of the pack that i bought currently there are 3 that seem to be coming apart.  I wear white undershirts 5 days out of the week so they do get used and i am pretty active with them but these just did not seem to last.  The price is good and are comfortable although slightly shorter than i like i still would recommend them especially if the price stays low.
Vicky,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 8, 2022",Fits nice but neck too small,"The fit and design of the t shirt is great except the neck is too small and is usually peeking over most t shirtsQuality and color seems okay, feels soft, haven’t washed a lot so don’t know about shrinkage"
Ariella,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 13, 2022",Clothes,Theses shrits are 10/10 when it comes to to the softness and warmth but because they are all cotton they shrank when they where put in the dryer
Kyle S. Church,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 30, 2022","Comfy, but sometimes defective.","ORIGINAL REVIEW (2 STARS): I bought a pack of these because you really can't beat the price. I had been buying Hanes Beefy Tees, but at 9-12 bucks per shirt, I was ready to pinch some pennies. I just needed some cheap tee shirts, and something on the thinner side wouldn't hurt either.These are the thin, lightweight material I was hoping for, and still quite soft. The one I tried on straight from the package fit me nicely, though it was a little longer than I'd like. I expect they'll shrink in the wash, which would be ok as the fit was just slightly loose.However, there was a hole in the front of the shirt! I didn't look at the other 4 from the package, I just packed them up for exchange. Hopefully the second go 'round yields better results. I'll update/add to my review as necessary.UPDATED REVIEW (3 1/2 STARS): The replacement pack of shirts arrived and none of them have holes! They shrunk in the wash a bit, but still fit well enough. Still a good deal if you're just looking for cheap plain tees!"
Chris,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 5, 2022",Fits well but shrink,Fits well but has shrink through many dry and wash cycles. Order size up or don't use too much heat when drying.
Sparty,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 30, 2022",Shrinkage,"The shirt fits well and the size is as described. The only issue is that the shirts shrink if washed in cold water. My large shirts have gone to almost belly button shirts, so they get cutup and become shop rags. I would not buy this product again only because of the shrinking factor. I like to throw all my clothes in the wash and then the dryer. I do not want to sit there, and sort through each individual piece of clothing to determine how I need to wash it and dry it."
Tiff ,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 17, 2022",Perfect Basic T-shirt,"Bought the Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts, Multipack, Style G1100 in size Medium and was pleasantly surprised with the product. When reading reviews I found it helpful when others provided actual weight and height.  The product was bought for a slender teen about 116 pounds and 5ft 8in. The M worked perfect for the way he likes clothing to fit. We followed the washing instructions and have washed them twice and dried in the dryer on the air dry cycle for delicate clothing. They held their shape and color. The lighting is terrible in the pictures so it doesn’t do the shirt justice. Super soft, very comfortable, tag-less is a plus, and length is phenomenal. They are thin but these colors were only see through if you held them up to a light source. My teen does not like the fitted look so we bought the medium. If you are looking for a well fitted shirt get your actual size based off the size guide. Based off these last comments, the item did not get a 5 star review.  This is picking at straws to get a well thought out review and it really is all about preferences. Perfect for layering and warm weather. Really can’t beat the price for the quality."
Amazon Customer,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 5, 2022",Better than most but still not the best,"I was looking for different colored quality t-shirts.  I’ve bought black t’s and white t’s from Kirkland for the past 15 odd years and was looking for something of the same quality but a variety in colors.  These do not stand up to the Kirkland shirts, but are better than anything else I’ve found.  The thickness, length, and the fact it wrinkles pretty easy are the qualities that do not match the ones I mentioned above."
K. Post,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022",Sport grey color was the perfect fit,"The black and dark grey was kinda like a fitted xl. The sport grey has a little more room, lot longer, and feels softer. If I could just buy all sport grey I would"
~Brooke~,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 13, 2022",Larger than normal,These are great quality but I do find that they are larger than normal and fit very baggy on my husband. I do like them but wish they were a little more true to size.
Kevin S. Morris,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 30, 2022",Will shrink over time. Huge fan of these shirts,"Jockey, Gildan so far are the brands that take up my shirt drawer. The feel good, the fit good, they get the job done!they will shrink over time or if you wash them in hot alot"

BenK,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 11, 2022",Value for the money,"Initially purchased as undershirts, but used them as regular outing t-shirts. They fit well, and do not shrink heavily in wash. I would say though, if you like a looser fit, get these a size bigger…? They don’t shrink real bad, but if you get an x-large and really should have been in an xx-large, you won’t survive it. The washing."

Deedee c,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",Very satisfied & would recommend,"Male35 y.o  6'4, & 170 lbs, thin muscular build. ordered 6 pk gilad, white shirts for $18 ish and it fits perfect good material would recommend. He says he wished the arm length were a little longer.( But i think it looks good ) Also, i have not washed them yet so idk how much they will shrink or not. If when i do wash and dry they shrink alot, then i will update this review. If i dont update this review then they did not shrink to much. Length is perfect a little below belt , fit at chest and waist is perfect. But with that being said he is very tall and sometimes need to buy from big and tall section. But i dont think this falls in that category. I think anyone 5'9 or taller length would fit really good. My 17 y.o son is 5'9 and 140 lbs and still has growing to do as he is more on the skinny side, needs a size small. Would recommend and would buy again. Very satisfied with this purchase"
chris,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022",Good,I had low expectations as cause every t shirt seems to just suck but this one fit exactly as I hoped it would. That being said I washed them then dried them on low heat ( I do this with all cheap t shirts anyway as they seem to always have a weird long fit out of the box ) They are high up the arm and fit tightly around the chest an waist but not to tight to where they are uncomfortable. For reference I’m lean but with slightly broader shoulders and I’d say “athletic arms”I’ll update this review in a month or so if the shirts randomly become unwearable which happens to be the theme with cheap clothing but as of right now these are going to be my go to “ plain shirts “ if nothing changes. Hope this helped
D. G.,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022","Great, cheap T's","These are my favorite cheap T's. The material is on the thinner side but they are very soft.I can wear either medium or large.  The Medium are close to a ""perfect"" fit and the large are a little more of a relaxed fit but still fit me well.  I'm about 5'9"" and the length is great on both M and L sizes.  For the price I have nothing negative to say about these T's.  I just wish that they were available individually (or as pairs) with all those color options that are offered for the Gildan Heavy and Gildan Ultra Cotton T's."
Diego Cafe,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022","Good quality, good fit","I wear these shirts under my uniform so I like them snug but not as constricting as underarmour which tends to stink if worn as an undershirt for too long. I am 6'3"", 200 lbs with an athletic build and medium fits me perfectly. It comes below my waist. The material did not shrink after being washed and dried. These are what I needed. I lucked out and got them as a black Friday deal so I'm happy. I recommend if you need a quality t-shirt."
Karson Clark,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 11, 2022",Good quality shirts,"I just needed some plain t shirts for work since I don’t want to ruin anything nice. Ordered these and they are great. Only bad thing is that they do shrink if you put them in a dryer so I recommend either not tumble drying them or just order a size bigger. Overall solid shirts that hold up and are very comfortable to wear, I highly recommend these shirts."
Himself,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 6, 2022",Good for the price!,"The shirts seem to be made well enough.  No poorly stiched seams found.  Comfortable when worn alone or under another shirt.  Maybe not as soft as other t-shirts, but aren't scratchy.  They feel a little thin, but not cheap.  Almost tough.  I wear size L and ordered my size.  They're good.  I only wish I could've bought a set with all different colors."
Mark,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 21, 2022",The only form fitting (sport fit) tees out there?,"It seems like ""sport fit"" t-shirts don't seem to exist anymore, outside of those specialty brands that charge $50 for a pack of 3. After a lot of trying/returning, I finally came across these. They are true 'form-fitting' around your arms - no gaps or 'wing tips' on the side - and are the closest thing I've found to that ""triangular"" fit that is a normal width at the shoulders and tapers more inward toward the waist. The material is far more cool than the standard Gildan DryBlend 100% cotton tees (these are a 50/50 Cotton & Polyester blend), and ideal for the gym or sports as you don't feel so overheated. I really love how these fit and look, and you can't beat the price."
Michael Thomas,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022",GREAT,I canceled at first. I tried it on again to compare this to my current t-shirts. It feels and fits great. I will keep this order and order another set for the woman I am dating. She is a lot shorter than I am but she likes to wear my clothes.d My t-s; shirts will not disappear as fast.
Amazon Customer,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 29, 2022",Great t for me,I love the way these t's fit me. I have bought fruit of the loom and hanes recently both are too long and the necks too wide. They make my body look weird. I work out alot and have a muscular frame. These t's from Gildan fit me perfect. They are the perfect length and neck size . And are form fitting I get alot of compliments when I wear these shirts.
MatrixRage,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 27, 2022",Good length,"These shirts have a great length. They are long enough that they don't ride up. Been trying to loss weight, and got down to large. When you are at that border area, shirts can feel a little short and ride up when you kneel/bend/squat. These are perfect for me. Additionally the material is softer than many shirts you buy in a pack like this. Easily my favorite pack shirts I've found to date."
Drew Neininger,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 14, 2022",Not Durable,"Jackets comfortable and warm.

It is about 1/4 inch short fur at best.. It also is a very thin shirt there is no way they should be classified as a shirt jacket... Please believe me I just received this shirt last night and these facts are correct I sent it back immediately the manufacturer needs to take a good look at this shirt jacket as they call it and change the description. This shirt should cost about $20.99 best that's all it is worth trust me.

When spending this much money I expect it to be great quality.  When I looked at exchanging it, the process is NOT convenient at all.  So, I either accept this defective product or I go through a LOT of effort to exchange it. The time, money, and effort involved are not worth it.  I have zero tolerance for expensive items that are not good quality.  I won't be purchasing any other items from this line."

CJ,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 7, 2021",Persistent Defects on an otherwise great product,"This coat is a perfect layering or spring fall coat. It is soft, gorgeous, and has a great fit. However, on opening it on Christmas, my boyfriend discovered the entire side seam undone. This was not repairable due to the lining. So we initiated a return. The replacement we received had unfinished seams, super long, untied threads hanging off it. I wouldn't be surprised if it came undone as well. I could not initiate a third return and my boyfriend loved the item. So I'm forced to take it to a tailor to see if the threads can be fixed. It seems like a great quality item but the finishing is terrible. This is really upsetting. I would love to get one that is good, but frankly I'm tired of returning it and I don't know if Amazon would let me get a refund the third time. I have seen other comments like this and I think the manufacturer really needs to check what is going on."

But stitching already coming undone and already lost a button.. haven't even had it a year.  This brand is supposed to be durable and I'm disappointed. However because it looks good and is warm he still wears it... I just didn't buy it with intentions to sew it regularly... not convinced this is real branded."
wlthlla,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 10, 2020",Hold up!,"The shirt caught my eye because the description said “Berber lined”. I also liked the patch on the sleeves.  My son has out-grown the one I purchased from our local big box store and this one looked like a good replacement.  Much to my surprise, comparing the weight of the two jackets is vastly different. Second, this coat is NOT lined with Berber, but some smooth long haired “fur” that looks pretty but makes the shirt tight to wear his proper size (if you have any muscle depth). Third, the outside material feels very thin as if it would not hold up any time under constant wear. If he didn’t have the one from the local store to compare I wouldn’t know any different but would have wasted money. Lastly the price price point ($80) for this shirt exceeds the quality.  I was disappointed twice. This coat is not made for the rugged, rough and tough guy."
blacksheep0105,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 10, 2022",Great Until It Was Washed,"After it's first wash, this shrank and shriveled.

The reviews on this were good regarding comfort & warmth but...being 100% cotton, you CANNOT put in dryer! The reviews state that this jacket will shrink! Therefore, I purchased one size larger...I still won’t be able to dry in the dryer! I’ll have to hang dry! For that reason only, I gave it 4🌟! My main reason fer purchasing this particular hooded jacket is fer the snaps! I really like the snaps! Much easier to snap than to zip...? It looks GR8 & I’ve worn it already & it is absolutely warm! I absolutely love Legendary Whitetails!They have the best flannels & jackets! I have two (2) jackets and a slew of flannels! Which I also hang dry after three (3) minutes in the dryer...I can always iron my flannels but not my jacket! Anywho...just make sure you read the small print & ALL REVIEWS, maybe order a size bigger...if you wanna dry them! Thanks again fer reading my review Merica’!  God bless y’all & as a friend always says:America, Bless God again!Well, I’ve an update regarding the “snaps!” I should’ve included with my prior review! The jacket fits really well, but I hadn’t snapped it up completely & fer that I apologize to anyone who’d read my review! Anywho, two of the six snaps @ the bottom didn’t line up correctly & I thought it’d be ok! It really wasn’t a big deal but I’ma bit OCD!!!So, I started a return specifically stating my issue. Ordered a replacement & received the new one today (03/18/21) I’m glad that I did because my replacement jacket is perfect! The snaps line up like they’re supposed to! I really like my new jacket! It’s gonna be perfect to work in the yard, stand around the bonfire or a quick middle of the night grab when TiggR needs to go potty...🤪So glad I replaced the first one! Because of this updated review, I’m also updating my 4 stars to 5🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 even tho I won’t be able to fully dry it! Most of the time I wash, then hang dry anyways.Legendary Whitetails has been & still is one of my all time favs fer warmth! Thanks fer reading my updated review & I hope it helps everyone whom might be interested in this brand!***updated review***While I gave this jacket a glowing review, I’ve now found it to be lacking in quality of the snaps! First one I purchased, the snaps didn’t line up correctly so I just figured it was a one time blemish:(I returned & received an replacement and I really liked! Warm {Extremely} very fashionable and the snaps lined up perfectly! Got a bit chilly the other day as I went out on the patio to have my covfefe… & watch the sunrise! Came back in fer a refill and what do ya kno, dang snap is BUSTED!!! Ripped right through the material🤬🤬🤬So, I’m done with Legendary Whitetails jackets that include snaps! I’ve only worn this jacket a handful of times taken really good care of and I’m thoroughly disappointed! Anyways…I hope that this helps! I’ve included four pics to show everyone."
James,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 19, 2022",Poor fit and proportions,"Very snug around the torso and doesn't leave much room for layering. The cuffs at the wrists are also very tight and the sleeves like to ride up my arm. After only a few washes, the lining has begun to bunch up on the inside and there are few loose threads along some seams. Not what I was expecting at this price point."
Jared B,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 11, 2022",I like the design but the fit doesn’t work for shorter folks,"I wanted to love this. I’m 5’6”, 150lbs with larger shoulder and the small does not fit anywhere close to right. It is too long and too skinny. If you were 5’9” @ 150lbs you’d probably be OK. I tried a medium and a small and neither fits right. Unfortunate because it’s a good looking jacket. A bit overpriced but good looking."
YouBETTERrun!,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 1, 2022",Way bigger than it looked,"I bought this hoodie when it was on sale to have something to wear to the dog park in the Fall. Overall, I would describe it as average. It is comfy to wear but the dimensions are off for me at 5""8"", athletic build. I bought the small and it is much longer than expected and the sleeves border on baggy. Definitely cut for the chunkier monkeys out there."
Dora hunsaker,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 25, 2022",It is what it said it is,It is nice but I was disappointed in  the warmth of the  flannel  the size is great but it is not  as warm  you need to wear a hoodie  or terminal  shirt  with it. I don't think it was a 72. 00 jacket it's more like a 25.00 jacket  you can buy a coat for 72.00 not happy  for  the price l got 3 of these  for 38.70  foe the one color  but if it's  under 65 temperature  you're  not  going to be warm

Angela,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 25, 2021",Thin,"The jacket is alot thinner than I expected. Definitely won't keep you warm for the winter. I was a bit sad, I was planning to wear this to go fishing in low 50 degree weather but it seems I will need to wear 4 layers under it. the quilted part is nice but it's only in the sleeves, the chest is made of flannel with a fluffy layered sewn to it with no cotton of filling in between for warmth. I like the jacket is seems well made besides it being really thin, I just expected a hefty and warm jacket for $70, also mine had a big made in China tag on it which I don't mind but then I feel it should be priced a bit cheaper since china factories charge cheaper for their labor, so why am I paying American labor price?"
D.L.,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 22, 2022","Decent design, but expensive","While the fabrics are just about average, there are a few design details that make it stand out a bit on the fashion side. The wavy very shirt like lower line, snaps design, the leatherette elbow patches, 3piece hood with high extra snap for neck protection, these are very small and not apparent but play together well. 45 degree plaid pattern on front pockets and hood contrast. Impeccable size and placement for the side pockets, which is surprisingly rare in this type of jackets.It is not a work jacket by any means, definitely not sturdy enough, nowhere close to duck cotton jackets in that department. The outer shell probably rips rather easily, given a chance.The flannel is rather typical, although I got a feeling it is slightly softer and more pilling than usual. There is already some pilling, and there probably will be more, but nothing pill remover won't fix if it comes to that. Also, as typical for these materials, wrinkles quite easily, perhaps some gentle ironing could help.The cuffs are fitted slim, if you have large hands, chances are you may have to undo them when putting on. But it works for me, less wind in the sleeves.This jacket is rather light and is somewhere in the middle, between single layer fleece hoodie, and sherpa lined duck cotton jackets like Dickies, in terms of warmth. Perhaps mid 50s with a moderate wind at most. I don't hold it against it, it's just the weather it is for.Price is definitely a downside. Yes design has a lot of attention, but material and quality wise I don't see justification vs. the others.If you are lucky and get a copy without manufacturing defects, I'd say it's a good buy just on the style metits, assuming price is not objectionable."
AnikaGSD,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022",Wonderful Jacket (some assembly required.....),"The jacket shrinks a full size after a heavy duty wash and dry cycle.  I factored that in when sizing, so now I have a great fitting XL from my XXL purchase.  I love how the pockets are low in the jacket - they make comfortable hand warmers.  The jacket is also longer than my previous shirt/jackets - it fits more like a parka.Snaps are a DIY affair since the factory installed snaps quickly fall off.  You need to purchase a $15 snap repair kit and redo those.  Minus one point for that."
Patrick Williams,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 24, 2022","Great jacket, but problems with the details","Pretty solid jacket. Ordered the XL and it was a little big (I am 6'1"", 190lbs) but it shrank in the wash to a perfect size. Very comfortable and warm, but 2 of the buttons fell off during the 1st week wearing it. The buttons are snaps, and pulling the buttons a part is what caused them to fall off so it's either a design flaw or the buttons aren't secured enough when manufactured. Other than that I'm happy with the purchase"

But I'm a 6'0 male/190 pounds and semi-muscular -- a fits perfectly!The only reason it didn't get a 5 star is b/c the fluffy berber doesn't continue through the arms...just around the torso. Add the berber through out and it's a 5-star.THAT said, it's a fine shirt/jacket. I'm sure the arms are still warm. Good buy!"
Tracy,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 7, 2022",My son loves it!,I bought this for my 15 year old son and he loves it fits perfectly. We haven’t had to wash it yet hopefully it doesn’t shrinkUpdate: A button fell off in less than a week! For $75 I wouldn’t expect this!
Denis McAllister,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 31, 2022",Didn't last 2 weeks before lining ripped away from shell.,Wish it would have been better quality.
Connie S,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 22, 2022",Great Quality,I loved the jacket. Appears to be nicely made. The material is comfortable.  The only problem is the sizing. It's cut a little small for an xxl so I had to return the jacket.  May buy another because I really liked it
Wendy Bud,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 1, 2022",Favorite gift,"I gave this jacket in a medium to my son-in-law. He is a rather small man, 5'9"" and 150 lbs, so he usually wears a medium. Overall, this jacket is nice looking, durable, and fits. However, when he buttons the bottom button, the jacket is actually a little too tight there. I think a small would be too small for him, but if he even gained a few pounds, I don't think he would be able to button the bottom button. I guess the jacket just needs a little more room."
Library Lil,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 11, 2022",Warm and cozy.,Bought this for my adult son. Very thick and still comfortable. Quilted inside sleeves and fleece lining for front and back. Double sweatshirt fabric for hood. Very cozy. He enjoys it and wears in in lieu of a jacket. Buy one size larger and layer up for extra warmth. He wears a M and a L was perfect for layering with shirt and sweater or even another hoodie. Good looking plaid. Cardinal is sort of a rust color.
Been There,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 25, 2022",It Works for Me,"I'm a big guy.  6' 2"" tall, 270 pounds, 18"" neck, 50"" chest, and 38"" waist.  My ideal shirt/jacket size would be 1-1/2XL Tall - nobody makes that size.  So, I have to find XL-Talls that are cut a little loose or XXL-Talls that are cut a little tight, and even that's difficult because I'm long waisted.  Just finding tall sizes at all is exasperating.  So, for this hoodie I ordered XXL-Tall (yes, they had it - woo hoo) based upon at least one previous review that the cut was a little small.  Happily, this hoodie is a perfect fit FOR ME.  If you have similar requirements and are fat, then you may have a problem.  With this fall/winter hoodie, you should be able to comfortably wear a T-shirt and a regular shirt underneath without it becoming too tight or too ""grabby"".  This hoodie seems well made with good quality materials.  I've had Dickie, North Face, Columbia, and L.L. Bean lined hoodies/jackets.  This Legendary Whitetails hoodie would be comparable to a similarly-priced Columbia."
William,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022",A+++,"Bought this before a trip to Galinburg and fell in love.  It’s as soft as it is good looking.  Hard to find clothes for a big guy like me, so this was well worth the money!"
Jason G.,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 7, 2022",My New Favorite!,"This jacket is so warm, I have to wait for ridiculously cold weather to be able to wear it.  I am 6'1"" tall with a 74 inch reach, so it's hard to find jackets that have sleeves long enough to avoid that wrist gap when wearing gloves - usually I have to buy 2X or 3X to get the right sleeve length, so thankfully this jacket comes in ""tall"" options so my arms can be covered all the way down to my gloves without having to wear a tent.  The lining is so soft and comfortable I find I'm spending more time outside so I don't have to take it off!"

ganymede,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 12, 2022",Value Your Money…Do Not Purchase these “Nike” Socks,"I would NOT recommend buying these ""genuine"" Nike socks.I have bought Nike socks before from both my local Sporting Goods store as well as from Amazon.I cannot help but wonder if these Nike socks are actually genuine because after the first wash cycle the socks shrunk so much that they now look like they are made for a child to wear! (Please see one of the photos posted.)It is surprising. I have never had socks transform themselves from a regular size sock into something so much smaller in one washload, with the dryer on medium heat, no less.Next, I noticed that the Nike socks had already begun to fray with loose threads, especially on the inside of the socks. Seriously, just two wash cycles and they look like they do, which is bad. (Again, please see the photo posted above.)As cited above, I have uploaded a few photos to illustrate the size difference between this Nike sock and a regular athletic sock. Both socks are ankle-cut in design.The other photo clearly shows how bad these socks deteriorated look AFTER just a couple of wash cycles.I hope this review informs you that these socks are of inferior quality; I'm not even sure they are genuine Nike socks! Regardless, these socks are not standing the testing of time"

My mistake, but does raise the question why these don’t follow conventional Nike sock sizes.  Now for the comfort.  I did wear them though they were tight. They are not soft.  Also after washing them they appeared frayed.  Again, I have suspicions that these socks might be fake, but can’t be sure.  Buyer beware."

But I have since ordered these “exact” socks directly from Nike and they are noticeably different. Better. So here are some thoughts.Amazon (L): thinner material, slightly scratchy, no “DRI-FIT” marking along toe, stretch out quicker and lose shape. Nike (R): thicker more cushioning material, very soft, has “DRI-FIT” making across toe, retain their shape.If your sole interest is look, these are fine. If you’re looking for true Nike quality and comfort, buy directly from Nike.Note: both pairs of socks in the photo have been worn the same amount."

More faded in spots than others and it looked Similar to another one that has been washed 100’s of times. Some of the stitching around the hand pocket was separating.I can’t return or exchange it because it’s too late but I will say this. I love Carhartt and trust it’s durability but this one sucks."

StarWars87,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 18, 2021",Couple things are off,This is a knock off.  I own several of these purchased through Carhartt and all are made in Vietnam.

Steven Romeo,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 29, 2022",Not Rain Defender,"The product was advertised as “rain defender”, however I just found out that Carhartt rain resistant hoodies come with a logo signifying that resistance on the sleeve. Mine, however, did not come with that so I just paid $60 for a normal hoodie."
Red,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 22, 2020",everybody loves it but me,"I think because I have a great old Dickies heavyweight hoody I have to compare it to it, and it doesn't stack up, except for the rain resistance. First the carhartt hoods suck compared to dickies, though the dickies heavyweight is discontinued r.i.p., maybe I have an elongated head, but carhartts hoods are always to stubby and tight, so when it's on your head and look down or sideways it pulls at your head. If you look straight ahead it's okay but they're always way to short and small, why not make them bigger and let the user adjust it? I got the tall which is at least 3 inches longer past the dickies tall, which I usually get because I want longer sleeves, and sadly though, the carharrt tall is like I'm wearing a dress, and the sleeves are only nominally longer. I do a lot of overhead reaching at my job and I hate short long sleeves. Maybe it's the rain defense, but the hoody is not as soft, thick or comfortable as other heavy weights, i'm sure it would soften with washing but it's still felt more stiff and thin compared to other heavyweight hoodies I've had. The quality seemed good, but not enough for me to accept the fit and comfort, so I'm returning it."
Jeff,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 4, 2022",Quality decreased,"I’ve been buying the rain defender hoodie for years.  This last hoodie I purchased releases sooooo much lint. Even after multiple trips through the wash/ dry cycle. I get covered in fuzz from the inside. I’m not kidding, like handfuls of lint/fabric from the inside. My method of washing and drying hasn’t changed. I’ve never had an issue with the many past rain defenders I’ve purchased. I may or may not try another rain defender in the future to see if it’s a fluke."
vanilla_rose316,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 23, 2022",Water resistance wears off quicker than advertised!!,"I have owned this shirt for about a year. It has been lightly worn and has only needed to be washed once and the rain resistance, which Carhartt claims will last for at least several washes is completely gone. They refuse to do anything more than give me a 10% discount on a new shirt. I have been loyal to this company for years but that is done."
KnuckleDragger,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 21, 2020",Fades quickly. Cuffs wear out first.,"I bought this sweatshirt to wear at work during Minnesota winters. I’m 5’7” and pushing 230 (shaped more like the ball, less like the the pin). I have a L but it fits like an XL/XXL compared to other brands. I do like the fit.My problem with this sweatshirt is that the color fades after 4-5 months of regular use. My job puts me in a warehouse one minute and a lawyers office the next. I can get away with a hoodie if it’s looking fresh, but my customers give me the side eye when I’m looking like I was just outside in the sun for the last year and a half.The cuffs are nice for the fact that they keep cold air out, but this design wears out the part where the sleeve meets the cuff prematurely, furthering the “tattered” look.With all of this being said, I am still a Carhartt guy. I just need to find a hoody that doesn’t look tattered after 4-5 months."
Dan Clifford,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 4, 2022",Poor quality,This shirt produces an unbelievable amount of lint. I'm not sure that it's real carhartt. The tag on the inside of the shirt shows a different size than the tag on the sleeve

Got a M and L as sometimes Carhartt runs large.Something is just off with these hoodies.  First, the head opening on both sizes was very small and a struggle to pull over head (I tried also thinking I could wear the M).  Then the binding around the bottom was really tight compared to other sweatshirts (on both of us - and I am a size 6).  The material is great - warm and heavy for cold weather.  Gray color nice too. Disappointed as we both really liked the hoodie otherwise."

Jennifer Mcrae,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 22, 2022",Not worth the price,I got this due to everyone saying it's good for cold Temps. I'm guessing all those people are bundled up underneath this hoodie as well as wearing something over it.It's about 45 degrees here and I'm really cold. I got this so I wouldn't have to bundle up but looks like I'll need to either wear a few layers under this or buy something thermal to wear under it. Either way I still have to wear a lot with this to stay warm.NOT WORTH THE PRICE shouldn't be paying more than 25 dollars for this..

The bad news is that the chemical that I assume helps make it water resistant is just too much to bear. I've washed it three times and even the spin cycle of the washer makes the chemical scent come into the house. Once dry, it's subtle but you always get a whiff, which for me, makes it unwearable!"

Jose,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 10, 2020","Not very soft, repels rain alright","I feel stupid writing this, but I didn't quite understand that the main draw of this hoodie is the fact that it repels water pretty well. Indeed, it does this job... ok. It's not a raincoat, but as far as a hoodie goes, it will keep you decently dry if you get caught in a bit of rain with no umbrella.What I also didn't quite understand, until I got this hoodie, is that one of the main draws of hoodies is their comfort and softness. This hoodie, no matter how many times I wash it, has held up very well and feels rather stiff... not soft. As a pullover, it's not the easiest thing to get on and off due to this stiffness, which can get annoying. That is a testament to how well it was made to withstand water, so I'm definitely not discrediting its name as ""rain defender."" Unfortunately, it does this while somewhat sacrificing one of the qualities that makes hoodies so nice.Just know that this is not a traditional hoodie that will get softer and more comfortable as time goes on. It will remain rather stiff, and I've had it for about 2 years now. Think about how often you use a hoodie indoors vs outdoors, and how often you get caught in the rain. I can safely say I would have rather bought a soft, normal hoodie, and just carry a damn umbrella... especially because this hoodie is pretty pricey for a pullover."

Only reason I didnt do 5 stars is because it does fade quickly so looks old pretty fast...and I wash cold water and use cleaners that are noted to reduce fading. Other items still retain good color so assume its something to do with the way the dye....otherwise very solid choice

The connoisseur of random things.,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 30, 2021",Great quality as expected.,"For the price, I'm satisfied with it, however it fits a bit large as others have said and expect from Carhartt.My main peeve with it is the overly baggy belly and slightly loose bottom cuff.Otherwise I love the quality, the material is sturdy, and heavy.As I've just received the hoodie I'm unsure how warm it will keep me but maybe a size down will improve the blanket effect.I'm 5'6 with a 40 something inch chest, so I normally wear larges which may be just right or a bit big on me, in this case I think I'll downsize to a medium.I give it 5 stars for quality, 4 for fit, but I'll see how a medium fits."

Kat Crippen,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 26, 2019",Great Sweater,+ absolutely love the sweater and I would give it a 5 start if I didn't have a love hate relationship with the neckline. Overall the sweater has kept more warm and it stands by the water resistant and I love that I don't have to stress about my sweater getting super wet after walking out in the rain or snow. The sleeves hug the wrist so that the cold air does't affect more than your exposed hands if they aren't in the front pocket. Hugs my waist the right amount see it doesn't try to raise up when I'm walking which is nice. Now to my love hate relationship with the neckline. I love it because it doesn't allow cold air to get in the top but I do wish it was a little bit more stretchy. Everytime I put it on I have to take my glasses off which is kind of annoying but I'm just happy it keeps me warm.
Big Bob,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",Super heavyweight,"This sweatshirt is replacing a 15 year old version of the same shirt. Super heavy, very durable and very comfortable. My label was perfect and unlike other reviewers, I’m quite sure this is the real thing. For sizing, I would agree that a size smaller then what you normally wear is probably good, but it really depends on how your using it. I wear mine for outdoor work and activities and almost always have layers under it. My old one was a 2xl so I bought a 2xl tall this time. I am 6’5” 260 lbs and the 2xl tall is pretty large. Again, I’m generally wearing it with layers underneath and I do expect some shrinking from washing, but it’s very large. I would estimate it’s 15% bigger then my original 2xl. Quality and rain defense is yet to be seen but these sweatshirts are very heavy, super rugged and normally very long lasting."
Evan,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",The go to hoodie,This has become my go to hoodie. I don’t usually wear them but the heavier weight cloth Carhartt uses drew me towards this purchase. You can tell it’ll handle rough conditions you may get into and rain can be shaken off. It has a nice hanger loop inside and the big pocket will keep your hands warm. The wrist cuffs are holding their shape and not stretching out like other hoodies and the hood can be worn comfortably with or without a hat. That’s really important to me. Most companies over size their hoods where if you don’t have a hat then it’ll be annoying. I’ll probably pick up another one to keep on ice
Bigboireviews,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 28, 2022",Best hoodie I have ever purchased!,"The quality of this hoodie is such a nice surprise! The material is durable yet soft and warm! I am so glad I found this brand.Here’s my tips for sizing: first I am 6’3” and 365 pounds, so I’m a big guy… I ordered the 3XL Tall and it fits perfect! The tall size covers my stomach nicely, but isn’t too long either! It is more on the snug end around my stomach when I sit down, but other than that, it truly fits perfectly!I am in between a 3xl and a 4xl in shirt sizes right now, but I would say go with your true size, or if you are in between sizes like me, you can go with the smaller of the two for a comfortable fit!I’m going to be living in this thing for the next few months! 10/10 recommend, especially to the bigger guys out there! We got a win with this one!"
Benholio,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 13, 2022",Super soft interior!,"I'm 5'10"", fluctuate between 190-200 lbs (I'm built like Kermit the Frog; skinny arms and a pot belly). The medium fits me perfectly. Most workwear brands tend to size quite large.The interior feels great- it is super soft. The water resistance is adequate for a light drizzle. The fabric is quite thick and heavy, so this hoodie is warmer than most others. Only thing it needed when new was a gentle cold water wash and tumble dry, as whatever the water resistant treatment they apply at the factory (I'm guessing that's what it was) leaves a little bit of a peculiar odor."
Russell Robert Paxton,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 4, 2022",Best Hoody I own,"First off, if you’ve never owned a Carhartt just know that it’s going to run big. I don’t mean a little baggy, I mean like a full size (or 2) big. I’m a firm XL guy, 230 ~5’ 11”,  but fit comfortably in a large. This is a throw on when doing yard work, chill in the air, don’t want a jacket, weather sweater.I can’t speak to its rain repellent properties as I’ve only owned it for a week and it hasn’t rained. I guess I could jump in the shower with it, but I’ll let Mother Nature do the testing for me.It is comfortable! Soft, heavy, but flexible. I don’t feel trapped in the hoody. Nice elastic on the wrists keep it from riding up.  Overall it feels really well made.Spend the extra cash,  it’s worth it."
Podo,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 29, 2022",Order a size down!,Love the hoodie! I normally wear an XL(tall if available) and I ordered a L tall and it’s a perfect fit with enough room to wear a couple layers or a smaller thinner hoodie underneath. Unless you’re trying to wear this hoodie over a coat or a ton of layers underneath I would order a size small.

The color is nice, feels pretty much the same quality, and doesn't shrink after drying for 50 minutes in the dryer, it left just a small amount of fuzz nothing to worry about.

D. B.,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 6, 2022",Sorry I ordered these socks,"Got these socks for my son who wears a size 16 shoe.  He cannot find socks to fit him ANYWHERE - period.  I ordered these because they said they were size 15 to 17.  I thought - great!  these have to fit him.  Wrong.  He had difficulty just getting them on his feet they were so tight.  They look long but the size is small.  This is the worst purchase of socks I have ever made.  They also smell bad.  I thought by washing them the material might loosen up but that did no good and the awful smell did not go away.  Even if they did fit my son wouldn't want to ruin his shoes because of the smell of the socks.  They also caused a huge mess all over the place because they have a ton of lint and these are black socks.  I just don't understand why we can't find a pair of socks for someone with large feet.  It seems like whoever is manufacturing socks nowadays makes them all a size 7 and then puts them in whatever package even a package that says size 15 - 17.  I've tried Amazon, Wal Mart, even King Size.  I give up."

I’m still wearing a couple pairs that haven’t gotten lost in the laundry. I wanted more for this winter so I ordered a brand that I knew. But these are way too tight on my calves at the top. The cut off circulation. Now, I am overweight, but my calves are probably the least overweight part of my body—It’s not like they are huge or anything. this is unacceptable so I’m giving them away at the laundromat because it’s too much trouble to return them."
C. Simmons,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 21, 2019","Never again, Dickies","Over the span of two and a half or three decades, I have tried a few items from Dickies and have been consistently disappointed.  These socks are certainly no exception.The problem is always the size with these guys.  I hadn't bought socks for myself in a long time and a year ago was surprised to find that I was able to get socks that were sized for my feet (14W) at a brick and mortar retail store!  Years ago it was nearly impossible to find socks that fit me, so I was pleased to see that the market accommodated for larger sizes.  These socks (from another manufacturer) were sized 12-15.So, those have worn down and I was looking for replacements when I came across these.  Seeing the sizing of 12-15 I figured I'd give them a shot.  It turns out that I cannot even get my toes down the neck of the sock, much less actually pull them on completely.  If I had to size these socks I would put them at a 9-12, not a 12-15.  I would gladly pay good money to see someone with even the most narrow 15 sized foot out there be able to get one of these on and still maintain blood flow to their lower leg and foot.  It's not going to happen, therefore, the sizing is pure science fiction.It's a shame really, because Dickies makes seemingly good stuff.  My work is sometimes very physically active and I need good, tough clothing.  But it seems that everything they make is just too small for me, which is odd considering some of the man-mountains I have seen sporting their brand.Anyway, if you are a little dude or a chick and you want to look like some big bad blue collar worker, then Dickies is probably right for you.  If you are in fact a big dude (like me) and want some good clothing, then move along.  Ain't nothin' to see here.The worst part is that I won't even be returning this since it will cost me more money in lost time than the stupid socks were worth to drop them off at a UPS place.  Well played, Dickies... you won this time, but never, ever again."
Mark Manning,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 4, 2016","The Good, the Bad, the Ugly, and the DANGEROUS","First, let me state that I am giving this a one star because a few things need to be fixed on this advertisement.The Good: Thick, keeps your feet warm, will not wear out any time soon.The Bad: The ad shows these as ""OVER THE CALF"" socks but what I got were ankle socks.  They say they are over the calf but they only went about four inches above my ankles.The Ugly: Unfortunately, Dickies has been caught by the English to Metric measurement bug. The truth is - everyone else in the world uses the metric system.  Only America uses the English system of measurements. This means that ""WHERE EVER POSSIBLE"" everyone else in the world ROUNDS DOWN when converting from English to Metric measurements. Secondly, when a company farms out their manufacturing process to overseas vendors - those vendors will try every trick in the book to save money. This is because ALL COMPANIES use what is called MAXIMIZING PROFITS (I call it MINIMALIST TECHNOLOGY). What this means is - they put in the least amount of goods and effort to get the greatest profit. Business people use the first to make it sound good - I use the second because that is what they really are doing. So in this case what they are doing is making the socks really be for a size 12 foot and then putting in some elastic to let it be put over a size 13 foot (and barely over a size 14 foot).  I pity the person with a size 15 foot.  How this type of sock used to be made was to make it for a size 14. It would be a bit loose on a size 13, just right for a size 14, and a bit tight on a size 15.  My feet are size 14 and I could only just brarely get the socks on. So if I am having problems at 14 - a size 15 foot would not be able to get these on.But here is the really bad part: You could really do some damage to your feet if you wear these socks. You could actually cut off the flow of blood to your feet if you wore these things because they are made so thick and they bind so tightly.  It would be like wearing a tourniquet around your leg.  What I would do is to see if you can't get the next size up from these socks.  Otherwise I would not buy them unless I wore shoes sizes 10-12."
Florida Countryside,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022","Every pair in the back, just above the heel","It's been less than three months since buying these socks, and every last pair developed a hole in the back, just above the heel. This appears to be a factory defect, because it happened in the same place on all pairs. Trying to save a buck by buying these is not worth it, and will not be buying these again."
JustBeachy,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 21, 2021",Wet notebook paper would wear better! Pilling while wearing 1st time!??,"Loved the brand, and the socks BUT-I was sooo DUPED. Don't you be. So, FWIW, gave to a friend who literally had them on for three hours, & they were already pilling-see photo! Holy sheiza! Jeebus!! I put on a different pair to see if they were ok, and wore them on indoor carpet for the evening. They area just as bad. So, they'll be returned with the honest complaints logged here. They didn't even get a chance to get ruined from being washed in the laundry- from the package to the feet to the garbage heap in 24 hours. What a disappointment that this lack of basic quality is being sold under a brand thats loved for its durability, no less! Buy different socks- this is no mistake- but a purposeful cheap and useless product  being sold. Don't encourage this by accepting this kind of carp! If product was anything like the quality that is in the description I'd be soo happy. Instead I get to waste my time & money to just get back to where I started + repackage & return them?!? I'm thinking of just throwing them out. These are so lousy, even worse than I could imagine. Put wet notebook paper on your feet, and it would be better than these.

YOU'LL BE THROWING ALL OF THEM OUT AND WILL END UP SPENDING MORE ON THE LONG RUN.When you buy something from Dickies you can typically rely on them being a quality product. Not so much with these socks. Since receiving my order in September of 2021 I have had to throw out all but two of the socks, and I only wear white socks on the weekends, and I had other white socks from Costco I bought the day before I received my shipment of Dickies socks. I still have all of the Costco socks.These are so terribly terribly put together and so poor quality that I had to throw out a pair after only wearing them twice. Why did I end up throwing them out? Holes. And not just one, but many all over the sock. I wore them twice and they ripped after being worn twice!! Pathetic.From that point on I wore the socks on laundry day and only on laundry day. Each pair developed holes after being worn only a couple times. Now, less than 4 months later, I have thrown out every single one of these socks due to holes. I cannot stress this enough. DO NOT BUY THESE! THEY ARE NOT EVEN WORTH A PENNY!"

Jennifer B.,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 8, 2022","well made and comfortable, but feel mostly polyester, cuffs are too snug","Well, these socks are a mixed bag. They fit perfectly except that after a while of wearing them I can see that the cuffs start to look like they are constricting my calf. When I take the socks off, it leaves very obvious cuff impressions on my calves.  (I'm a women's size 8 to 8.5 shoe and these socks sized 5-9 fit perfectly)These socks say they are mostly cotton, but I could immediately tell that the felt mostly polyester right out of the bag. Even after a few washes, they still feel like they are mostly made of polyester. And I've been wearing them more often now that summer is over because I wear the no-show socks in the summer which are 100% cotton. I'm developing eczema on my feet and I'm pretty sure it is due to these socks being made of polyester. They just don't absorb sweat and also hold in the heat. That is a really bad combo for socks. How Dickies can call them ""Dri-tech Moisture Control"" is beyond me. Seems like they are straight up lying.Oh, and having the name Dickies on the top of the toes is quite annoying. Sometimes when you quickly glance at it (because it is pretty glaring and draws your eye to it) it looks like ""Pickles"".  And a couple of other words I can't mention. Dickies should just put the name on the bottom of the sock like other companies do.I would return these but I missed the return window."
Anonymous,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022",Quality on The Decline,"I've had pairs of these socks last a year before getting a hole, and it was always in the tip of the big toe or in the bottom back of the heel as you'd expect. High wear spots, which is why they reinforce those. Not only did my last pack wear through in those spots in under 2 months, but holes formed around the upper ankle in a rub free area like I've never had happen on ANY sock before, but the whole sock just seems to be practically melting away visibly every time I put them on. If these are even authentic, which is a real concern they're not, they are certainly not made of the same quality materials they once were, and it's very noticeable. I'm going to order one more pack and give the benefit of the doubt I just got a bad batch, but other reviews are making me think that's just the current state of the product and I'll be returning them in short order."
Jenna,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 11, 2022",Lacks Durability,"I’ve bought these and the shorter style twice to truly give a try. The first time I thought was maybe a fluke but every pack purchased is the same thing: falls apart with humongous holes in the heels, metatarsal pads and big toe. We have purchased the correct size, wash them as recommended and only wear them once a day yet the garment falls apart. It’s not my washer/dryer for my other garments do not have holes in them and other brands of socks have held up 6 months+. I’m disappointed because I normally purchase the pants and shirts for work wear and they last great! I’m really not sure what’s wrong with these socks but my assumptions are the seam points and the knit style/thread count. If they added reinforcements to the heel and toe area to compensate for friction points from walking on job sites for 10+ hours a day, that could help but I really think this style of sock is more leisure vs durable like advertised."

The majority of the socks fit the same, but a few fit all differently. They seem too big, and maybe for the next size up? Mass production much? Disappointed because these are comfortable socks.

Periodically, I will by a couple of 12-packs, toss them in a dresser drawer, then open/use as I need replacements.  In opening the last pack, I discovered 3 bummers (see photo of unused/unwashed socks right out of their package).  As you can see, two are actually cut, and a third has a hole in the side.  Dickies has no interest in this matter, saying it is an Amazon issue.  Because I made this discovery beyond Amazon's 3-week return window they say I'm SOL.  While not a terribly big deal, it is annoying and reflects poor manufacturing quality.  My word of advice is to immediately open and check each sock upon receipt because it appears their quality control has slipped considerably.  For me, I'm moving on with a different brand."
Seve Sutton,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 20, 2022","Not the best socks ever, just ok, buyer beware.","Right out of the package these socks are wonderful. That said after a few washes in only a few months of use I have some how ended up with holes in some of these socks. I don't know what's causing that to happen and m best guess is that the material just isn't that durable. If you enjoy ""planned obsolescence"" then these socks are for you. You might get a year out of them you might get only 6 months. Either way that seems bad to me. I bought these socks for light work and some walking up to 4 or 5 miles at the most usually less. for that , and when they are brand new, they have helped a lot but if they are just going to fall apart this quickly I will look elsewhere for socks.  it feels like way too much drama over socks.Hope this was helpful."
Robert Allen Barker,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022",The socks are nice but they need to be a little thicker and the heel and the toes,I work out in the cold I need socks it will keep my toes with this one’s birth to a point. But they need to be a little thicker the hill on the toes. They’re already starting to wear a little bit
Dixie's Dad,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 16, 2022",What does a person expect?,"Seriously, these socks are just ""Ok"".  It is what one would expect for the price paid. The fit is just ""Ok"", the support is just ""Ok"".  The socks are about 3/4 cotton and the rest plastic.  They are not bad at all, but, compared to nice socks, like Darn Tough, these are junk.  There are no free lunches (except for the politicians) so, as has been said many times, you get what you pay for.  A vey good product for the hard working family, and, appreciate that they are available."
michael davis,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 13, 2022",Good quality sock BUT,BUT the ankle size is for someone with bean pole legs. If you have big feet and NOT bean pole legs these are not for you.
steve,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022",Don't buy these for their moisture control...,"OK socks. Good fit, decent comfortability, but moisture control? No way - at least not for me. My feet sweat just as much or more in these socks than they do in any other 'regular' socks."
Steve I.,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 10, 2022",Too tight around my legs,I have skinny legs and these sox are so tight that when I take them off at night my hole lower leg is compressed.  Other than that I love them.  Cotton/poly blend with some stretchable material too.  Price is really good. They run slightly large FYI.  Sizing is not smart.  My shoe size is 10.  Sox are 7-10 and 11-13.  Since I didnt want to be walking around in a size 7 I opted for the size 13.  Probably should have got the 7-10.
Dan,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",Good,"Like the comfort, price is good, not sure how long they will last,  so far so good"
RE,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 28, 2022",Holes,Bought the socks to hopefully keep my feet warm and dry on an Alaskan cruise. Knowing there was going to be quite a bit of walking on a couple of the excursions.  Biggest surprise and disappointment was how easily the socks are wearing out with only one use.  Only 1 pair out the the batch looks normal.  1 even ended up with a hole in the toe area.  The others have worn look on heals and back of the ankle after one time wearing.They did keep my feet warm though...
N,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022",Way smaller than they say,I wear 10 1/2 and these were way too small. Very nice socks though.
Pastor Robert Coronado,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 2, 2022",Not as advertised,"Socks started fraying after a hour of wearing, they slide down off of calves and feet still had moisture."
Daniel,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022",Nice Quality,"Received them today, just tried a pair and they are nice, not the best quality I have had in my life, but they are not bad either.The socks feel nice, they are a bit rough to the touch of my hand but they are fine whenever I wear them, I feel like they could have been softer.The socks are somewhat thick (which is good) and they are the same thickness all around, I wish the underside would have been a bit thicker for a better feeling while standing up.There are no stitches at the toes! the stitch is located just under where the toenails are (right on top of the last joint on the big toe) and you can barely feel it.I am not sure about the durability, they seem like they're gonna last for a while, I'd say maybe a year...Overall, they are good! I could see myself wearing those socks for daily stuff, but I wouldn't take them on a hike or something.I will keep the link to order more in the future when the ones I have will wear out."
Kevin,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 2, 2022",Feel as if they are Hanes Socks,"These socks are not the same quality I I bought when I went to BJ's to buy socks. Those socks are thick and you can feel the quality. These, are thin, and not as durable feeling as the ones purchased from my local BJ's for 11.99 for a 6 pack. I have purchased numerous pairs from BJ's and LOVE the quality.These, only time will tell. If they start developing holes in the bottoms after 2 or 3 times worn, as the Hanes often will, I will update this review. I am not holding out much hope for these and almost returned them once I felt the difference in socks. Thin is what I can say about these."
JW,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 6, 2022","Room for improvement, but good socks overall.","I bought the Dickies socks to replace some Hanes socks that I didn't like because the leg portion is too tight.  The Dickies are a nice improvement in that area... tight enough to stay up, but not so much that they compress my leg or numb my toes.  However, on the down side, the Dickies are not as well padded in the foot portion, and the ""Dickies"" name should be on the bottom of the socks, not on the top.  I don't know why, but my feet also feel cold in the Dickies.  Maybe because they're 72% cotton (another reason I prefer the Dickies over the Hanes)?Speaking of 72% cotton, these are going to shrink a bit.  Nothing horrible (for me at least), but if you're on the edge, go a size higher.Time will tell w.r.t. longevity.  The Hanes last a long time, so I hope the Dickies--a name synonymous with work clothes--are tough enough to hold up equally well.As an aside, since when did sock sizes get so ""one size fits all""-ish?  6-12 is a big size range (I'm a 10.5).  I miss the old 9-12 size, but there's not much I can do about that."
Top Contributor: Pets,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 8, 2022",Just like any other socks.,"I've been prompted to write some reviews, and I don't have much to say about these socks. They're socks.  I purchased them for a friend, and he said they were like any other socks, and do not differ from a cheaper brand. I thought they would be nicer, because they are Dickies, but it's not the case."
Leelee,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 5, 2022",Not sure if these are authentic or not,I've had the white ones of these in the past and the light gray ones so decided to get the darker gray ones this time and they fit as expected. But they seem to me to be a little bit thinner than the same ones I've bought in the store before making me think they're not real. I guess time will tell if the heels start wearing through earlier than my other ones which usually lasted about 1 year of wearing steel toe work boots and walking on concrete floors for 10 or 12 hours. It's these last a year then I'll accept that they're the real thing but until then I honestly believe they're fake just because there's so much thinner and less fluffy than the ones I've bought locally before.
Amazon Customer,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 6, 2022",Allergic Reaction? From socks,I really like these feel of these socks and put them on the day after getting them! Really comfortable fit but after wearing them for two days I woke up with extremely itchy reaction/ hives on top of my feet that has lasted 6 days now (that still comes back only at night?). So I have since stopped wearing them. I didn’t see anyone else say they had a reaction but I’m guessing I must have an allergy to the dye or material. Just thought I would share. Going to wash all of them a couple times and see if that makes them possible for me to wear.
Dove,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022",Longer not wider,I have purchased both the 15-17 and 12-15 sizes in crew.  The difference between the two just seems to be a bit of length in the top ankle and the length of the foot.I wear a size 12 6E and other socks were not cutting it.  The Carhart brand ran a bit small.  This surprised me because their sizing for men's uppers are spot on.
Ernie,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 30, 2022",Yep.,"Comfy and great value. A great durable, comfortable product at a great price like I’ve come to rely on Dickies for well over the years. They offer a 6 size window and being on the smaller end of the 6-12, these ran a tiny bit big for me and the heel patch runs a little high. Nothing noticeable while Im running around a busy kitchen in comfort on my feet all day though. Dickies you did it again 👏."
Robin H.,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 19, 2022",size 15-17 you'd think they would not be so tight.. need a looser fit,"At least the length is what I wanted.. bigger the foot the bigger the ankles and legs.. these feel as tight as any 12-15 sock which were never big enough, I have smaller socks that don't cut off circulation at the ankles and leave indentations on my calves should they roll down a little. I am hoping that with time they will natuurally stretch out, loosen and be more comfortable, They certainly seems strong and well made.. but a little more girth is needed for my feet and legs.. and that's with my losing 50lb in last 12 monthsI still have 3 unused pairs in the package, last pair I stuck a 1 litre bottle into each for a couple days to pre loosen.. did not work.. that is some good strong elasticity.."
Igneous,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",Little on the thin side.,On time delivery. USPS stuffed in mail box. How did they know it was socks ???? Could of crushed something !!!! Fit is really good. Little on thin side. Will take some getting used to. All & all I like them.
Keeble Rose,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022",Excellent Product,These socks are one of the best socks I've worn in my entire life. I am over 60 and I have been wearing socks from my youth but these socks are some of the best I've ever worn.They fit well. They are strong. They are really well engineered. They don't even feel like you have socks on your feet. They are so comfortable.I am going to buy more in the future for myself and to give away as gifts they are wonderful.
G. westberg,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",Great inexpensive sock,"These socks fit well, hold up, and are very inexpensive. I bought the larger size, hard to find in some sock brands. It always puzzles me why shoe stores carry shoe sizes to 13, sometimes larger, but socks to a size 12. Same for smaller feet. Walls of socks all the same size. These sock come is sizes, good news."
N. Owen,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 2, 2022",Best I have found!,"They fit well, but not too tight. The ankle in the right length for me (not too short, not too high). The cotton/poly blend can be a bit warm at times, but I live in south Florida so it's a problem with many socks. My only complaint is the heals wear out after a few months walking on tile. A reinforced heal would make these socks A+! Recommend buy."
J Schaeffer,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 2, 2022",Great socks - long lasting.,"These are the best socks. I bought some a year ago, and they still come out of the wash looking as good as they did when they first came out of the package. They are not stretched out and do not show any wear in the toes or heals - look pretty much new. According to my husband they fit well and are very comfortable. I've purchased another pack. Great socks!"
Pat McC,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",No holes in toes areas like most socks,i bought a ten pack of these socks a few months ago and where them everyday. i have not gotten 1 single hole in any of them like i do from the big toes of all other socks. tThese are the best socks i have ever seen.
Christopher D.,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 8, 2022",These socks are awesome!,"I've purchased these socks at least a couple or three times now. My kids (daughters) have wanted to borrow them, as well as an old girlfriend, and all have loved them, too. They're snug and comfortable, warm, fits just right. I wear them in the winter most. I'll buy again once my current 30 pairs wear out. :)"
Steve,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",Hold Up Well,"I am on my feet for 8 hours continuously at work, walking frequently, and like these as work socks, but I wear them all the time.  I've been buying these for years.  While they do cost more than Hanes or Fruit of the Loom crew socks, they last much, much longer in my experience."
Tweak,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 11, 2022","Not one, not Two","These socks are really very good and the while it seems that they come in pairs its really just a bunch of socks, but I digress. The size seems confusing since there is a 6-12 but they fit my 11 and a half feet perfectly. They are 72% cotton so there's is the terrifying possibility of shrinkage but I wash my stuff on medium heat anyway.All things considered I feel this is a good buy with plenty of color choices, a decent price for 12 ""pairs""  and free returns if you decide you need a larger size.I'm sure you can find these at most large department stores but the shipping was free (even without Prime) and I was out of socks. Yes I could have worn sandals but being retired I need a certain amount of things to complain about.Namaste"
Raleigh,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 29, 2022",Love these socks in winter,This review is for Dickies Men's Dri-tech Moisture Control Crew Socks Multipack.I made the mistake of ordering mid-crew the first time. I kept them but am happier with the full crew as the mid-crew  sometimes don't cover when sitting. I am size 13 but usually order the 6-12 size and the fit here is normal. They have a fairly small percentage of cotton but the synthetic feels good and they wear great (durable).
Frederick L.,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 30, 2022",Exactly what you’d expect,"I don’t feel the need to post a pic with this review. What u see is what I get. Same dickies socks you see at Fred Meyer, Walmart, etc. great deals this holiday I stocked up for the year. Great work socks stay above your boots. Elastic lasts all day your not messing with them constantly. Comfortable and breathable. Great work socks. Will buy again and again and again 🤣"
Roowa,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 7, 2017",Not what they used to be.,Bought this mock zip hooded sweatshirt as it was supposef to be the replacement for the discontinued K217. I noticed when ordering a tall  option was not available so I took a chance. When I received it it was clear this was not even close to the quality the old style was. I tried it on and it was way too short. The material and elastic waist and wrist cuffs are pretty coarse. I had worn the old style for over 7 years and it was beat but I wore it everyday. I don't think this new one would last half as long. It really sucks that such a good product was discontinued and replaced with an inferior one. More bothersome is the fact I really like this style but a 4X tall is not available. I'd still buy one if my size was available but I wouldn't expect the longevity I got out of the old style.
Erica H.,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 27, 2022",NOT COLOR SHOWN! It’s dark green!,Color is not as shown! It’s a darker green color.

Amazon Customer,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 29, 2020",This sweatshirt is huge,I'm 6ft4in and around 200lbs so I'm pretty thin. I usually wear xl in most clothes for the length. I read this sweatshirt was a large and I should size down so I bought the large tall so I could still have the length. When I put this thing on it looked like a was wearing a large tent. It was huge. I probably could've gone with a medium. Plus the fabric was so rigid it was hard to get on and off. I guess I just didn't know what I was buying or how large it was.
Wesly,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 8, 2022",My body. My choice.....remember?,One star for the mandates. Came back to leave a review and say this was the last piece of carhart clothing i will ever purchase. Switching to wool for warmth. Plenty of it to be found at the thrift stores.

Jojo,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 3, 2022",Comes short on quality.,Bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He currently has one that he received from his work. His old one got bleach spots on it.  He really liked it so I wanted to get him the same one. I got this one a few weeks before Christmas and it looked great but after 3 washes it started to bead up all over. Not sure if this is a legit Carhartt sweater. The one from his work never beaded up.
kurt,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 7, 2022",Quality and Company going downhill,I’ve ordered three of these over last two years. The first one was awesome and I unfortunately stained it at work. The following two were both a huge downgrade in quality and fit. Carhardtt seems to be pandering to a different customer base than it’s traditional one. Shame.
Dad,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 6, 2021",Rain defender?,"Freezing rain fell this afternoon. Just walking from the building the 30ft to my truck, I was soaked. COMPLETE false marketing. This is NOT a ""rain defender"" product, the rain soaked right in like a normal cotton sweatshirt. Fit was pretty good and it IS warm and comfortable.6"
Kaleb legarda olveda,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 11, 2021",Not worth the price,Get a size smaller than yours. This sweater really isn’t it. It pretty heavy and stiff but that’s the problem. If you want to be warm it will not warm you. And it was a weird chemical smell; I’m guessing cause of the water proof material. It is not worth the price. You can get similar sweaters for way cheaper elsewhere.
Mike ,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 1, 2021",Too small and side pockets openings too tight,"Have bought multiple rain defenders sweatshirts in 3XL Seems the fit has changed.  1-2"" smaller in the chest and the side pockets openings are 2"" smaller and the pouch is too tight.

May,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 30, 2022",not oversized,I almost assumed from some reviews that it would be larger than normal and almost ordered a size down and Im really glad I didnt. Im normally a 2x and its a 2x tall and barely fits. It doesnt cover my rear and Im only 5'6. It squeezes my arms and chest. Most uncomfortable. Probably will just gift to someone else.
Edward Ehrat,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 1, 2022",Heavy with small hood.,"I like the style. The fabric is kind of rough, not soft like lightweight hoodies. The hood is very small, barely covers my melon. The color is not as bright as I thought it would be but still okay. Feels very warm."
Krista,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 9, 2020",Hood is too small :(,"*Update. I wanted this so bad. It works great in the rain as I just got hit hard and had to shake the water off as it never soaked in but the hood :( You can see even when I pull it forward it barely covers my face and my head is large but not abnormally so. Just something to keep in mind if you order this. Carhartt please make the hoods bigger!Only complaint is I wish the hood was bigger and overhung a little. I have a larger head but nothing crazy and if it rains my face will get it. I am 5’7” woman at 135lbs and I ordered a small. I can’t wear women’s jackets as they tend to be too short at the sleeves and sometimes the torso. This fits beautifully. I wore it all day yesterday and I couldn’t be happier at the comfort and warmth. I love pull over hoodies but the 1/4 zip gives room and opportunity to cool off or keep more heat in.I will update after I wear it in rain (won’t be long it’s PNW and November) and after wash.I grew up in Alaska and we know the quality of carhartt. I have a zip winter hooded jacket that I’ve had since 2000 that’s still kicking and my husband wears his stuff much harder than I do (infantry, biker, mr fixit, camping) and his has needed some stitching up after he beat it up but it still works beautifully to keep you warm and dry and refuses to give it up and has yet to wear the new one I got him."

Francy Metzger,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 20, 2022",Ironing the inside is a must do for this shirt.,"This is a great buy but.... you have to turn the shirt inside out and iron it on a low heat setting to bind the fibers because it leaves your under shirt full of that fuzzy stuff. After you iron it then wash it, it's perfect. I like the weight of it. It's like a jacket. It's comfortable. When it's cold, windy, chilly or damp outside, I'm not feeling the weather on my upper body."
Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 31, 2022",Not impressed,The material isn't like any of my other Carhartt items. It started to pile on the 1st wear. I have the same hoodie in another color that I bought at a store and it has worn totally different with no issues.

And it does.Well made and very warm.Will purchase again when these wear out.This got 4 Stars because of the Color not its quality.
Ryan C.,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",Great sweatshirt,"Great fall sweatshirt.  As it gets colder into the winter with temps below 40-ish, you have to layer with a jacket.  Didn’t absorb water under a light rain drizzle which is good, but haven’t tested it with stronger rain and would probably wear a rain jacket and not trust the repellent."
Richard D. Thomson,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 16, 2022","Nice, thick, but...","Heavyweight feel. The quarter zip with neck coverage is a nice touch (top of the zipper does NOT have a fabricguard for extra comfort). For some reason, most rainguard hoodies like this one have just the right sleeve length (my shirt size 34/35) that ride up, a little and enough to be annoying, when the arms are extended. Maybe a Large Tall would be better? As it stands, I would hesitate to put this in the dryer.Update 11/19/22. 56° outside and this hoodie failed. I only had a t-shirt on underneath, but I was hoping for a better the result. Maybe the heavyweight hoodie would be better."

I normally wear an XL in women's, ordered a Large in this. Runs big. It's wider than expected. Wish it was a hair longer to cover more of my booty with leggings, but it works. Heavier than normal sweatshirt material. Wore in light rain and it kept me dry. Overall, I consider this one a win."
TOMMYBOY,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 10, 2022",My only gripe is the strings on the hood,"This is a great hoodie.

Ladies my weight can fit the medium, but it's not as cozy to me😌. Also, the hoodie is Green in color, not blue as the picture shows so that's the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. Although it's not as cutesy as I'd like it to be, I'll be keeping it because these are the warmest hoodies I've ever owned, they really do repel the rain, and they last forever!"

The quarter-zip, mock turtle neck collar really seals out the wind and provides dual protection for the neck and lower face. while the hood is just large enough to completely cover a baseball cap, as a hood should be.(Some people think that a knit cap is the preferred companion for a hood, but a wool baseball cap provides adequate insulation, and increased water protection, while also forcing the hood to turn with your head, so that you can look over your shoulder. Combine that with a micro fiber balaclava under the cap and you're golden.)While warm and heavy, the body of this hoodie isn't bulky, so can easily fit under any coat and most jackets, but I don't need one that often, with this. A full sleeve compression undershirt plus this hoodie is good down to 40 degrees, at which point I just add the aforementioned balaclava and a good pair of gloves. I don't add the coat until 30 degrees, or so.If you're frantically reading hoodie reviews in order to get your monies worth, you're done!"
Holly,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 13, 2022","Thick, high quality hoodie","Carhartt is always great quality but this hoodie is amazing. More like a heavy sweatshirt/borderline jacket weight (its got weight to it!) Boxy fit not slim, roomy but not huge.  Easily can fit a tshirt and another shirt under it with comfort. Carhartt is simply a high quality product in general. Always worth the price. Their products run just a bit big but my kids are big / athletic so it fits them great."
Laura Silva,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 13, 2022",Great quality,"I bought the hoodie for my husband, he found out about the brand not long ago and bought a couple of hoodies before. He loves his new hoodie even though the color wasn’t exactly like the picture. The picture looks like a rusty orange, but the one we got was more like a salmon shade, but he kept it."
Graham Donaldson,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 18, 2022",Best Sweatshirt I've Ever Owned,"I have had 3 of these over the last 5 years and will be getting my 4th this Christmas.  These are hands down the most comfortable/best wearing hoodies I think money can buy.  My first is from 2017, I wore dailey throughout the winter months working on a large commercial grain farm.  Its still around, tattered, stained, and faded but I still wear it working outside in the dirt and grime.  When new these hoodies look very nice, during the winter months is my go to apparel for going out on the town.  With the extra collar and quarter zip it makes it look nicer than a plain old hoodie.  Also the quarter zip is nice because its not all up under your throat making the neck hole feel small.  All in all I'd give this thing 10 out of 5 stars if I could.  I dont like winter but breaking out this hoodie for the first cold snap makes it a little better.  I'm not a Carhart fanboy, I think some of the stuff theyre doing politically is dumb, but you can't deny that they make some damn good clothes.  For the price you can't get a better sweatshirt.  I'm 5'10"", 240lbs and I wear a 2XL.  Its plenty relaxed but isnt baggy enough that it looks like its oversized.  Just Buy It!"
Stacy brown,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 24, 2022",CARHARTT,Love these 1/4 zip hoodies. Fits a bit big I normally wear a large however this is bigger than my last one. It's the original fit and this one is the loose fit. Great Hoodie love the color and the fabric is super soft. I have not used it in rain or snow yet so not sure how good the rain defender works. Worth getting if you work outside and in the cold and windy weather.

Kristen,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 12, 2022",Absolutely love this hoodie,Fits just like I expected. I usually wear a large in women’s tshirts and large in men’s. Wanted a more comfy fit so it was able to be worn with a shirt or two under it which is perfect. The length is right at the belt line with a slightly tight stretchy band. Still like it. It’s not bad at all. The arm length is perfect to reach the ends of my hands. When it’s on my wrists the sleeves are a little bunchy but do take into consideration I’m a woman buying a men’s hoodie so the fit will be different. The chest fit is pretty loose. I’m a D cup and it’s still loose and larger fitting. And definitely keeps you warm. I wore it to work with just a tshirt on a day it was in the 30s and it was perfect. Keeps heat in really well.
Danielle Joseph,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 29, 2022",Tore at inseam after 1st wear.,"My husband loved these pants, they're soft and comfortable. I saw and ignored the reviews stating that it tore or ripped easily.. I thought ""ah maybe those ppl were rough with it""..but let me tell you. He wore this to drive to the store and then sat in 1 spot for 3hrs. Then took it off to see a rip along the seam. Smh.. It is just deeply flawed!!

Amazon Customer,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 12, 2022",Buyer Beware… sizes are not correct,All Amazon clothing from my experience do not fit the way they should.

If you get the medium the waist kinda fits but the rest is like wearing tights.I also ordered an Amazon hooded sweatshirt size Large and it fits like a medium. Im 6 foot 185lbs. Everything I wear is a size Large. My waist is a 34. Nothing from Amazon fits the way it should. Buyer Beware!!

But seriously, I’m 6’1 200 lbs and worn XL my whole adult life. I could fit in one pant leg. It’s like a couple’s warm up pants. Your girl could just jump on in with you. I can only imagine how obese the kid that made these think Americans are. My only hope is they shrink 4-5 “one more bite”’s after being washed."

Unfortunately upon arrival, one of the pockets had a large 2 inch hole. Since I needed these pants for a trip, I did not have the time to exchange them for a new pair and I ended up repairing the hole myself.Aside from the loose fit and damaged pocket, the material was very soft. I like how the drawstring ends have metal tips. If I were to buy these again, I’d probably size down."
Amazon Customer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2021",Small. AMAZONS PREDICTIVE SIZE DIDNT WORK!!,"1: this is more of a mens Tina pant type of material. Very soft and comfy, but not what I was intending to buy, I was hoping these could pass as softer black jeans/chinos. Maybe that’s just an oopsy poopsie on me or smthn. But either way these are exactly like womens leggings, since these were to tight (ACCURATE FOR A AIZE MEDIUM, I’m a size XL but Amazon said I’d fit a size MEDIUM. Way off on amazons predictive sizing but ok).2: form fitting in the front but I’m pretty positive that had to do with the size being wrong for me, otherwise it’s good leisure pants. Not really leave the house pants but that’s just my opinion. Overall, nice pants. Just not for me."

Craig,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 30, 2022",Sizing too big; lint all over my socks,"Pros: soft, very warm, and comfortableCons: sizing runs large; lint everywhere after 3 weeksYou need to size down. I usually wear a medium in any kind of drawstring/elastic waisted pant. Not only did I think I needed a medium, Amazon suggested a medium was the right fit based on my purchase history. WRONG! The pants nearly fall off when I put my phone in them, and I have to cinch the drawstring all the way down to keep the pants on. I’m constantly pulling the waist up, which is super annoying when I mainly wear them around the house. Granted— I should have walked around with them on for a few minutes before washing. Returns through Amazon are easy, so I could have fixed the sizing myself.On the other hand, I cannot solve the lint issue. I looked down today (I’ve had the pants for maybe 3 weeks), and there is a TON of lint from the inside of the pants all over my socks. Kind of annoying. Hoping they hold up."
Solo,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",Falls short of its potential,"Quality fabric and stitching.  Excellent waistband and draw strings.  Good fit from waist to knees.  Regretfully, the fit around the calves is skin tight for a 5’ 9”, 140 pound man.  These are jogging pants, not skinny jeans!  Also, the ankle cuffs are poor substitutes for traditional elasticized pant leg bottoms.  If these shortfalls are fixed, the pants will be excellent."
amas92,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",Great fit but major downside is that it sheds fluff everywhere,"For the price, these are good joggers that come in a nice color and fit well. But the major downside is how much fluff they shed behind, which is a telltale sign of cheap fabric. As such, these are challenging to wear around the house and are best served outdoors."
W Geitner,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",Large waist short legs,I am swimming in the waist yet the pants are still way to short.Apparently Amazon thinks human beings are more wide than tall because these are ridiculously cut.

Reborn Flattie,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 25, 2022",Weird fit.,Horrible fit. Huge waist and short legs. Maybe these would fit if I was built like Humpty Dumpty or if i liked droopy drawers with my underwear on display.  I rarely leave the house with these because the short narrow legs are constantly pulling my britches down. In the past I had bought a couple pairs of these in different colors but they must have changed the cut because these don't fit as well as the others did.
KevinGG,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 26, 2022",big,bigger than expected . Large was super wide in the waist and would be too loose. Maybe i should think of large as in average american sizes .

Dan,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 8, 2022",What fit do you want? If fitted go smaller.,"If you like fitted clothes go a size smaller I think, but most a medium would work. I am 5'11 189lbs and a large was too baggy even after washing.I bought a large and medium. Needed 2 pairs.The difference between two are a big step.So the medium will be to wear out of the house and the large for at home or cleaning.The large was very long the ankles and waist are elastic but too much extra length for my height.

Junie B,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 22, 2022",Good quality overall,"Purchased a medium brown XL in Jan. 2022, and a toffee brown in large Jan. 2022.  The first pair was too big for my husband.  I didn't return them, but certainly can't fault Amazon for that.  The Large in toffee brown did fit. My husband is 5' 10"", has a big stomach, and is stocky overall, rather than slender.  I decided to have a duplicate of that 2nd pair, but when received them today, found that the duplicate pair had excess material in the legs (and also was too tight at the bottom).  I plan to bring them to a UPS store for a return.  These pants are an excellent quality for the price, if you get a pair that fits. All three pairs purchased by me were of a medium weight, of a nice quality material, and had well-made pockets and neat stitching. This will be my first return of an Amazon product.  The process is easy.  I chose to use the option of free return via a UPS store, and plan to return them early next week. With a return process this easy, and the quality of the pants, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another pair in Large for my husband, trying for a more standardized fit.  You can't go wrong with Amazon!12/03/22 Just received 2 additional pairs today, one Large and one Extra Large. My husband gained weight this past year and fits better in the XL. I purchased two sizes so that he will have a pair to move down to when (if) he loses the extra weight.  Yes, these pants are worth it!!  They are well constructed, with good stitching, the material is nice, and the waist band expandable. One caution for those who may have purchased them last year and are now considering purchasing more: The pants are exactly the same cut and size as those from the previous year, but the elastic waistband for the two I purchased this year do not expand as easily or as far as the bands on the 2 pairs that I had purchased last year.  If your waist is an issue and you are between sizes it might be best to choose the larger size."

Some part of my affection for the pants is based on the price and if they were 25% more I might give them 3 stars but at the super budget strike point I love them.The only issue is that I bought large and I am only 5'11"" (1.8m) and the legs are about 2-3cm shorter than would be perfect."
Amazon Customer,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022",Highly Recommend,"LADIES!! These fit just slightly loose. As long as they’re tied they stay up just fine. Length of pant leg goes down all the way (right below ankle). I bought these with low expectations because they were so cheap, but the quality is amazing! They’re so soft inside, and are relatively thick. I got a men’s large (normally do women’s large) which I assume is why they are looser fit. These are perfect for anyone."
Caitlin,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",Really nice!,"Im a woman, I’m 5’7 with long legs and 170lbs. I have a small butt and thighs. The medium fit me perfectly. If you are the same weight/height as me but with a larger bottom half then you’d probably need a large. I like these because the butt area is smaller and fits me better since they are mens. They come to about an inch above my ankle."
Handy-Man,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 5, 2022",Comfy cozy and value,"I grabbed these to replace an aging pair of champion sweatpants that have seen better days.First off, Amazon suggested the size based on my previous orders and it was spot on!

Safety Guy,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 20, 2022",Not very supportive.,"Rating was reduced to one star, because there is no indication of no star:  Length for warmth. But no front support, just loose fitting. There is perfect feeling of fit and assurance, on the legs. But on the front, where it matters, there is the absence of feeling, the sensation of discomfort because there’s no credible specific support. Colors or style, or contrast stitching don't matter.  It's what counts.  The photos showing the presumption of a front, contoured support, do not 'support' the actual garment itself.  There isn't any of the picture contour of the front that exists when wearing this undergarment. Candidly, it should be the form of a cup, that actually acts like like a supportive sewn in area.  Akin, politely said, to a brassiere, that should have the support feature yet it's only a loose fitting fabric that offers no assurances.  Let this be a lesson for the ones who sell mens' underwear:  Tell the truth about your product, that it performs when the product is worn."
Buck Wicklund,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 25, 2022","Very disappointed, after a couple hours, no support","I'm really disappointed.  These boxer briefs feel really comfortable when first put on, then shortly lose all support.  After 2 to 3 hours of normal activity, moving around the house, walking, or golfing, I might as well be wearing regular boxer shorts.  The boys are just hanging out.  I've even tried changing to a new pair after half a day, but still no good. I get more support from my 5 year old pairs of Hanes standard white briefs even after wearing them all day.  The price on these boxer briefs was good, but like me, if you want support, these are not for you.  I did buy the correct size, medium for a 34"" waist, normal body size."
Jacob S.,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 12, 2022",Get the next size up,"I don't get what's so difficult about making underwear, but if you're a 36"" waist like me, get the next size up. I don't get why, but the solid color ones are the worst for fit. They're so tight, if I've the odd yet inevitable itch, I have to risk tearing the elastic just putting a couple fingers past the waistband. The ""good"" pairs aren't much better. I should've returned them when the first ones seemed snugg just passing my calves. Even washing everything after wearing them a few times hasn't gotten anything to relax."
Jordan C.,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 30, 2022",Quality is absolute trash,"They fit great and feel great.... for about 3 minutes.....the first time you wear them.The legs get super loose the moment you start moving around, which I could put up with. But the hems of each leg on every pair also started tearing right at the seams with I put my pants on and raleach down the pant leg to tuck the brief legs down straight. My fingers go right through the seams, and I swear I'm not pushing hard or anything.I've heard this and that rumor about the same branded product that you could buy in a store being worse quality when purchased from Amazon, but this is the first product that has made me believe it. These literally fell apart the first time I wore them.Do not purchase. Make the inconvenient trip to a store and get some off the shelf. Or buy a different brand, at least."
Kristyne,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 26, 2022",Terrible quality!,"So, for starters the quality coming out of the package is fine. You could tell that they would wear and strech easily, so they wouldn’t have lasted long anyway. We wash everything new before we wear it- you never know where it is coming from or if it was a returned item, not to mention how dirty new products can be from manufacturing.Anyway, none of that really matters because 2 of the 6 came out of the washer like this before the first wear (yes, wash instructions were followed). When I asked my husband what he thought about his he said he was NOT a fan because they were not good quality. He said upon putting the first pair on, of the ones that were still in tact, the waistband made a tearing sound as if it was not attached well. VERY disappointing. I will be asking for a refund."
Shager670,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 17, 2022",Do Not Buy These,"This is the second time I have purchased Hanes Boxer Briefs.  The first package was fine -- good quality product.  The second, recent package is close to junk.  One pair had the waist band separate from the briefs fully one third of the way around the entire waist.  This was after two washings and one wearing.  The hems on the legs also have the sewing pulling out on at least two pair.  Hanes has switched to a new factory in Guatemala.  It obviously wasn't a good choice."
Shawn,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 22, 2021",Inconsistent quality,"Let me start out by saying that there are three different types in this one pack. The first being that the grey pair has a different material makeup. I noticed this in the description and is not a big deal. Now let's get to the other two...First the red, blue, and green: these three pairs have weird stitching along the bottom of the leg holes. Due to the stitch type, they do not stretch. I work in the textile manufacturing field with sewing operations and this is not something that I would expect on this type of clothing. I am an average size person (6 foot tall, 200 pounds) and these boxers are uncomfortably tight on the thighs. So tight that I actually debated leaving work on lunch break to go home and change. Maybe these are a good fit for chicken little  or someone without legs? Also they are a little tight in other areas with very little stretch it you catch my drift.The black and grey pairs have a normal stitch along the legs which allow them to stretch and fit. A better fit in the thighs, but still tight in other areas.I love my older style Hanes ""comfort cool"" but would not recommend these ""comfort flex"" to anyone except chicken little or someone with a chicken little body build."

Jimbo,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",Does not match the pictures,"Very short to run down your leg.  I am 5'10'' and if i pull these up they would go past my belly button.  The models show about 6 inches covering your leg. These ones have 2'' or less.  These are new meant for anyone with a skinny torso, unless you like them saggy like boxers.  All the excess on top for a high waste line looks like it's meant to stretch and contour belly fat. Very disappointed..."
Brandon Viger,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 19, 2022",Materials used are not what they used to be.,"These used to be my go to’s . Never again, the materials are definitely not the same, they feel scratchy and thin. The knee length boxer briefs , or long leg as they describe. Only reach just past mid thigh, and the elastic that’s supposed to stop them from riding up, stretched out within 2 weeks. Definitely not the same product! I used to love Hanes for all my undergarments, A frame undershirts included. The product is not the same, materials feel cheap and lacking of the quality and standards the company has been providing and known for generations."
Mark,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022",Weird fit,I am disappointed at the fit of these boxer briefs.  The waist band rides very high and does not fit like any other boxer briefs I have worn.  Looks like old man underwear that sags in the crotch when you wear them with the waist band in a normal position.  I won't be buying them again.
Chris,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 11, 2022",The thinnest material Hanes could manufacture,"The material is very thin, I don't see these lasting more than a few cycles in the wash unfortunately. The fabric is a little scratchy around the legs. They seem very long for boxer briefs. I'm 6 feet even and the briefs go more than halfway down to my knee cap.As others have noted, only the black ones are 100% cotton. That being said, I think the blended material is more comfortable."

Keylin,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 27, 2022",Ugly AF,"My husband didn't like these nor do I. They look like shorts, are not confortable as they are so big.

Awesome fit, lightweight and soft, form fitting where it matters.  Shockingly good, I guess we'll see how they hold up.

Andrew Robinson,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 13, 2022",My new favorite brand of underwear,I received a pair as a gift at the top of the year never opened the package until this month the boxers felt so good to me and get this. “They did not ride up on me while doing any physical activity” I’m a guy with big muscular thighs and my underwear get their use in a warehouse for 12 hours I hardly even notice I have on underwear lol. Believe me I tried a lot of brands even designer brands like polo Calvin Kline etc they all felt like wet towels when they got a little moisture and always rode up on me. How embarrassing having to pull down your boxers in public but no more after I opened that package I received as a gift I threw out all my other boxers and ordered more and I have more in my cart currently. Really happy with this purchase. The only thing I have a gripe about is the waist is kinda of tight it that could be just because they’re new and not use to my body yet.

Dave,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 16, 2022",Good shape,"I like the shape of these boxer briefs. They seems to hug my thighs just right and keep everything else in place. Some brands just feel like long shorts. I found these to be form fitting, but not uncomfortable. I ordered a 2XL and they fit pretty well considering how big I am. Something often overlooked is color. I prefer neutral tones for undergarments and this pack is grey and black. Couldn’t be any more perfect, they just go with anything.

I was lucky enough to get this for mere $15, and have not regretted the purchase. However, as it is getting colder now, this ""jacket"" is mainly useless. Also, its quality is atrociously bad. Not to mention, it is actually embarrassing to wear it, that's because as soon as you need to take it off, under certain lighting condition, it will look like a floor-rag, like literally the trashiest piece of clothing -- useless and worn solely for the looks. If you want to draw people's attention, oh yes you will. In all honesty, it does look quite good from afar, but under even slightest observation, it reeks cheapness and showiness.Just look at this ""beauty"" in the picture -- it says it all."

I bought this bright orange jacket to wear while riding my bike.  It's been warm so the jacket has been sitting since I received it in September - after a very quick trial fit it went in the closet.  Now that it is cold and time to wear it, I noticed the defect.  For the price I did not expect a Patagonia, but I did not expect misalignment in the pattern either.  Just very poor quality control and workmanship.  Otherwise, it would be a bargain buy."

erco,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 7, 2022",Barely Worth $20,"I had high hopes based on the ""#1 Best Seller"" rating and 4.5 star reviews but this is a MEH jacket at best. The prices vary wildly by color, which is downright silly. Barely worth the $20 I paid, nothing more. I just wanted a cheap blue jacket and that's exactly what it is. Nothing great about it.  Thin, not very warm. Not a ""puffer"" jacket by any means. No warmer than a sweatshirt. Color is accurate to the webpage, a mediocre blue. The fit is big & loose & goofy, I ordered Large but likely a Medium would be a better fit. Probably so large because (just as pictured) you'll want to wear a hoodie underneath if it's cold. Zippered pockets are fine. Inside pockets on both sides could hold an iPad each. Material is quite thin (may wear quickly) so it might pack up fairly small, if that matters to you. Comes with a thin seperate stuff sack I'll lose quickly. Overall 2/5 stars, warm enough for  Los Angeles but not suitable for any place with real winters. I want to know why the prices vary so wildly between colors from $20 to $40+, even varying daily. Wait, is this the stock market? Are prices being manipulated by the cheesy thin jacket cartel?"
Buster,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022",Zipper crapped out,I really loved this jacket since it compared to the LL Bean unit I gave to my son.

Material and construction seem to be of decent quality considering the source and price point.  When I put it on it felt great until I lifted my arms and more so pointed them forward.  The tightness across my back back felt like I ordered an X-Small.  Not sure if I got a bad one or they cut this for a super skinny crowd, but it gave it a Chris Farley feel.  Definitely do the Try Before You Buy, if you’ve got any substance of a chest/shoulders.  Everything else was sized right.  Wished it would’ve worked, I’d have 2-3 for every pack, boat, etc."

I just need to wear a thicker shirt under it.UPDATE: The zipper, at least on my jacket, is very finicky and unless you are careful to push it all the way in and then zip, it will eventually come undone from the bottom. It's done that several times."
Greg P,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 24, 2022",Worth the money but fit...,"Okay, there's not much to complain about considering the cost.  I mean, what do you expect for $35 bucks.  I got it to wear in the boat and throw in the truck when I don't care what really happens to it.  And if it warms up I can stuff it in the bag.  So far it is warmer than expected, that's a good thing.  I haven't worn it in rain, though I wouldn't wear it as a rain coat. It may be okay in light sprinkle or mist.But the fit.  (See my size for reference below)I ordered a large and the fit was pretty good but the sleeves were way too short.  So I exchanged it for an XL and now the sleeves are right but the fit is significantly too loose.  It's alright, I'll keep it and on colder days I can wear a vest underneath because there is plenty of room.  Again, for the money you can't expect too much.  It isn't a Marmot, or Patagonia (Both of which are overpriced IMO) or even a Columbia so don't expect too much.  It seems pretty good for the money.  And for reference.  I'm, 6'2"", about 185-190 lbs.  I wear a 16 1/2, 34-35 dress shirt, chest is about 41-42"". Usually typical men's large sizes in various apparel fit, like a Carhart tee shirt for example."

TruthHertz,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 10, 2022",Get a size smaller,"I'm 6'4"", 180lbs, thin athletic build with slightly longer arms. I bought this jacket, in medium, to use as an underlayer for a larger coat/jacket. It is waaay too long and loose for that.I don't know if all the different colors are sized differently but mine is labeled ""medium"" and in no way can be considered such. The pic of me wearing the jacket is essentially how all my ""large"" sized items fit me. This may be just the jacketI got; maybe other mediums fit...All Amazon ""essential"" products come from different contracted manufacturers for the same product, so I know there will be inconsistencies, and sizing is probably one of them.But THIS jacket ain't a medium.The jacket isn't a full fledged puffy jacket that makes everyone look 4 inches fatter...which is okay. It's just a thicker windbreaker in my eyes. Which is why I wanted it as underlayer for a heavier coat. Being a larger size makes it loose and drafty and defeats the purpose of my purchase.I highly recommend getting a size smaller if you are looking for a ""true"" medium fit in gray....if you're looking for a loose outer medium-thickness shell for your MEDIUM hoodie, this is your guy.UPDATE: I ended up purchasing a small, black version under Prime's try-before-you-buy and it fits exactly how I wanted it. Buy a size smaller."

Dan,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 8, 2022",Depends on the fit you like. See more for good info.,"Really great for the price $22 I got a large and ordering a 2nd that is medium, if I used it a lot (or it cost more) I would get something more durable like a name brand. But price wins and it is warm, it works for what I use it for. The fit is more of a traditional fit that is to say a large is baggy for my slim fit preference. I am a man who is 190lbs 5'11. Before the pndmic I was 175 (got gains) and would have gotten a small knowing the sizes haha #goals.If you want a long term thermal go buy a brand name it will look 6 times better, but this thing has its place for sure!! I like things more tight fitted and in my post pndmic body i'd get a medium or probably a small to wear under a jacket. So if I was 175-180 i'd probably get a small I think to wear under stuff, but a medium if its the main thing and you don't like fitted clothes.I planned to get 2 of these with one to wear to work and another to get dirty from yard work and outside things. I first ordered a large and it is baggy for my preference but probably what most men would want. I like fitted clothes and have ordered another one in size medium to wear to work. I am keeping the large for yard work and other things. Great to have 2 or 3 instead of one high priced item.Hope it helps!"
Avant,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 26, 2022",Good cheaper alternative but not for heavy use,"I bought for the purpose of travel and outdoor use in those times where temps can change drastically from 70F in the morning down to 40F at night.I got this on sale for $20 which was a far cry from $60-120 asking price of other packable down jackets. For the price, it's much warmer than I thought and has well thought out features. So far I've worn this in 42F weather, coldest and just going on a walk I was breaking a bit of a sweat with it half zipped. It has 2 exterior pockets and 2 internal pockets. Personally I wouldn't put too much in these, as I can really feel the thing stretch and drag down. Just gloves, hat, phone etc. should be fine, nothing like a can of soda or something. Water resistance is what you expect for thin nylon stuff, a few drops is fine,  actual rain, get an umbrella or an actual waterproof layer. It's also pretty windproof, took it out in the aftermath of a pseudo hurricane and didn't feel the wind.It packs down pretty well into a 6 inch long 3 inch or so bundle but nothing like the high tech hiking stuff, I just wish there was a shorter loop so I can carabiner it to my pack easier but seems like it was intended to be carried like an umbrella. Also wish it packed into itself rather than have a bag which may get lost one day.  The material imo isn't very durable, I have no rips yet, but I'm not confident and think if I rub on something the wrong way it's going to tear. The stitching seems fine so far, and doesn't seem to be leaking filler yet.Sizing wise, I have a 45 chest and usually wear XL, but this is kinda big even for an XL, maybe because they were antiicpating you layer something like a thick sweater underneath. It is also a bit long for my torso, about 2-3 inches more than I need to sit at my waist. I have 23 sleeves and that fits perfect.I don't expect this to last a long time, but it's useful for the time I'll have it."
Mike,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",Great item!,"While length and chest fit perfectly the shoulders are a little tight nothing too bad, mostly because I have broad shoulders. A Double XL would be way too big for me so I have to live with X-large that being said I really like this puffer jacket it's amazingly warm has deep pockets on both sides and has an inside storage area on both sides of the jacket. The outside pockets zip up so nothing will fall out of those pockets. An added bonus for me is that it is a camouflage jacket so Its good to wear when trying to take photos of wildlife. It comes with an included bag which the jacket can fit into but I like this jacket so much I doubt I will use the included bag.Summary: For less than $22 you can NOT go wrong with this jacket. Well, worth buying and wearing on a regular basis during the cold winter months."
Robert Ahrens,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 21, 2022",Really Nice for the Money,"Fall is heading towards winter here in southeast Michigan.  I bought this coat to wear on those evenings when it's around freezing and spitting rain, but not yet cold enough to demand my ""real"" winter coat.Overall, the jacket looks really nice.  It's very lightweight.  I love the color (fits with my local sports team) and the zipper works well (often an issue for cheaper products).  I'm not convinced durability will be all that good, but given the price I'm not that concerned about it.  I've had jackets three times this expensive which only lasted a few winters, so I'm willing to experiment with this.I've been wearing this with a hoody or long-sleeved tee underneath at around freezing and it feels nice and warm.  On days when it's in the forties I've worn it with just a short sleeve tee while going for a walk and it feels good.  Water resistance seems good in light rain and snow, but I haven't gone out in soaking rain yet.  Once it hits 20F and below I'd probably go to a thicker coat."
peter gagnon,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 2, 2022",Decent quality for the price,"I was looking for a jacket that wasn't too heavy as I live in the south.  This one is warm without being too heavy.  It also came with a stuff bag so you can easily pack and travel with it.  I purchased the large size as I've found that some Amazon clothing items tend to run small.  For the price paid, this jacket was a great addition to my wardrobe.  I would recommend you buy the size you normally wear.  It seems pretty true to size."
MJBG666,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 11, 2022",Packaging Was Poor,"This jacket seems fine. It's very light and whatever ""filling"" is used, it's minimal to the point of feeling insubstantial. The packaging, however, was poor. The jacket was lying on top of the plastic bag it should have been inside of. It also was so full of static it needed to be treated in the dryer with fabric sheets before it could be worn."
PHP,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022",Keeps warm for >60F. Fits well. Water splash resistance. Very light weight.,"- For me: It keeps me warms if temperature is around 60F. If temperature is below 60F, I had to add a warm sweater in addition to this jacket.- It's light weight- it's water splash resistance like advertised.  It's not water proof like rain coats or jackets.  It can stand light rain.- there are 4 pockets (2 external with zippers and 2 internal).  Nice.- I'm 5'3"" and 125 lbs., and size X-small fits me perfectly."
Gary Moos,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022",Great for the money- not down but should be washable.,This is a light weight winter jacket perfect for layering.I pair it with fleece and polyester thermal undershirt for long winter walks in sub freezing temps with a stiff wind off the river. I bought it to replace my lightweight down because it should hold up to repeated washings.

Shawshank,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 5, 2022",Philmont Approved!!!!,"I purchased two of these jackets as a lightweight backpackable jacket for our 12-day Philmon trek in the Sangre Cristo mountains of Northern New Mexico.  During our trek, we had 2.5 days of rain in altitudes over 9,000 feet.  The lowest temps were mid to high 40's, windy and wet!  These jackets did an outstanding job of keeping us both dry and warm.  In fact, during one particularly heavy rain, I discovered my old Army ACU wet weather top was in fact no longer waterproof.  I pulled off the top and this jacket which I had underneath my wet weather top was soaked in the front, back, and arms.  However that moisture/wetness never touched my skin.  This jacket also served as part of my pillow setup and in spite of the exterior being wet, and in the absence of NNM's low humidity, the jacket dried quickly, and I was able to use it as my pillow.  I would without hesitation recommend, and purchase these jackets again.  When I say ""Philmont Approved"", just know that means more than someone's opinion after taking it out of the package and posing in front of a mirror.  To recap the benefits:1)  Lightweight:  The jacket packs easily into the included bag and was attached to a carabiner on the outside of my backpack. It stayed secure through bushwhacking trails, hiking through trees that tried to grab everything, and scaling up and down some steep mountainsides.  My son kept his bag attached to the loop in the jacket and that worked very well for him.2)  Water resistant:  We both wore these during a few days of sprinkling rain and 2.5 days of legit rain- rain.  Water never breached the inside of the jacket and made contact with our skin.  That is a win!3)  Warm:  This jacket kept us warm in the very cool mountain air of Northern New Mexico, both dry and wet weather.  I'm not going to tell you that this jacket will keep you warm in freezing temps because we did not encounter that kind of weather.  But I will tell you that when it was in the mid  40's and my sleeping bag zipper was broken, and I was quite cold, I put this jacket on (and lost part of my pillow) but was warm and toasty!4)  Quality:  The zippers work great.  Zippered external pockets were a huge plus to reduce the chance of important things (like snacks or other small doodads that I used) from falling out and being lost.  The deep interior pockets were great for holding my phone (for pictures).  The only issue I had was that I tore the loop out.  It was dark and I was having a hard time getting the bag unknotted and broke the loop by force.  It wasn't a failure on the jacket - it was a failure on my patience!5)  Dries quickly:  After it got wet underneath my ""notta wet weather top"" it dried quickly and was able to fulfill it's purpose as part of my pillow setup.Summary:  This is a solid choice for a lightweight outer shell for cooler weather, and will work even if there is some rain in the forecast.  It is lightweight and breathable enough to work as a sub-layer if you have a lightweight rain jacket to help break the wind.  I did not notice the wind getting through this jacket, so I believe it serves well in that regard.  Also, if it survived my teenage Scout and all his rambunctious rock climbing and goofing around, then it should serve you well.  I purchased the Dark Olive Green because it's similar to the Ranger Green clothes I wear for Boy Scouts, and my son purchased the Light Brown because he likes that color.  Both colors look good.  The Light Brown is similar to Coyote Brown, but a little darker.  The OG version was also cheaper at the time of purchase."
Kevin Jata,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",Excellent value,"I was looking for something to bridge the gap btw my fleece hoodie and heavy down coat. This fits the bill. Great insulation to weight ratio, ridiculously light. Doesn't inhibit arm movement at all. Throw a fleece hoodie underneath and you are good into the mid 30's (that is, without a wind factor).  The zipper is not heavy duty, so be delicate with it. Make sure you seat the key of the zipper in the base all the way, and make sure material is stretched out, so the zipper doesn't bind on it.  I'm 170 lbs, 5'10"", I usually get a large, but I got XL so I'd have room for under layers. It was perfect, not clown size big, just enough to be roomy. Cheers!"
Jun T.,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 2, 2022",Can't go wrong with this jacket,"I bought this jacket to keep in my car just in case the weather turned cooler unexpectedly.  It is a good fall to early winter jacket (for California), but would be a little thin for really cold weather.The jacket itself looks great and fit was just about perfect.  For reference, I am 5'10"" 175 lbs and it sits just at my lower waist.The bag to store it in is attached on the inside and is very convenient, since I would probably lose it if it wasn't connected.For the price, it is a great buy and I find myself wearing it more often than my more expensive thicker jackets.  My wife even borrowed it on a cool day and wanted the woman's version.  Perfect for a stocking stuffer gift for her!"
Mudskipper,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 23, 2022",Great value for a medium duty cold weather coat. Specific size info in review,"I’m 6’ and 220 lbs, thick neck and wide shoulders, and barrel-chested. I went with the XL, for the purposes of layering underneath with a fleece vest or jacket. Fit on me with such layering is absolutely PERFECT.If you’re of similar height but a thinner build, or the same build but do NOT plan on layering, the L size will probably suffice. I needed a bit of extra room for layering and making “dead air” space for warmth.Jacket stops about 3” below belt-line, which is perfect for this type of coat. Sleeve length is perfect as well.I’d say this jacket is probably ideal all by itself for temps in the 40’s-60’s with just a shirt underneath, maybe into the 30’s or even high 20’s if you’re doing something active like exercise, vigorous walking/hiking or strenuous work. If you plan on using it in colder temps for less-active stuff (lots of standing around, etc) then layer it underneath with something else, and it should probably be ok into the high-teens to 20’s for most cold-acclimated people.It is NOT of sufficient length to conceal a typical pistol carried in a standard outside-the-waistband type holster. The bottom of the holster will be visible below the bottom of the jacket.This jacket is NOT water-resistant by design, BUT you can spray treat it with a product like Kiwi Camp-Dry or similar water-shedding spray for very good water repellent properties for light rain conditions or all types of snow/ice.It’s also great in that it packs/folds up/stuffs into its’ own small stuff-sack (included), making it a good choice for a travel coat for chilly weather that doesn’t take up a lot of space.The only thing I would change about this jacket is adding a draw cord around the bottom to tighten up the fit at the waist. Other than that, it’s perfect."
Amazon Customer,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 27, 2022",Lightweight and well made,"Husband is 5'8"" and weighs 185. Medium fits perfectly if not a little tight around his midsection when zipped. He is athletic and barrel chested. Lifts weights so shoulders are somewhat developed. If he were to wear a heavy sweater or hoodie he would need to get a large but it would probably be too long in the torso and sleeves. It is nicely snug with a lightweight tee shirt abd zipped. For our purposes in northern California  mountains it's perfect as husband is the shirts and flips in the winter guy even in 50 degree weather."

It is light but feels very warm...will be fabulous with a 'hoodie' under it. the fit is great. I ordered a men's size as the sleeves are usually longer...and I am very tall...I was not disappointed.

NOnononononoNoNO,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 6, 2020",HOW TO DISTINGUISH REAL FROM FAKE,"Alright, since there is an incredible problem with ordering this specific item from Amazon, I will tell you what to look for when you receive your item to distinguish the deceptively convincing fakes from the authentic, legendarily *L I F E S A V I N G* Carhartt's. I live 15 minutes from the world headquarters, I know exactly how this item should function and have purchased a minimum of thirty of these over my lifetime for friends, family, and myself. You must first understand that there are three distinct factories which produce this product. The first are licensed factories in Kentucky, the second in Canada, and the third in China. The tagging of Chinese origin is not a valid reason to distinguish fake from real, as they abide by the same standard of rib stitching and acrylic quality. The second understanding is dimensional, the watch hat has an extremely specific length to width to height ratio. Finally, and most importantly, the third understanding is that the fakes from China are produced for a specific reason; they can match with convincing accuracy both the logo and the tear-able internal tag, however they cannot yet match a licensed Carhartt's quality to price ratio because of some import laws. They must sacrifice on a specific quality (the density and quality of the stitching) in order to both compete, yet remain convincing enough to still sell online.  In order to tell if your hat is truly authentic, you must verify that the brim measures 4 inches tall, the overall height 9 inches, and the brim width 8 and 1/2 inches when laid flat. Secondly, take the brim and hold it above a significant light source while stretching it between your fingers. You should feel SIGNIFICANT elastic resistance and strength in constructional constitution. - - -If light passes easily through and you can see that the internal stitching is loose like a sock, you have a fake. There is no arguing this fact, some are closer than others but none of them are as tight, dense, or BULLETPROOF as a true watch hat. If, when stretching, there is even a hint that the hat would rip if you were using it to hang off a cliff you have a F A K E. It gets cold up here in Michigan, we need these things to not die, so forgive me if I sound a little angry; I am. - - - If light BARELY passes through, with only very small pinholes of light peaking through, you have a genuine product. I have also noticed that the store ""EZ Sportswear"" consistently sells these fakes, they all say made in Canada so I suspect there is some sort of import law they can skirt and flip these bogus beanies. Seeing that it is sold by Amazon directly is not enough evidence to certify these either, I have received numerous fakes directly from Amazon. Another significant clue is that stock for these is almost always moving, there is very little dead stock on this specific item: therefore you can check Carhartt's main website and take note of which colors they offer. If you see fantastic colors only on Amazon you have another clue (this does not discredit the older heather patterns that are still available on here, I am specifically referring to colors like Peach and Winter white that looks flat white instead of the beige it should be). So there you have it, now stop arguing because I have received so many fakes from this website I won't even bother use it anymore. It's also hilariously insulting they might try to sell the women's winter white for $45 when the legitimate men's (the only size it comes in, one) is ~$14. So... watch out people, the probability is high you will be unknowingly swindled. It's really annoying planning on presents that include this hat and receiving a fake 70% of the time."

Clueless in Seattle,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 11, 2021","Made in China, not in Canada like my old one","I've had a couple of Carhartt Men's Acrylic Watch Hats A18, Brite Lime  for a number of years, and when I lost one, I ordered a couple more from amazon to keep on hand as spares.Well the other day my usual hat hadn't  fully dried after laundering, so I opened the package of one of my spare hats, and was deeply disappointed.  The fabric of the new hat is completely different from my old hat.  It stretches way too much and doesn't keep its shape.  The weave  of the old had is thicker and more substantial; has more heft.  The new hat feels flimsy and cheesy.These new hats are unwearable.  So I checked the label and found that the old hat was made in Canada whereas the new hats were made in China.What am I to do with these unusable hats?  I'm sure they are not  returnable to amazon, because so much time has passed since I ordered them.  I wondered if Carhartt would take them back, so I went to their ""Contact Us"" page and filled out a form.

Redpawn3,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 23, 2022","Smaller than desired on large, big, larger, bigger head","This Carhartt Men's Knit Cuffed Beanie seems to be quality made. If you know a lot about beanies then cool. For those that don’t it feels typical for a knit. It wears comfortably with the food/roll. Except it is ONE SIZE fits ‘most’.I do have a large or bigger than ‘average’ sized head. And having read the reviews was optimistic and gave this a chance.My personal preferences are that this hat is close to what I want, but too small. It’s potentially adequate for a large head (bigger head) IF you don’t mind pulling it down constantly. Or IF you don’t mind unrolling it (leaving a single layer to cover your upper ears.)My experience- basic head turning causes the hat to slowly creepy up and expose the lower portion of ear lobes. Intense shoveling or activity makes the hat creepy up a lot faster.I feel like the hat could be maybe a centimeter or two bigger and then I’d be content.I will keep this hat, and plenty of people in the family could wear it quite comfortably, but for me and my larger/bigger sized head it falls short of contentment.This is a quality hat, but I just want to give a personal perspective on the larger head bigger head reviews. I respectfully disagree that bigger heads or larger sized heads will find this hat meets their needs."

David Castro,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 11, 2022",Fits just fine and streches enough to covered my ears.,So far it fiesta my needs.
Drea,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022",Best beanie!,"I want to start by saying this beanie is NOT tight like some other reviewers said. I purchased these for my kids and was weary after reading other reviews says that it fits like the youth size. I 💯 disagree with those reviews, it’s much larger and looser, it fits my normal sized head and my husbands small head. It doesn’t leave lines in my forehead and the extra material on the top of the head is not much when pulled over your ears. At $15 you can’t go wrong. Purchased 2 and will order more."
Tabby Katt,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",Little brother loves it!,"Kids hats no longer fit, so we were searching for a new winter hat. This one is great quality, fits perfectly, and we LOVE the color! It's just as pictured, and luckily matches the new winter jacket we got him! At first I thought the cost seemed a bit much, because it is name brand, but I wanted to splurge a little. After receiving the item I can say it is worth it. It's well made, warm, and it seems like it was made to last. One of the best quality hats I've come across yet! I'm happy with my purchase :)"
KccaseyK,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 31, 2015",Very comfortable and warm. Extra length to provide a nice cuff over the ears.,"This is my 2nd purchase of this hat, however, I will tell you why at the end of my review, since this this is supposed to be a review for the item itself and not necessarily just about why I purchased the hat.This Hat would actually be a great warm winter Hat for those SD, ND, MN, WI, NY, PA, etc Type winters.As a Man, this is a great winter Hat that fits great and as expected. It actually exceeded my expectations, especially for the fit and wear & tear you will put it through, as it is a Carhartt. Carhartt means, it was made to be USED and not just worn.  Any man will know the difference between wearing something and actually using it.I have about a Medium size to slightly medium-large sized head. Medium because of the shape and size of my head is Medium like anyone else with a medium sized head.  However, the large part is because the vertical length of my head is slightly longer.  Kind of like your shoe size may really be a size 10, however because you may have wide feet you have to get a size 11 just to accommodate the width, if a size 10W isn't available.If you're looking for a Medium sized hat with a little bit of length to it, then this would be the hat to get.Realistically, the hat is slightly a little bigger because of the length and its new.  However for a Man, it's always good to purchase a hat that is slightly bigger than what you presumably need, because you never know what your going to be stuck doing, like a lot of shoveling or out scraping cars when it's ice cold out and you need that extra part/length of the hat to cuff and cover your ears really well to keep them warm and protected.If you put this hat on all the way w/o cuffing it, and wear/pull it all the way down until there is no more to material to pull down, it will reach to about the base of the head/neck, with still a little slack left over.In terms of long term use and durability, this is also another reason why I love this hat.  As it does have slightly a little extra slack to it.  Depending on your purpose, occupation or whatever the heck you'll be doing that you'll be wearing this hat, it can be adjusted in many different positions.You'll also more than likely you'll end up putting it in the wash.  When you wash this hat, I highly recommend washing it only with other winter type articles of clothing, or maybe a small load of shirts or sweaters at most.  Yes, you could wash it with just a regular full load of laundry or anything else, but I don't recommend it if you want this hat to last a long time. Like anything else in this life, If you take care of it, it will take care of you. The best way to dry it would either be to throw it in the dryer for 5 minutes at the most and let it hang dry. However, if you want to dry it in the dryer all the way, put it on very light heat for about 10 to 15 minutes, or just let the dryer run on air dry with no heat for about 20 to 30 minutes. If you drive too much, that will get more worn Out and used then if you were wearing and using it yourself, which means it won't last long.This is my 2nd year purchasing this exact hat, as I still have the 1st hat from last year.  Except this time/year, I purchased 2 more from Amazon.The 1st hat was purchased at a retail location.  Then I found it online at Amazon for a fraction of the price.  I was hesitant at 1st, because the price on Amazon was substantially lower.  However, when I received these from Amazon, upon further examination, it was the same exact one that I purchased at retail.I purchased additonally hats because I have a habit of losing them. When you find a product or item that works well, especially a winter hat, it's a good idea to purchase a few extra ones.If you lose the only one that you have or if you've really got some really good use out of the one that you have had for a long time and you know it's more than likely it's time for you to throw it out, you know it's going to be close to impossible to find another one again that works exactly like the one that you had and grown accustom to that you know that works. We all know that all good things come to an end  it don't last forever. Then before you know it, your stuck having to go from store to store (site-to-site) to try to find a hat that fits or is comfortable, especially in the middle of winter when you just lost your hat. To top it off, you can no longer find that same exact hat. I've been through that before and it sucks.So in closing this is a very good hat, because of the good comfortable fit, durability, longevity and that It will take good care of you; and especially for the price.  You can't beat the price for the brand that you're getting which also makes it easier to buy extra hats.If you're going to buy extra hats, I recommend buying at least 2 or 3 extra or total of 3 or 4 hats. 1 hat for obvious reasons; an extra 1 at home in case you lose 1, 1 extra one for in your car under your seat in case you forget your hat or lose it while you're out and abou, that way you have an extra one in the car when you need it.  Also, 1 hat left at work.  The extra hats in the car or at work also serve a great purpose for helping somebody else out that may not have a hat that clearly needs one."
Steffani,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 8, 2022",Always can rely on Carhartt,Bought this for my husband for when it's cold. He always relies on Carhartt products when it comes to workwear so it only made sense to get the hat. He's bald so in the winter it can get cold for him. I tried it on myself and thought wow this really is great quality. Fit him and I perfect. Soft and stretchy.  Definitely recommend and worth the price!
M,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 19, 2022",Men’s… pifft,"As a fairly small-headed woman, this thing is awesome! I love it. I love that it’s a little big because I can fold the back down and up under my bun to keep the hair off my neck. The color is really nice, too. The material could be softer, but it’s not itchy. It’s also pretty easy to clean or peel grass/hay/straw from. I wear it all the time, it covers my ears and keeps my head warm. It’s not as toasty as my Columbia hat with the silver omni heat foil stuff (ultimate hat!), but it’s a solid farm hat. I don’t worry about getting it dirty or washing it, unlike my fancy hat. I’ll probably buy ones for my husband and children."
Vidadetei,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 27, 2022",Smurf who ? Leave that itch behind,I have super sensitive skin and as a female no one hates a breakout on their forehead. I don’t need a giant billboard from my beanie saying hey look at puss filled rash. Well most beanies ends up causing an itchy rash or clogged pores. This one does not. So soft so comfy not a huge Smurf look to it. Have this same one in multiple colors. Highly recommended
Reza K.,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 2, 2022",Comfortable and warm,"I bought this in black. I was worried since I have a big head that it might be tight but it is very comfortable. Also, my head gets super itchy with beanies on, but this one feels nice and isn’t itchy."
Rodrigo Abello,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022",Perfect size,"It fits great. Very soft. Wife now does not want to take it off (basically I lost it to her), now ought to buy my own."
Joseph,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 3, 2022",Highly visible,I have several other Carhartt sock hats and have liked them all. They keep my head warm and never feel tight but don't fall off. This particular blaze orange hat kept me from being mistaken as a target! It'll last years.
Computer Guru,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 13, 2022",Very High Quality,"Great material, color and quality. I own a lot of Carhartt and this one lives up to the expectation. I definitely recommend this hat."
D,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 26, 2022",Baby cuffs? Bad quality,"I got this to add to a cozy gift basket so unfortunately don't have time to return it and get a new one, but something went horribly wrong in the construction of this sweatshirt. On the size large, one of the cuffs is kind of close to a normal size cuff, but still extremely tight. Like, 'will trigger your claustrophobia' tight. The other cuff is maybe an inch in diameter? Yes, diameter, not radius. I don't know whose baby needs a size large sweatshirt, but I've got one for them. The sweatshirt is also super thin and has threads coming out of the arm seams, not pictured. Save your time and buy from the brand that rhymes with Mildan for the same price, I've always had amazing, fantastic quality items from them."
Cruisinsoon,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 11, 2022","Same ID Number, but Not the Same Shirt!!!","We are so disappointed in Hanes.  The inconsistency is inexcusable.  We purchased this sweatshirt a year or so ago and it was perfect:  great fabric and feel, great fit, tagless.  So we reorder the same thing.  This second sweatshirt is nowhere near what the original sweatshirt was.  The fit is like a bag.  The band around the bottom is wider than the shirt, so it just hangs instead of being able to blouse it.  The neck hangs loose.  The fabric is thinner.  It is NOT tagless like the original was.  I checked the RN number to make sure we reordered the same shirt.  The RN number is exactly the same.  (By the way, the first shirt was made in Honduras and the second shirt was made in Salvador.)  The inconsistencies are unacceptable.  Sorry Hanes, this is going back."
LL,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 11, 2022",Quality Went Downhill,"I purchased a black sweatshirt a while back and decided to get the same one with a different color. The arm length was about 3 inches shorter than my original one. They are both medium, but this new one was made in Honduras. The material also felt much thinner and subpar. I returned it and will not be buying any more of this product."
Jelp,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 3, 2022",BE CAUTIOUS READ REVIEW,"This was everything I wanted in terms of fit, warmth, and softness. BUT after this fabric warms up (eg when you've had it on for a while) it starts to emit a chemical-like odor. I wore it to bed and ended up having to strip all the linens and wash them to get the odor out."
Clarence70,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 30, 2022",Horrible quality!!!!!,This shirt is not like your typical crew neck shirt. It it’s veryyyyyyy thin almost see through and mine had strings/ threads hanging off of it it everywhere where it was falling apart the seems. It isn’t your fleece like on the inside either like most crew necks. It is rough and pill-y. It is not fitted at the waist where the elastic would normally grip at your waist it is just loose and unattractive! Do not recommend.
Q,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 5, 2022",Save your money do not buy this poo!!!!,I ordered 3 sweatshirts and they all are short to the waistline. I washed in cold when I got them and low heat to dry them. The over all fit and materials used are poor at best. Atleast they are good for oil change rags!!!
Melody Johnson,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 30, 2022",Looks very cheap,"The way it’s pieced together; color not at all tasteful; very large; must send back… would not give as gift. Yes, I know it is not Nordstroms and yet, have had better from this brand."
cory thomas,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 20, 2022",Bad don’t buy,This sweatshirt is extremely thin and cheap feeling. I ordered a 5xl because I am tall. The product is extremely wide and extremely short. Material is terrible. Very very thin almost like a long sleeve tshirt material
Amazon Customer,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 10, 2020",This did not even cover my behind when a 4xl t-shirt does,"I wear a 4xl heavy weight t-shirt I am a big person 270 or so and 5 foot 4 inches tall.  My t-shirts (4xl) fall below my behind have lots of room in the sleeves and neck and roomie throughout the rest of the shirt.  I bought a 5xl heavy weight material t-shirt and the legth came to the middle of my thigh plenty long.So when I saw the Hanes 5xl sweat shirt I assumed that this would fit like there 5xl t-shirt and be nice and long.This sweat shirt doesn't even cover my behind  the neck hole is tight the length of the sleeves are really the only thing I like about the sweat shirt  nice and long. ALSO this is not your typical type of sweatshirt material or weight  Very light weight material  and don't think this would keep you very warm on a cold day.Im very disappointed in the length especially thought this would at least hang down to the middle of my thigh.  So for those who like a long shirt and who are the size I pointed out at the beginning of this review this is not the product you should order.  I will be returning it  really too bad don't know whats up with the size OH the Width of this sweat shirt fits is roomie but could fit a little looser as well. ALSO there was no ""tagless tag"" on this sweat shirt either  nice long tag hanging from the inside back collar.  What's up with that ?"
Lin M,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 18, 2022",Beware!,Left sleeve almost sewn shut! I bought this for someone who just tried to wear it yesterday and found the sleeve was sewn incorrectly and could not get her arm through. Unfortunately it is 1 day passed the return date. Now it is a piece of garbage. Never had this happen with anything purchased through Amazon before. Buyer beware.
Cosmowomen,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 18, 2022",Not what I expected and a lot of pilling,I thought this was going to be great I got a white sweatshirt for $11 plus tax basically and I tried it on and it fit. But I’m 5‘9“ tall so it’s not going to go over your butt like I thought it would if you wanted to wear leggings with it. But I thought OK no biggie I just will use it as a night sweatshirt but I immediately washed it because I’m just one of those type of people before I actually would wear it but I didn’t put it in the dryer but the amount of pilling was crazy and it was everywhere all over my other clothes whites in the wash machine and I know how to wash clothes so I know it wasn’t that. Sucks because I would have probably bought another one and maybe a bigger size to see if it would go over my butt and be a little bit longer so I could wear it out of the house w-leggings but I will never buy a sweatshirt like this ever again! To me after I got it out of the wash machine and dried it and then had to clean my wash machine and everything I just kind of felt like I had bought this from a outlet mall/cheap and I hate to even say that because you can find a lot of good stuff at outlet malls but there was something wrong with it that’s why it was that way and I don’t put anything in the dryer hardly ever because I’m so tall but this was just so bad it irritates me when I even wear it around the house because of the pilling like it I feel like it’s getting up my nose and in my hair on my face I hate it and I washed it so I can’t return it it’s a no buy for me do you not buy if you care about any of these things
J. Dahlstrom,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 30, 2022",This shrunk a lot!,"First, the length is short.  Most manufacturers of big & tall clothes seem to think the majority of large men are 5'5"", or so.  I'm 6 foot tall and before being washed this barely came to my waist.  After being washed this is unwearable.  For the price it was worth a shot, I guess."

It's fairly soft on the inside (no covered seams though) and the size is as expected.However, I was not expecting that in the year 2022, sweatshirts are still made with horrible scratchy tags that are intended to be ripped out. It's not a horrible problem since it was easy to rip out, but now without the tag or any type of printed label, it's kind of hard to quickly tell the back/front apart and I end up putting it on backwards half the time before noticing that the neck is too high in front. Could be easily solved by doing the normal thing and printing a tagless label, or putting in a smooth tag."

Thinking that I may have bought them at Walmart, I contacted Fruit of the Loom directly to complain how the socks would easily slip off my feet while wearing them. I had an older pair of the Fruit of the Loom socks that I purchased last year and sent them a picture of the socks to compare the difference with the newer ones. (See attached image)At first, the lady who answers the phone at the company seemed to care, and offered to send me a new pack, but I refused to accept them if they were made the same way as the one's that I was unhappy with.  The lady at Fruit of the Loom has never returned my call or responded in any way to the pictures that I sent to their company which tells me that Fruit of the Loom just doesn't give a hoot or care about who buys they're product!I WILL BE RELEASING A YOUTUBE VIDEO FOR FREE TO ANY YT CHANNEL SO AS TO MAKE PEOPLE AWARE OF NOT ONLY MY STORY BUT TO ALSO LET PEOPLE KNOW HOW THIS COMPANY IS RIPPING PEOPLE OFF!Lastly, I don't know if this Amazon seller is selling irregulars on Amazon, but if they are, THEY SHOULD WARN BUYERS!"
Jeremy,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 11, 2022",NOT ANKLE SOCKS...  THESE ARE NO SHOW SOCKS,"This ad doesn't tell you anything about whether these are ankle or no show socks.  The pictures make it look as though they are ankle socks.  So I ordered them.Socks are extremely thin.  They look like you could wear them once before throwing them in the trash.I'd recommend running down to your local Wal-Mart and picking up a higher quality pair of socks for less money.Pretty disappointed in the quality of this product.  It is getting returned!Amazon.... this is a great way to get people to stop doing business with you.  This is sold by amazon.  First, take the time to only use photos of the product you are advertising instead of putting a dozen different pictures of different styles of socks that confuse customers.  Second..... It looks like they went out of there way to get the cheapest materials to make the thinnest, lowest quality product on the planet.  Really disappointed at how bad this product is."
Tracy Wright,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 6, 2022",Horrible,"They kept slipping off of my heal, made my feet sweat a lot, and they smelled horrible after wearing. My feet don’t normally stink. I had to throw them away."
Amazon Customer,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",Wears out super fast,These socks don’t last long at all. Got holes in them pretty much immediately. I would never buy this again or recommend to any one
Mike,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022",very uncomfortable,The socks shift inside my shoe or boot when i'm walking creating a very uncomfortable situation.
Rob,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 12, 2022",These are like nylon and don't stay on your feet,"I thought these would be more cotton like but they are like thin nylon, like dress socks. As soon as you start walking, these things slide down off your heel and work their way to your arch in an uncomfortable bunch. It's not the shoe as they do the same thing with my other pair of shoes. They are unusable."
Jeff S.,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 24, 2022",Not what is advertised.,Ordered these expecting them to be ankle high and instead they are no-show. No where in the description does it say no-show. One would think you should not have to read reviews on something as basic as socks. Spent 15 seconds reading reviews after getting wrong product to see it is common to get product that is not advertised.
Koopher429,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 6, 2022",All ripped after second wash,The grey toe separate from the black very quickly. Every-single-pair has at least one hole.
Lee,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 1, 2022",Came with a hole already,"One of the socks came with a hole near the toe. The black material and the grey material seem like they weren't overlapping when the sock was made, so there's a gap/hole there. It's not worth the hassle of going through the return process for one sock though."
Jeff Ortiz,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 28, 2022",Terrible,Socks fall under heel constantly. Wish I could get a refund. Not happy at all
JasBro,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 30, 2022",Don't Cut the Mustard!,"While they appear to be nice socks, they are not great.  First, they are too loose.  Second, they slip off the heel too easy.  Thirds, you can feel the stitching in the toes.  It had been a while since I bought Fruit-of-the-Loom and now I know why.Here is how they work with the various shoe types:Sneaker:  Slip off the heel in about 500 steps or less.Casual Loafer:  Slip off the heel in about 150 steps.If I am going to be stopping to reposition the socks I am wearing every 1-2 minutes, it makes the sock worthless.  Look elsewhere if you want a well fitted, non-slip sock.  These don't cut the mustard!"
Peter C Mead,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 4, 2022",Designed to make poor people’s feet stink.,It’s been a million years since I went with this brand. They’re not the bargain they appear to be. The fabric is so thin that heat and moisture don’t absorb and just build up in your shoe. Think cheap dress socks thin. I’ve never had foot odor until using these. You get what you pay for I guess.
R. Scott,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 9, 2022",Not Durable,"I where these socks with Crocs. They are thin to start with. Purchased in February and currently down to my last pair as of September. I only walk in them and not much at that, mostly sitting.I would not recommend these socks."
Amazon Customer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 6, 2022",Product description is a lie,"The socks are perfectly fine, but there are only 12 socks, not 12 pairs. The description says twice as many socks come as do"
beeman,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 13, 2022",Not what is displayed advertised.,The fit is more 6.5 to 10 at best but not up to 12.  The displayed picture shows as an above the ankle but the actually fit is a no show for my 11 1/2 foot. The socks are actually no show the more I look at them. Can't trust Fruit of The Loom advertising.
Michelle,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 13, 2022",No show socks,The pictures make it look like these are ankle socks but there's a tiny product detail section at the bottom of the listing stating they are no show socks. Of course it's not mentioned in the main description at the top of the page. Usually I'm pretty good at catching things like this but missed it this time. Unfortunately I didn't notice my mistake until after I washed them & husband tried them on so I can't return. BEWARE & don't make the same mistake.
Lisa Mensch,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 31, 2022",NOT CUSHIONED ENOUGH,THESE WERE DESCRIBED AS CUSHIONED SOCKS.  THEY ARE NOT CUSHIONED AT ALL.  THEY ARE REGULAR MENS LOW RISE SOCKS. DISAPPOINTED
Mike,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 30, 2022",Thin.,Socks are very thin. If you are on your feet alot like me. Look elsewhere. If you want a lounging sock for the house. Ok. Also smaller than you think.
T. Goff,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 15, 2022",The photo is not accurate,"What I expected from ""ankle"" socks, is what the picture represented, which are socks that come up to my ankles. What I got are socks that barely come to the top of the shoes."
Brian,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 22, 2022",poor quality,largest socks within range. toes are abnormally fitted. these socks were made by a person that's learning to sew. very poor quality from such a big company
vmck,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 30, 2022",Kinda Small,"These are nice, but only average foot size. I don't think they would fit the larger sizes. They person I gave these has a average foot and they barely fit."
KP,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 5, 2022",Comfortable but don't stay on,I love these socks except they are by my toes if I have to do any amount of walking. They are comfortable.
Gregory Kudzin,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 2, 2022","Comfortable sock, bad design flaw",Really comfortable but after 1-2 months of use the sock just fell apart. It has happened with multiple pairs in which the end of the sock just breaks and the stitching comes apart. I ordered a replacement and it also has happened with the replacement socks. Other than that they're very comfortable but it's a clear design flaw.
Carlos Rivero,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 13, 2022",Just ok and nothing else,"I love this brand but with these socks I am not satisfied, the material is rough and also fits a little too large. I already washed a few times and don't look very durable, so I will have to buy more again. They are just ok, but I expected something better..."
SirFixalot,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 20, 2022",Good socks for work,"I like these for work , they are definitely not the softest or most comfortable but they are good enough for work shoes and boots , I toss them after a few months and get new"

Vanessa Martin,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 29, 2022",Not ankle socks,"They’re fine socks, but they’re not ankle socks as labeled. They’re no-show socks that stop below the ankle."
Rob B.,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 11, 2022",The thickness,There a little  thin
sean harold,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 7, 2022",Simultaneously too big and too small,"The big issues with these socks are:1. The ""no show"" aspect is exaggerated to the point where the socks offer almost no heel protection at all. Chafing is almost guaranteed.2. Even though these are listed as sizes 6-12, they're too big everywhere except the heel (I'm a size 10.5-11, so I should be at the snug end of the spectrum, instead these socks are borderline floppy).Bad fit all around."
Edward,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 16, 2022",Make my feet sweet,Fell ok just making my feet stink. Wasn't like that until I put these socks on.
Jon H.,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 6, 2022",Almost perfect,"They are well made and comfortable. Runs a little big though. I wear a 10.5 shoe and these are almost too big. If I pull them on snugly, the heal will stretch too far."
T. K. Sneed,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 5, 2022",Just a bit thin.,"The socks fit great, but I walk a lot and these are thinner than a set of these I purchased in the past. Not sure if I missed a description or if they're just thinner now."
Mike Mantione,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 11, 2022",Very thin,By looking at the picture they look thicker. Very thin compared to what I usually wear. Will see how they hold up.
Lori Jackson,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 27, 2022",Nice socks,"Good value,wear well"
Robert & Linda Sapien,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 22, 2022",This sock is soft but lgi,I like the style and bargain.  Don't like the size and way it fits.  This sock is pretty much a no-show sock. The picture really doesn't show the right length.  The sock runs big.

Helena,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 25, 2022",No Shows,"I normally read the comments, but this time I didn't. Amazon pictures ankle socks, but these are no-shows. Please correct this. Comfortable despite the incorrect stock photo."
Danalynn,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 29, 2022",These are a noshow sock  I thought they were ankle high,"I thought these were just over the ankle socks.  I was wrong, the ones I received were no show  Not sure if it was a mixup or what.  I'm not returning them because my grandson can wear them but I ordered a different brand for my husband. I would have returned them but I had already thrown the packaging away and washed them.  I didn't notice they were too short."
Anonymous,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 6, 2022",Elastic band is a little too small,These socks are extremely comfortable overall and soft. The only problem is that the elastic band in the ankle is small and can be tight on people with larger feet/ankles
Saiful,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 22, 2022",Ok quality,"Quality is ok, on par. But you get so many pairs of socks!"
Melissa,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 8, 2022",Good product,It was on time and was as described. However I didn’t like how it was packaged. It was just in a clear bag and everyone could see what it was. Maybe put it in a box next time or something.
Charles Suval,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022",Better than the bulkier versions,"I never thought I would prefer ""invisible socks until I tried these.  I actually wear them almost all day.  They feel great inside shoes AND they are a prefect replacement for bulkier and hotter slippers!!"
Lito,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 13, 2022",I will buy more of this product,I am very picky about socks because they are either too big or ware out too easily. I like this product
Kelly,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 3, 2022",Great socks,"I’ve had trouble finding durable comfortable socks that fit me, and these are perfect. They’re not too thin, but still breathable. And they fit me perfectly and don’t slip down in my shoe"

Thomas Crescenzi,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 6, 2022",Avoid… tears easily,"I bought one of these a couple of years ago. I really liked it. It's perfect for those days when it's not quite cold enough for a ski jacket, but not warm enough to go out with nothing. Very comfortable. The only thing I didn't like was that the pockets are a little awkwardly placed. However, after a few months, I found the outer flannel layer was torn and the insulation exposed. After a while, the tear just got so big that I decided to buy another one a little over a month ago. Guess what? Same tear, same place. And of course, I'm about a week too late to be able to return it. I have not subjected it to anything that other jackets wouldn't be able to withstand. I actually think the tear is from the seatbelt buckle in my car. If it can't handle even that much, then I can't really recommend it. You're better avoiding this. I'll not be buying another one."
Rick williams,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 3, 2022",Not to Good!,Fits so weirdly. They must have been drunk when they sewed this thing together!

Scott Davis,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 12, 2022",Did not fit,"Sent this coat back for two reasons: 1) too large. I wear xlg in everything. This Xtra large obviously was mislabeled. It was prob a 2xl.  2) cheaply constructed. Poorly constructed, wouldn't have lasted me more than 6 months. Returned."
Jason stong,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 13, 2022",Item was supposed to be light weight it’s quilted inside very warm not what expected,"Product was described as lightweight almost t-shirt like..I own many styles like that, this was very heavy weight and quilted interior more for winter use..I live in florida!

critterlady,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 13, 2021",Runs SMALL and SHRINKS when washed!,"I had to exchange a medium because it was HUGE, to a small and given how much the shirt shrunk when washed, perhaps I should have kept the medium! The small that I'm returning also had a hole in the back so would have unraveled into a bigger hole in a short time. Wrangler used to make a great product, have worn Wrangler jeans all my life but this shirt left a lot to be desired and I will NOT be exchanging the shirt. Wrangler, you should have stayed in America with American workers making your garments!"
 David Roberts,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 26, 2022",Way to small,I got it yesterday and sent it back today.I went with the size that was recommended by the Amazon chart. This thing is nowhere a large. Maybe a child could wear it. Really disappointed with this item.
zarM,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 16, 2022",I ordered the item in small and it came in large size and was late when delivered,I like how it made me feel mad and I dislike how it was large and came in late and the purpose of the jacket is to make me feel small and unworthy 🥲
Amazon Customer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 16, 2022",Runs way too big,The jacket was way too long. The sleeves were the correct length but were not form fitting. I'd recommend this jacket for doing someone intense outdoors (perhaps camping?). My hope was to have something fashionable for a fall photoshoot. This was not it.
Betta ,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",HUGE,I ordered medium but it long asf quality is what youre paying for looks decent
Be Right,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 3, 2022",Way to big on the arms,It’s a winter coat not a flannel jacket it’s comfortable but heavy would not recommend.
Daniel A. Borg,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 19, 2022",Too thin material,Too thin. Hood off center and comes below eyes. Was chilly with just jacket on when temp was in upper 40's. Had to add another sweatshirt underneath.

Andrew,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 8, 2022",Uncomfortable,"The jacket is super puffy and it can get hot in it after a while. The material on the arms make you hot for sure and it’s just an uncomfortable feeling. Out of no where, the bottom of the arm sleeve ripped and I didn’t know that until someone told me. I wouldn’t really reccomend that much. But, some other people may like it."
Bri Barger,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 29, 2022",was massive when i got out of package,had to return because it was so large
C jense,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 25, 2022",Colors are off,"Colors are off. The ""bikers red"" is more of a pinkish red and not true red."
CB,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 26, 2022",Don’t buy it,"Runs bigger than expected, and the sleeves are so wide and puffy. Doesn’t look good at all. I’m 6’2 180 got a large it was huge returned for a medium, and still fit terribly. Returned again"
RDM,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 31, 2022",Not warm.,Not insulated very good.
Spike,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",Comfy but THIN!,"I have other jackets like this one, and I'm kinda disappointed in this Wrangler version. It looks great, and is super comfy, but it is soooo thin. Much thinner than other versions of this style I have seen before. The ""flannel"" plus the lining on this together are thinner than just a standard Wrangler flannel shirt without lining. The extra air between layers on this mean that this might be a tiny bit warmer than an unlined flannel shirt, but not by much. I really wish this shirt/jacket had thicker fabric and was warmer, then it would be perfect."
Brittany M,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 11, 2022",It’s okay,I wasn’t expecting much for the price and you definitely get what you pay for. I was looking for something for my husband and I loved the colors. It definitely is of cheaper quality and won’t last long. Not sure if he will like it or not but it would make a good layering piece.
Doormouse,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 23, 2022",tried twice,"order this in an x large once before, it was way too big and i ordered with black hood it wasn't black. so my sister got an  early Christmas gift, . so i ordered this one in a large, i was happy about it coming on time and i put it on. it's tight, so i looked and it's a medium, not the large i order. the bag says l/g but the tag says m/m. that's the reason for the low score"
Stephanie Ruano-Escareno,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022",The hood was suppose to be black as descripted,"disappointed the hood was not black as it stated it was when i ordered it. i tried it on & i like it with the grey hood. still wish it was black which it said when i ordered! its okay, itll work. it nice warm & comfortable. its nice. first time ever making a review."
A J ,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 8, 2022",Not as warm as it should be.,This is a very lightweight flannel Hoosier but lacks the warmth I had in my old Wrangler Hoodie. Thin insulation for this price. Should have bought a different brand I guess.
Jerrod,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 14, 2022",Not for guy’s with a belly,"There’s a lot to like about this jacket. It looks nice. The material and inner lining were just as I’d hoped.  Unfortunately, I should have gone up a size. I looked at the size chart and purchased the size that matched my chest size. But I should have given thought to my belly, because that’s what did me in. Yeah, I’ve got a bit of a gut, and while I could get the buttons closed, it was tight enough that it wasn’t comfortable.  So if you’re like me, take my advice:  Check the size chart, it’s accurate.  But if you have a belly, go a size bigger.  Even though there are XL sizes, it’s not made for someone with a spare tire."
Mom of two,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 26, 2022",Weird pocket placement,"My husband likes the fit and the pattern, however, he gives it only 3 stars because the pockets are placed too far back. It's like he's reaching behind himself to use the pockets. (He's 6'3"" and of average build)"
M♥️R,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 6, 2022",Needs snap buttons. Runs big. Hood is huge  Only one cuff button,"Fits but hood is huge, sleeves long, only one cuff button,"
KrystalA31,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022",Not the best quality.,Nice jacket.Materiel is lacking aloooot.Arrived quickly.Should be cheaper.
DTV,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 8, 2022",No zipper,"Would be better if it had a zipper, plus it is already pilling up in certain places after only one wash."
Trinity,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 30, 2022",Great to have!,I love this jacket. It is my go to jacket when it is cold outside. I like to wear a hoodie underneath.My only complaints are that I wish it was a bit thicker and had a bit more stretch when it is buttoned up
Olivia Hall,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022",Size,"Bought this and I felt it ran kinda big. It’s nice when it’s super cold though to wear hoodies under. All in all, good product."
Jack,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 15, 2022",Looks ok. Comfortable,Pockets for hands would be nice. But didn’t think about that when I ordered. Fits fine but I ordered one size above normal. Could be longer. But I am a tall so I ordered one size above fit. Still not as long as I would like. Sleeves are plenty long enough.
Lee Finstad,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022",Great product,"Lightweight, warm and comfortable"
Deanna,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 28, 2022",Pretty good!,"Ordered this for my dad for Xmas, thought it would’ve been a little more heavier but this will still be perfect!"

Carina Hernandez,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 21, 2022",Not high quality,Considering the price for this jacket I expected a very good quality item. The material feels cheap and I was disappointed with the purchase.
George,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 29, 2022",Good Value !!,Light & comfortable.........just enough quilting for the fall chill. Good Value !!!
Belinda probert,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 28, 2022",It says black hood but it’s a gray hood otherwise it a very nice jacket,It says black hood but it’s a grey hood !!!
Robert Elsee,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 19, 2022",Comfy,I purchased this and it seems to run a bit bigger than most larges i’ve purchased in the past.
ME,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 24, 2022",I like this jacket,"I ordered a 3x but I think I would have been fine with a xl or 2x. This thing is huge which isn't a bad thing but I wasn't expecting that. The hood will hang down past my chin if I put in on all the way. I also thought this had a zipper but it's a button up. The pockets are deep on the sides which I don't care for. Would have been nice of ot had some inner pocket ad well. None of these are particularly negative, I still love this jacket. The color is awesome and it's very warm. If I end up buying another one I'll definitely get a size smaller. I do recommend this jacket."
Matt,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 2, 2022",worth the price,"I work outside and wanted a thinner hoodie to wear under my winter coat but could not find one with a quilted lining. The quilted lining helps it to slip on and off easily. Not heavy but stops the wind pretty well. I wanted a zip up but this is probably better because unless it's a CARHART the zipper will always fail eventually. Again, not for very cold weather on its own but exactly what I wanted. I bought another one a week later."
Kell Williamson,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 6, 2022",Insulated thermal flannel,"Awesome buy.. has side pockets as well as working top pockets. Has a nice insulated inside, will not grab or pull. I biught thos fo my son, so I went one size up. But you can stay teue to size. He has plenty of room in his. Highly recommend"
Frequent shopper,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 12, 2022",Warm and Lightweight!,"I finally got to take this jacket on a test drive. I'd finally killed my old one after about a decade (that was just a sherpa lined fleece).This jacket is surprisingly warm for how lightweight it is. Granted, I always have a sweater on, so I'm kind of layering. Still, it definitely does the job and keeps the bite from the wind out. Great jacket and very comfortable!My one complaint would be that I would have preferred a zipper. But, it is a very, very small complaint and not enough to stop me from ordering another in the future."
"N,C,Girl",5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022","Accurate  size fits best,Very roomy",I loved this jacket however  I ordered  a size up in fear it may run smaller but wow I was shocked in how roomy this jacket is nice colors  and quality is great.If you order this you might consider it does fit to size.
Chad Coontz,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022",Worth the 30 bucks,Comfy and warm. Hood is huge. This shirt jac runs a half size large on me. I wear a 2X tshirt and this XL short jac is roomy. Wish it had a zipper or at least snaps.
Teena Laroue,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 6, 2022",Great,"I bought the wrong color so while I did return it, it was only because of the color change. Otherwise it is definitely worth the money and it looks great on."
Alicen Marroquin,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022",Husband loves it,Got for my husband for his birthday and he loves it. It's a little bigger then I was hoping but he loves it either way
esme,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 23, 2022",9/10,I brought this product for my dad as a Christmas gift. It’s his favorite color so hopefully he likes it. I ordered a large and I’m certain it’ll fit him perfectly. Overall it’s good quality so I would definitely recommend buying it.
B V,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 11, 2022","Very nice product, well made","I looked at many, many flannels and this one stood out as quality"
David Christopher,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 18, 2019",Warning - contains anti-microbial additive (embedded nanosilver particles),"I was really excited about ordering these shirts after much research, only to be sorely disappointed when they arrived in the mail.My primary concern is their ""Dual Defense"" additives, specifically IntelliFresh, which refers to DuPont's SILVADUR embedded nanosilver particles. This is not mentioned *ANYWHERE* in Amazon's product description or photos, so I thought it was worth posting a review for others to be aware. I have included photos of the packaging so you can see what I mean.What's so bad about nanosilver? Isn't odor-fighting, moisture wicking technology a good thing?!I used to think so, but now don't anymore. I encourage you to do your own research, but the latest info says it is best to avoid antimicrobials completely because they provide no net benefit to humans and many of them are suspected endocrine-disruptors. Nanosilver is relatively new and not well-researched compared to traditional silver, but it can pass the blood-brain barrier and if ingested could interfere with your healthy gut bacteria.Additionally, silver is extremely toxic to marine life (second only to mercury), and when these particles wash out of your clothes in the laundry, they will eventually end up either in the ocean/rivers, or in wastewater treatment plant sludge, which is often land-applied as fertilizer. This could do massive harm to ecosystems.If you want to learn more, search online for the ""six classes of chemicals"" website and then go to the section on Antimicrobials. The Resources section at the bottom of the page has links to lots of useful info, including:--""Silver Nanotechnology and the Environment: Old Problems or New Challenges,"" Pew Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies report, 2008--""Some antibacterials come with worrisome silver lining."" Chicago Tribune, 2/16/2014--""Germ-resistant clothes: pick or pass?"" ABC News, 3/11/2012I have no affiliation with that website; a coworker shared it with me recently which triggered me to research more on my own.I returned the undershirts to Amazon immediately and did not open the package, so I can't speak to their fit or durability. I suspect they are great shirts except for the nanosilver additive, which makes this all the more disappointing.Fruit of the Loom, if you're reading this, please offer these exact same shirts but in plain old cotton (no additives)! I would happily pay for that."
XaH,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022",Refurbished t shirts?,"Apparently I made a mistake and purchased from the used mechanics t shirt collection. T shirts arrived in a timely manner but I pay for prime so this is not really a positive. However I didn't expect to unwrap my tshirts and see obvious oil stains and a few dog hairs folded into my supposedly new t shirt. Now I'll be the first to admit I was planning to work on my car while wearing these, but I'd love to have added the grease stains myself."
BobP,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 24, 2022",Don't waste your money !,"Ordered these because of the name brand.  These are really lightweight tees that after you wash and dry them once shrink about two sizes. They have the thin little collar that after you wear the shirt for an hour the collar is already sagging. Just a bunch of low quality import junk, and a waste of money.  They went to the Goodwill the day after I washed them."

They fit wonderfully for the first wash or two, but afterwards, they shrink so badly that if I even sit down, the shirt comes untucked instantly.  The neck is also made of some of the weakest materials I've ever seen in a shirt before.  It stretches out so easily that the shirt basically becomes a v-neck within a couple of months.The only other option I have is to order the large size, but then the neck hole is so enormously large, that two of me can fit inside of it.  Also, the sleeve's on the large are just way too loose and long, so they come out from under my short sleeve button-down that I wear over these.I do NOT recommend these shirts."

First it looked and fit good out of packaging, however I always wash my shirts before wearing them. Washing and drying the shirts on low shrunk them a size at least.

After being washed and dried as instructions had said, the shirts shrunk up at least 2 inches and the sleeves shrunk at least an inch or two as well making these shirts and it’s sleeves way too short. These tshirts had shrunk at least one size just with one wash and dryer cycle. So if you are looking for a quality tshirt, these aren’t the ones. Just stick with any other brand."

Yo compré una original y  son muy diferentes además vienen demasiado chicas para la talla que son yo pedí unas talla L por qué mi esposo es talla M y pensé que le quedarían bien pero cuando se las puso le quedan apretadas y luego en cuanto las lave se encogieron más todavía que ahora parece que le quedan como playera deportiva pegada al cuerpo. No la recomiendo a menos que ya sepan a lo que le tiran y siempre pidan mínimo 2 tallas más a la que utilizan para que así les queden bien y no se encojan tanto al lavarlas.

In the one I received, the light gray shirt fit the best and felt the lightest. However, the dark blue/black felt a little heavier and not the same material.

Eduardo Garcia,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 22, 2022",Nice shirts but shrink,The shirts were pretty nice. Feel nice and look good. Only problem is that they shrank after one wash.

They stay tucked even for a tall guy with a long torso. Excellent price.Cons: the undershirt collar stretches out by the end of the day and would look sloppy if his dress shirt collar was unbuttoned. The seams on the sleeves and the shirt bottom always roll when laundered; if they are to lay flat you’ve got spray them or iron them.

Oh well, my wife got some new shirts. I will order these again, just will order XXL to accommodate the shrinkage. Love that they are tag less, fabric is medium weight, so should have decent durability. Fabric was soft and comfortable.UPDATE: ordered in 2x, gave them a wash, shrunk a little as expected. Nicer fit for my preference. More room around the chest / arms. Very comfortable. Didn't get a purple on this time :(, 2 black instead. Colors do vary from picture."

Maddy Acton,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 8, 2022",This jacket is for fashion ONLY (and just barely); NOT utility!,"I loved the style of this jacket and the reviews were good, so it was on my watchlist for a while. It went on sale mid March 2022 so I took a flyer on it - I live in Florida most of the time, so I didn't need to wear it, other than try it on, until I went back up north (Canada) December 2022. What a piece of actual garbage this jacket is. I was originally happy with the finish of the fabric and the cut but this is strictly a city slick fashion jacket, not for utility by any stretch of the imagination.The pictures speak for themselves. It didn't even make it to the cabin in the Canadian wilds, the side ripped and both front pockets tore out while I was just visiting my sister in New York City. I seriously only wore it out twice. This piece of crap would have fallen off my body in tatters if I had swung the axe once in it.Thank God I bought my leather jacket as a back up, I would have been absolutely screwed otherwise - in below freezing temperatures. Shame on this manufacturer.The quality of the stitching is so flimsy, I don't know if I'll even bother trying to stitch it, this might be destined for the compost bin. Very disappointing. A complete and utter waste of money and way past the return date.If you were planning on actually moving and wearing this jacket, DO NOT be fooled and think this thing will last more than a few trips to the grocery store. I'd have been better off in a dollar store rain poncho."
Blue Light,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022",The fit just isnt right,"I'm an average sized guy, most things I wear a large. This is the 2nd time I've taken a chance on legendary whitetails, and they just dont fot right. This item is so long it looks like an oversized parka rather than a working flannel.

It is pretty thin overall.  I have flannel shirts that are more warm. I'm very disappointed... it's on its way back to Amazon for a refund."
Jonathan Hitt,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 11, 2019",This jacket looks great but is not functional!,"I've had this jacket about a year now and I really feel compelled to leave a review to warn others considering this purchase.Let me start with the positives...the jacket itself looks great. The outer material is soft and I really like the brown color.  This is a light jacket and it is very comfortable as long as you do not need to snap it or put your hands in the pockets.  More on that later. That's pretty much the only positives.There are a few negatives that make this jacket almost unwearable in my opinion.  One of the main issues which I noticed in other reviews is that the snaps are very weak.  It does not take much to make them come undone.  This alone wouldn't be a big deal, but the other flaws in this jacket exaggerate the weak snaps.  First of all, the jacket is not cut for normal bodied men.  If you put the jacket on and button it, the pockets are set waaaaaay too far back.  Very unnatural position .  That itself creates too much tension on the front which unsnaps the jacket.  Also, when you sit down, the bottom 2 or 3 snaps come undone every time.  Finally, you have to unsnap the ends of the sleeves when putting on ot taking off the jacket.  (These snaps are weak as well)  The position of the snaps make the armhole too small.  I can't put my hands through the jacket without it unsnapping.Bottom line....if you need a lightweight jacket and do not need to keep it snapped or use the pockets, this one will be okay.  But overall, I do not recommend this jacket.  It's a shame since I think it's really good looking."
ELMarkey,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 14, 2021","Much to the dismay of my wife, I hate this jacket...","This may be great for a someone who wants to pretend that they are rugged, but if you are looking for a functional jacket, it totally misses the mark.CONS:1) Thin and lightweight, so it doesn't provide much warmth.2) The flannel lining is nice but thin. Definitely not traditional flannel material.3) Sleeves are not lined with the flannel material, only a silk-like lining (definite sign that this is made for looks, not work.)4) My biggest gripe is the side hand pockets... who in the world thought this position was a good idea? (3 and 9 o'clock positions). You need to reach BEHIND yourself to get your hands into the pockets! Either Legendary Whitetails didn't plan on users using these pockets or they didn't test it before production with real people. Since the pockets are sewn right into the 3-9 seams, I believe they were just lazy.PROS:1) Nice color2) Outer material has seems well-made3) Buttons are awesome4) Chest and internal pockets are greatFINAL THOUGHTS: The side hand pocket issues are a non-negotiable for me. It would never be remotely close to my favorite jacket even with this fixed. If you only want this for a light layer to go out in the evening and have no use for side pockets, then this is the jacket for you! If you are looking at this for use in the shop, the cold, hiking, or tactical, look elsewhere."
Kathy Welker,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022",Disappointed,Disappointed in the fabric. It’s almost got a shine to it and isn’t the Normal cotton outer layer. Also disappointed the flannel lining doesn’t go down the sleeves. It’s not that it’s bad quality just not what I was expecting at all even after reading description and reviews.
Tom Normile,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022",Poor quality,"Don't think a flannel should rip out reaching for you keys in your pocket. Made in China, I should not expect quality but to at least last more than a week. Will never buy again."
Thomas,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 26, 2022",Nothing legendary about this product,"I have nothing good to say about this one.

JD,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 28, 2022",Built for looks not work,"Ordered this with intentions of using it as a fall work jacket. This is obviously built for looks not work. I would call this more of a heavy shirt made for someone who wanted to dress up like a outdoorsman. The outer shell has a very slick silky feel. Inside liner is a very thin flannel like material, however it does not have flannel material in the arms so obviously made for looks and not actual work. Stitching looks poor on seems and pockets. I would not expect this thing to hold up through a work season. Sizing seems to be pretty accurate. Overall if you wanna look like a rugged outdoorsman who pays way to much for inferior clothing then this is for you. If your actually wanting to wear this while working I’d keep shopping."
Daniel Rubel,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 3, 2022",Would be great if it was created correctly,"So this seems like a pretty good jacket, was quite looking forward to it. Then it shows up, and the right arm is sewn twisted so it's damn near impossible to get your arm through (IE: the inner lining is twisted if the outer arm is straight, the outer arm is twisted if you rotate the inner lining."
Carrie,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 24, 2022",This was everything I wanted... but..,"The Velcro in the inside pocket was so much stronger than the sewn corner joint, that the sewn joint failed within a week just trying to put my phone in it. Terrible shame. I really liked this coat a lot. I loved this coat, it fits right, noting about it I can complain,... but the weak sewn inside coat pocket is now a flap.  I was hoping for years of use. I don't know how to fix it now."

Devin,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",Hope the outside holds up better than the inside.,"Within 2 weeks the stitching on the ""hand warmer"" pockets has come undone and crated holes. The Velcro is so strong that one corner is starting to lift on the chest pocket. The sleeves if this jacket are NOT flannel lined and there isn't any material to keep your arms warm. If it's cold plan on a long sleeve underneath. Had high hopes for this jacket especially for the price, and most have been underwhelming.Size and fit were good. As is the warmth of the flannel lining on the torso and chest. Only hope is the ""waxed"" cotton exterior holds up much longer than the interior."
Bill Hopper,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 18, 2022",Tobacco much darker than pic,"We'll..not what I expected. Not heavy and comfortable as pic implies. Feels more like a nice and stiff windbreaker for the shell and inside is just  flannel looking fabric. The design has hand pockets entering nearer the hips, stretch those arms back, rather than closer towards the front. Hands will not touch when inside the pockets. The connections are snap not buttons. Fits well, I got a large and am 6' 217lbs. However, the gut shouldn't be too big, like mine, or it will button up for a very unflattering look. Overall a good layer against rain or wind, not much on warmth."
Melvin Smith,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 28, 2022","Looks good, but bad stitching","This jacket looks great and wears well.  It is comfortable and quite suited to a cool (but not cold) day.  Haven't had a chance to test its water resistance.The problem is with the quality of the stitching.  I have had both long seams running from the armpit to the top of the side pockets simply unravel.  I have not subjected the jacket to any kind of heavy duty use.  I'm fairly handy with a needle and able to repair the seam, but I shouldn't have to do this with a new jacket.I'm not sorry I bought it, but I would not buy it, or any other garment made by this company, again.  Their quality control is not what it should be."

Debbie,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 17, 2022",Not as nice as I thought it would be.,"The first one I ordered was used! This 2nd one was in much better condition, however not as well made as I thought it would be ~ stitching coming apart. Definitely not worth the price (which has gone up & down, up & down the past month)! Also, not as thick as I was hoping. Thicker than a regular shirt, but for the price I thought it would have had a little thickness to it for warmth. Purchased for my brother who doesn’t like a coat, but he’d freeze in this! Ordered a large so he’d be comfortable w/a hoodie underneath. Found another that’s better quality, thicker material, made thicker & about $30 less!"
Jeff,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 2, 2018","Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .","The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."
Randy Moore,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 22, 2022","Good lightweight jacket, but sizes are off","I purchased this jacket along with a Legendary Whitetails Buck Camp flannel shirt, both in size large, and both of them fit more like an extra large. My closet is nothing but size large for shirts and jackets, and while most brands have some variation in their sizing, these were just ridiculous. I did like how they looked and felt though, so decided to exchange them both for a medium size. There's a reason I don't wear medium, because it's too small across my chest and shoulders... and would you believe it their medium fits exactly like a medium. lol. I still kept them both though since I like the way they look, I just can't button them comfortably. Really wish the large fit like a normal large."
dumeril7,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 25, 2022",Nice jacket-shirt. I'm happy with the purchase.,"Overall, I'd say this jacket-shirt exceeded expectations. First impression is that it is more hefty than I expected, which is a good thing. For warmth, I would say that it's warm enough for fall/spring in my area (mid-Atlantic), especially if you put a good base layer under it. But it is not heavy enough for winter, which is fine. I bought this as a cool weather jacket and have heavier jackets for colder weather. Water does bead a bit on the outer fabric, but I'll probably wax it if/when that beading starts to go away.The ""barley"" color that I got matched the Amazon photos pretty well. At first glance (and in the Amazon photos), the shirt appears to have a rugged, worn-in look with a bit of natural color texture from ""wear"". But it's not color texture, the outer fabric actually has a bit of sheen that reflects light giving that effect. The fabric also has an unexpected feel: Instead of a slightly coarse cottony feel, it has a smooth satiny feel. And the cloth is very tightly woven - more so than your usual work shirt. None of this matters to me as I like both the look and feel of it. But if you're particular that a shirt like this should look and feel a certain way, then you may not like it. The inside is lined with cotton flannel for the torso and polyester for the sleeves. Lining the sleeves with a slicker cloth makes it easier take off without accidentally turning the sleeves inside-out, but if you prefer maximum insulation, polyester is not ideal.The sizing was pretty true to the chart. Maybe just a tad bigger, but not much. Be aware that it's not a modern slim fit though; it's a regular or classic fit. I'm 6'2"" and 210 lbs and the LT size fit pretty ideally with the sleeve cuffs folded up, which is what I wanted. I recommend taking measurements of yourself to ensure you order the right size. A few minutes of effort before you order could avoid several days of delay and a lot of hassle after."
Mig,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 14, 2022",Looks great in person,If this holds up I’ll be very happy.  I already ordered in 2 more colors.  Received 2 compliments first time i wore it.

This is fine if you like a snug fit I recommend getting your correct size for maximum comfort. (Person wearing in pics isn’t me) I’m 6’2 245 and I use this for work and leisure. I currently don’t have any complaints. The quality is good also
kevin atwood,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",Excellent look and the fit is spot on,"This fit is perfect. I ordered my normal large and it fits as all my large shirts would. Quality seems very good, the metal snaps work as they should, the length covers most of my butt( not to short and not to long). I ordered it in the tobacco color and it is well represented in the stock photo. The sleeve length is very good. The fabric feels like a waxed cotton, I feel like it would be fairly rain resistant. I have not worn it in the rain as of yet. I would highly recommend this shacket. I dont think you would be disappointed"
Adam,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 8, 2022",Good quality but Amazon screws up the shipping,"This journeyman shirt jacket is actually really great, I'm 6'4"" 255-260lbs depending on the day and I normally year xl to xxl. I bought this with the intention of layering. The xxl is a bit big and it's not quite long enough for me. So I'm returning for a xl tall.What is screwed up here is how Amazon is handling this product- they shipped this to me in the clear plastic that this shirt jacket comes in and just slapped a shipping label on it. That's like putting a shipping label on a PS5 and saying here steal and abuse this product. Very poor choice by Amazon."
Rod,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 22, 2022",GREAT FALL/SPRING JACKET,"I wanted a lightweight ""weekend"" jacket that wasn't bulky but was warm.  Needed pockets for all the things I carry and long enough to keep me warm.  I am a big guy and found the 4x just a touch big, but I also bought the 3x Tall and found the chest to be just a touch tight (not bad though) I think I needed a 3.5x or lose some weight!Anyway, quality is good, washed up nicely.  2 pockets on chest, 2 typical side pockets and 1 inside.  The side pocket openings are on the side, so you do have to reach to get them, again not a deal breaker.  It has a small marketing patch on the sleeve, which is fine I guess, not overly big so does not look like military patching.Overall, really satisfied with the purchase."
Melissa Sugar,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 1, 2022","Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket","I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"
Jeremy krause,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 18, 2022","Not quite the style I expected, but exceeds my expectations.","First off, it’s a little more of a aviator or military style than I expected, and that’s fine, but the comfort is fantastic. The size is perfect for me, at 5’11” and 195 lbs, It’s lightweight, and roomy without being big or droopy. It feels like it’ll last a good long time, I’ll be wearing it as a work coat, doing some light construction and warehouse work. Compared to my Dickies coat I’d say it’s just as good quality by first impression, time will tell. The pockets are deep and secure, and the unique buttons are strong and still easy to snap and unsnap. I’ll definitely look at more of this company’s products from here on out."
onetimehack,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 27, 2022",Surprisingly comfortable,"When I got it in the mail, I was a little disappointed because it was so light and seemingly flimsy.

I have been pleasantly surprised and I would buy it again.  I will give another update in 1 year to see if it is durable.

AND i WILL BE RETURNING IT... i AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN AMAZON!First my husband loves Amour Legging COLDGEAR for winter walks and runs! They are expensive but when he couldn't find his COLDGEAR from last winter and with the mornings getting a bit cold, I had to buy him a new pair.  He only had 2 leggings from a couple of winters, one thermal and one COLDGEAR and he tolerated the thermals and LOVED the COLDGEAR so it was a no brainer.  I even ordered a pair for the adult son who has taken up morning runs.  The price I think is very high for leggings BUT THEY LAST! I mean they are really well made with good material.  So... $55 is worth it.  HOWEVER..... I WAS A BIT CONFUSED when the price tag in the package was marked at $50.... I paid Amazon $55 twice (2 pairs) and they have a price tag shoing $50.... I feel cheated or stupid... Taken advantage of.  I am torn. They are a good product and I don't want to use the free returns... but I also don't like paying more than they are marked....  I will update when I decide what we will do.  Good product. Worth $55... still..... maybe remove the tags????"

Sarcar,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 10, 2022",Product changes you ought to know,"Long time user of several of these. Like them, that's why bought another. This generation has a few changes. The UA logo is moved from the calf to the front thigh. It is smaller, and unlike the calf logo - does not stretch. The calf logo was beautiful and carried the brand elegantly. This logo is tiny and unimposing.The groin area is differently cut/stitched; it does not sit as comfortably as my other ones. I am not a tailor, so my review is on ""feel"" only.The material is nice, warm - like my previous ones - as expected."
CA,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 30, 2022",Runs EXTREMELY small.,"The quality of these are great.  However, they run extremely small.  I ordered my son an adult small (which is his usual size and he has other Under Armour cold gear leggings this size that are a perfect fit), but they look and fit like a youth large.  We thought that maybe they would stretch, but when he tried them on, his movement was noticeably restricted.  He was so disappointed that I am returning them for an adult large (yes, they're that small).  Otherwise, they would be great."

When I order these leggings I had no doubt that they would live up to my expectations of the Under Armour brand and they did not disappoint. The fit and finish is perfect. No loose threads or bad stitching to be found. I started out with one pair to make sure I'd be happy with them and quickly purchased a second pair a few weeks later. I definitely would recommend them.

Some lasted only one wearing.  They all developed holes in the sole after normal wear.  What a waste of money.  I made a mistake of buying Hanes again after the poor experience with the previous purchase.  I won't make the same mistake again."

Riding shotgun on top of the elevator too get my 8-foot couch to my 14th-floor apartment.2. Buying these socks. I originally bought the same socks size 10-13, which is in my range. Those socks were large enough to use as protective storage for a school wall clock. I returned them and got these 7-9 size socks, which were, amusingly, even larger. Perhaps I misread and the sizing is now for clown shoes."
Stephen White,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 3, 2022","They are not thick enough,or lighter material","After just one or two time's wearing these I had holes in them where the big toe is,and started to wear at the heel.

I wouldn't recommend buying if your feet are smaller than a 11-12. I would like to know why I got one pk of Fruit of the Loom.

John McGehee,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 12, 2022","Good for 2-3 Wearings, then toss","It has been a while since I tried any Hanes products, but I thought they must be decent with such a long history.These socks started out well, soft and snug, but after 2 or 3 washings they lost all shape!My experience with *non-Hanes* socks has been that I wear, wash, and repeat until they start to wear through the heels, usually after a few months.These would be good socks to take on a trip, when you plan to leave them behind to make more room in your suitcase for the trip home."
RyCa,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 23, 2022",comfortable but thin and wear out easily,"They feel great, but within the first couple times wearing them they began to pill up and shed their material.

B. Clark,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 9, 2017","Low cost, VERY lightweight socks... needs more cotton in the blend!","We use Hanes ankle length socks over the summer & we really liked them.  As the weather got colder & we switched to long pants & my search for Hanes crew socks found these.The pros:+ Low cost of $12.54 with free Amazon shipping when I bought a 12 pack.+ Pretty good customer product reviews.+ Advertised - soft cotton blend - cotton/polyester/natural latex rubber/nylon.+ Advertised - classic crew socks each featuring ribbed leg, comfort-toe seam, and cushioned sole.+ Advertised - Fresh IQ advanced odor protection technology.The cons:- VERY thin, too thin in my opinion, but my son likes these.  They're comfortable, but my feet get cold wearing these around the house!- Socks washed once in the washing machine are covered with ""fluff balls""... also called ""pilling""!- Advertised - 54% Polyester,42% Cotton,3% Rubber,1% Nylon. ◄ Much less cotton in these socks, compared to the Hanes ankle length socks we wore over the warmer months.- Advertised - imported. ◄ For those that prefer to buy products made in the USA.Closing remarks:▪ There's no way I'm going to wash these by hand & as bad as they look after one machine washing, odds are pretty good I won't be buy any more of these socks!► Update November 25, 2017▪ These are looking pretty ratty after a few machine washing cycles.  They are completely functional, but totally covered in ""fluff balls""... also called ""pilling""!,  They're now in the ""Give Back Box"" ready to be donated.▪ To replace these socks, I went with these which have 76% cotton, 22% polyester:

B. Engle,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 9, 2022",Not befitting the Hanes brand,"Very thin, lightweight fabric — too little cotton in the blend. I’ve been buying Hanes socks for years (formerly from Costco), and the quality has been great. But these are like the cheap street market grab-bin knock-offs I used to see in Asia; they look like the real thing but aren’t. Yes, they are soft, but too a fault. The polyester content is so high I’m concerned about fire risk when doing chores like brush burning or welding. I’m afraid they’d melt to the skin rather than behave inertly like the mostly cotton socks do when exposed to embers or weld spatter."

Amy Diotte,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 4, 2022",Not the Hanes quality of a few years ago,"Received my socks today and they are just as expected. While they are comfortable, my biggest complaint is since Hanes reduced the amount of cotton in the socks, which is now less than 50%, they wear out at least twice as fast as they used to do when they had a much higher cotton content. I used to go about 2 years before holes would appear in the bottom of the socks, but since the cotton content is so low now I wear through them in about a year. While I prefer the higher cotton content for comfort and durability, the new formula does wick the sweat better so that's about the only advantage.  Also, the elastic in the new formula doesn't hold up as well and as I type this with my brand new pair of socks on for the first time, they are ""falling down"" and need pulling up."

The earlier model socks were great - I was loyal to them and they were very comfortable and provide good cushion in my work boots.  These new ones, not so much.  Still, they're socks, and they cover my feet, and wick the sweat.  I'm not sending them back, might get more if I need more socks, but I'm still not happy.  I want my old model socks."

Christopher E,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 4, 2022",Alternate use:  dog treat dispenser!,"These were so cheap on sale that I use them for dog treats. I put a soft treat in the toe and tie it in place with a piece of string.  My husky loves the work of getting to the treat, taking him about 5 minutes.  (I think he’s an average  chewer.)  Next time I add a new treat above the string I used last time and add another piece of string to hold the new treat in place.  With this method one large sock serves as a treat holder about 8 times, making these socks far cheaper than just about any other chew toy or treat dispenser I can give my dog!  Of course, this only works because my dog doesn’t eat the string or pieces of the sock."

Better than normal in that regard, but I don't know if it'll actually fit a size 14. Might be the best you can easily find though.My only quibble is with the length. These are supposed to be Crew length but they're a couple of inches too long on me (6'1""). So the shaft, since it rides on the thicker part of my ankle right below the calf, is a bit  tight.Nevertheless this is a good sock and I'll probably buy them again next time."

JK,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 9, 2022",Wrong description of material/fabric content,"At the time of this review, the description states that this product is 70% cotton. Instead, I received socks that are only 42% cotton, with the rest of the fabric being polyester. Thank goodness I check things carefully, or my son would have had a a burning rash that requires him to get prescription creams from his doctor - again. I do wish that fabric contents were more accurate on Amazon. My son can get away with a small amount of polyester on some items (not underwear), but when it ends up being the majority of the material, he always has to go to the doctor to medical care. If companies were even half as careful with their customers' skin as they are with food allergies, the world would be a safer place for those with skin sensitivities and allergies."

After 5 times wearing each pair three more socks had holes and the holes were getting larger. They feel thin. Paper thin. They are advertised as thick work socks that are designed to be durable. They aren't. My feet hurt wearing them. I am betting they are not made in the USA. I will never buy any again. I have never had socks fall apart so fast.

The new size 15-17 is several inches smaller than the old size 12-15. I have emailed dickies asking them what happened to the best socks ever."

They will be returned and I will not purchase again.  I can only presume the material is different than previous versions.

Well, after about a week of light use, I'm down two and a half of these new pairs. To be fair, I do sometimes wear these socks while boxing and working out, but I work from home and don't go out much, and the first pack held up doing the same and more pre-covid.

I thought that maybe it was a bad sock, but it was the same for the entire multi-pack. Unfortunately for Dickies, I just purchased new socks from Adidas and Under Armour to see if the quality is any better."
Amazon Customer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 19, 2022",Defeats the purpose,"I got these socks because my sneakers were pulling my ankle socks down into the shoe. I needed slightly higher socks. For that purpose, they work just fine. Problem is, these things are thick. The moisture wicking fabric is essentially a rag. This actually causes my foot to sweat when it otherwise wouldn't. I bought these under the impression they would keep my feet dry. My feet are very not dry."
Richard,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 20, 2022",Holes on the front right side of all pairs over time.,"Socks are thick and warm. I remember thinking they were TOO thick when I first wore them. Very slippery on wood floors. Sometimes sticks to dry heels because of the fibers, but I grew to like them… until the holes started to develop. Same spot on all socks regardless of the foot I wear them on - front right. I won’t be buying these again."
Travis,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 26, 2022",Not durable,I loved these socks... at first. I haven't even had these for 2 months and I just noticed a hole already! I can't return them or get a refund because I have had them too long apparently. I feel ripped off! These were the best socks I had ever owned until this.
R. Roberson,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 21, 2022",Falling apart,I actually love dickies products because of the styling and price. I’ve purchased these socks before so maybe I got a bad batch. All of them are separating in various spots on the sock but mostly on the top of the foot. See pic attached. Hopefully this is a one-off and it won’t happen to a anyone else.

Gads,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 25, 2022",My unintentional head to head test vs. Amazon Essentials.,"Hysterical to think about it now, but I bought two different brands of black socks thinking I would get somewhere with at least one.  I ended up wearing one of each over the weekend.  Who was the winner?  Let me take you through it.8pm night before - I put the Amazon Essentials Black socks on after a shower, wore them for two hours and then took them off and went to bed.6am - my 1 year old son wakes up earlier than expected.  Its dark, I can't find one of the socks.  I quickly reached in and grabbed another sock, not realizing it is my dickies sock.  I am now wearing two different pairs of socks, both brand new.10am - I run around with my son in our basement (vinyl floors).  Both socks feel good.1pm - I put on my timberland boots and clear up some ice that ended up on my front steps5pm - Dinner and whatnot - wood floors8pm - Kids are down for the night.  I sit on the couch and feel a slight breeze.  I can't believe it, it didn't even last one day!My amazon essentials sock?  Perfect.If you would have asked me which one I thought would last, my answer would have been the name brand.  Perhaps it was an anomaly, only time will tell.  But I like the amazon ones better regardless.Good luck!"
JK,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 18, 2022",Holes super fast - otherwise comfortable,"Love these socks - except they get holes super fast just from wearing.Bought these Dec 6 2021, it's March 18 2022 and every pair has been worn through - I bought a couple packages.Holes in heels, toes and even on top of arch? weird.Very comfortable as I am Men's 13 and ordered XLI ordered a couple packages so I had many gray socks to just grab and go.Now they are all gone to sock heaven from holes.I can't believe they wore so fast as I have a drawer full of other socks from years ago.I didn't go walk on concrete without shoes or anything crazy, I just wore them with sneakers and walking shoes...just like my other socks.I liked these because I get gout and these were large enough to let my feet breathe and they were thick and comfy - I'm actually quite bummed about it...not the money...just having dependable socks that can go with jeans or shorts or even khakis without thinking about the sock being too thin or just an ankle sock.I ordered some other brand and am washing them now but they seem thinner and longer....I can't believe I can't find a thick short sturdy gray sock."
Joanne M.,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022","Wore once, had a hole",I wore these socks one day and had a hole in one of them. I would not buy them again.
CE Hardin,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022","Comfortable, but they slide around.",The socks are comfortable I like the feel but I have one problem with the socks and that is due to them sliding around my foot/ankle. I'm not sure how it happens especially in shoes but the gray striped portion should be at the bottom and it should say Dickies on top where your toes are. After a few hours of movement they somehow slide to the gray striped making their way to the top of my foot. They still feel comfortable but I can tell when taking the sock off it's in the wrong position due to the heel to ankle cut and also depending what type of shoes I wear I prefer not showing half gray stripes/black. It can be noticable by from the ankle and doesn't look right.Outside of thay issue they're fine.
Jennifer,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 19, 2022",Large,"I purchased the 12 pair of quarter socks size 12-15. I wear size 14 or 15 shoes, and these socks are quite large on me. They're snug diameter but much longer than they should be.They're thick and comfortable. I haven't had any issues with them shedding like I had with the Member's Mark socks.After about 8 months (worn approximately 20 times), I've had 2 socks develop holes in the ball of the foot. They didn't get thin and wear out, they just seem to have unraveled there. The rest of the socks are still in good shape."
Daniel,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 11, 2022","Very comfortable, but doesn't hold up as long as I would like.","Pros: Very comfortable, looks great, good moisture wicking, true to size.Cons: Not as durable or last as long as I think they should.I have been using them for about a year, minus the winter months, and they are usually my go to socks (right height, feet stay dry, goes great with all colors of clothing), but after about 6-8 months of wear and wash they started getting thin in the ball and heel area. After about 12 months of wear I have thrown away several pair for having large holes on the heel area, and every pair now is on its last legs.I have mixed feelings about these. I have had hanes and fruit of the loom socks that have lasted for multiple years before having to replace them, these only about a years worth of wear. But on the other hand they perform great for that year."
Allison Walsh,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 30, 2022",Socks are fine but packaging is terrible. Plastic tag holders tear sock fibers.,"They attach socks to cardboard with extremely tiny plastic retail tag holders, the kind that gets shot from a needle gun. Every end was so tiny that they all got caught on threads. Now 6 different socks per package had the issue in the photo.Boot length socks had much larger tag holders, easy to remove, but not these ankle socks. Socks wear out fast enough, I sure don't need a head start on tearing the fibers!"
Rick History,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022",They stretch pretty good,"I wear size 14 and they stretched to fit.  Not sure how long they'll last, they shed pretty good."
Faith,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 28, 2022","Okay for price, but not moisture wicking","Bought these for my boyfriend, who typically has trouble with his feet and moisture throught the day. His only comments so far are that they are very comfortable, but they aren't moisture wicking. He said if anything, his feet sweat more with the socks on than his normal socks that he has. He still wears them due to being more socks in his drawer, but not as impressed with the ""moisture wicking"" aspect. Which is why I only gave 4/5 stars.If you are looking for comfy socks, these are a pretty good option, if you are looking for actual moisture wicking socks, I recommend not getting these."
Benlives,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 19, 2022",As winter working socks not too bad for the price,"It ran a bit bigger than I expected. For the comfort, I feel it was not that good. But for working socks, it was just good as the price"
Sarah,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 25, 2022","A bit hot on the foot, tight on the leg","These socks seem to be very well made. The toe box has ample room without cramming the toes forcing toward deformity (as-in bunion). Really nice material and a very good fit on the foot. The leg and ankle, not so much. I bought the 12-15 men's quarter socks for my 11-1/2 6E feet and I really want them to work as I've given up on Gold Toe. Unfortunately, the first thing I noticed was how tight the ankle-leg opening is, even to the point of being a bit hard to put on, then overly snug on the leg (constricted skin indentations to the point of pattern matching to the socks). The next thing was how hot they are. I am in a very warm environment (107°F outside today) so heat matters — a lot. I don't need ""just wicking"" but also ""cool"". These are not cool. They are quite warm, on the order of cold weather socks but not extreme cold.As much as I'd like these to work, they're going back chiefly because of the too-tight ankles-legs but also because they're too hot for the summers here."
Curtis H.,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 29, 2022",Cheap,"I expected more out of Dickies. They are thin, a little scratchy and don't wick at all.  They get 3 stars just because they arrived on time and fit.  But they are cheap socks. No comfort."
John Stephen,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 4, 2022",More low rise than the photo indicates,"These socks are lower-rise than I thought they would be from the picture.  These low-rise socks are uncomfortable for me.  They work well, though."
Gregg Burtnett,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022",One minor complaint.,These socks fit great!  Most are just a bit too tight after washing. I’m a 12 EE so these are a huge improvement over the fits 9-12 socks.Pro Tip: wash them inside out a couple times and the fuzz won’t stick to your feet.We’ll see how the hold up.
yankee2,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 17, 2022","EXC everyday socks, seem to run slightly large","I like these socks, but contrary to most reports, they seem to me to run a little large. They are supposed to fit shoe size 6-12, and my feet are size 11, yet these socks are slightly LOOSE on my slender feet. I have to keep them perfectly straight and manipulate them when I put on my shoe, so that folds don’t form (am not sure how people with smaller feet fit at all). Except for this, I like everything about these socks.I should add that just to see if they might fit better, I tried a pack of the next size smaller, for shoe size 5-9, and they are perfect, if perhaps a tiny bit snug. Still they fit me much better than the nominally correct size. I'll be giving my stock of the bigger size to Goodwill...I have to say these socks seem to run large."
Paul Snyder,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 21, 2022",They are socks.,These socks go on your feet. Kind of like mittens but for your feet. They fit good and stay on until you remove them. They provide a layer of cloth between your feet and your shoes. I wear them with my 3/4 golf shoes. I blame them for any bad shots or putts when golfing because it couldn't possibly be something I did wrong. I like coors light and a scotch on the rocks as chaser. I would recommend these socks to a friend or family member.

I have so many styles of work socks &  casual socks & athletic socks, all Dickies & I may have to give some away because they came out with a new style of work socks & I've already bought 18 pair! So my old ones still look pretty new because I rotate them every couple of weeks. I have summer socks & winter socks. I have Dickes work clothes that I rotate also. The shorts & short sleeves are for summer time & when winter comes around, I pull out the long sleeves & long pants out of the plastic & put the summer work clothes up! When my shirts start to wear thin, I buy 6 to 8 new shirts & i wash & hang the old ones in plastic & drop them at the Good Will. Yes I'm truly blessed & also Dickies always have great prices & coupons to help keep you looking sharp & professional! I am a professional truck driver & my Dickies uniforms keep me looking sharp!

For 15 bucks I can’t be too upset other than to just throw it in the car and use it to blow my nose in if I don’t have anything else on hand.Oh. And it says fleece.

No room for normal casual / work mobility.  Very thin fabric : half the thickness of a typical pullover work sweatshirt.  Feels flimsy.  Not good for outer wear below 50 degrees with a slight breeze outside.  You can get a better deal, more durable, thicker, more roomy sweatshirt at Ross Dress For Less or Burlington.

The quality seems cheaper than the ones I bought in the past. It is far too tight in the wrists. It's also thin. It catches and holds onto ""fuzzies"", especially on the inside. It faded noticeably after just one wash. It was just something to wear before winter hit, but I don't really care for it and don't wear it.

However, fact is: the hoodie has pockets that are so shallow I couldn't carry a phone in a pocket around the house without it falling out and landing on my toes. Ouch! Not fun.The zipper is metal and rough on the skin... going shirtless underneath is out of the question. And the laces are thin, stretchy and slippery like you might find on mostly-plastic shoes... you have to knot it up at the ends to keep the lace from slipping through the eyelets.

I don't see this keeping the chil off you on a 60° fall day.  But if you sweat to death all the time like me it will work just fine.
James A McNaught,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 11, 2022","Does the job, inexpensively","Took a flyer on ""recycled material"" and am pleasantly surprised.  Material is soft, warm, and it fits well, even though I'm long of torso.  Washes well too."

Giovanni,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 16, 2022",Pretty alright the quality is meh,"The hoodie is good but the quality of the hoodie feels cheap, its not bad i like it but it doesn’t feel high value which makes since because the hoodie is cheap so if you dont care much about quality then this hoodie is perfect. its also a lil tight around the wrist but can be worn into and worn out if not careful."

Love inflatable pools,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 29, 2022",Pros and Cons - not perfect but worth $20,"Attractive color,  nice fit, soft fabric, and excellent, proper metal zipper. The issue is that it's a little thinner than my other hoodies, and I only buy inexpensive hoodies. Great for 50 degree weather. 40 degrees?  You gonna suffer."
gina,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 28, 2022",Please read review,I love Kim K's style . I love oversized hoodies.

Cialesh ,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 5, 2022",perfect lightweight coat,"its super soft on the inside, i wasnt so sure the medium was gonna fit how i wanted to because ive always gotten my hoodies/coats in L or XL because i liked them oversized. I decided to get a coat that would fit me better and not so oversized, and this ones perfect it is exactly what im looking for and its super affordable. also its lightweight so if you live somewhere not super warm in the winter i would recommend layering over it or under 👍🏼"
Frfank,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 30, 2022",Exceptional Quality for the Price,"For the price my expectations weren’t very high. I wanted something to just knock around in. When I opened the package I was pleasantly surprised. This zip hoodie was soft and a medium thickness. The size was on the money even the zipper was better quality. I definitely got more for my money. I had bought bigger brand names in the past and was never really satisfied.  It’s just a great looking sweat jacket that is very comfortable. When I want another one, I’ll choose this brand."
Pope Steverino,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022",Like they used to make 'em,"If you grew up in the '80s, these are almost exactly the same as the ones you wore as a kid. They're not very thick but they're cozy, they have a nice, loose fit, and the color of the blue one at least is bright and vibrant. I really love mine and I'm glad I bought it."
Seed,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 12, 2022",Great Sweatshirt,"Our weather is sometimes 30 degrees in the morning and then 60 in the afternoon.  My husband has this old, ratty, stained hoodie sweatshirt that he wears in the mornings when it's cool and he is going for a run or working outside.  I was so tired of it but he said ""it's just a workshirt!""The man does not want to part with anything!So I ordered this, tossed the old one, and waited for repercusions.There were NONE.  He loves it.  He says it is warm enough, yet softer than the one I disposed of (probably really hard for him to admit).  He backed up his comments by wearing it every day so far, and it's going on a week.The price was incredibly low for such a nice sweatshirt.  I offered to order more in different colors, but he said ""no"".  He's happy with his grey hoodie sweatshirt."
Kristopher Fuller,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022","Comfy Hoodie, great color selection!","Very nice hoodies. Love that they had white and the right shades of grey. Just a slight bit bigger than expected, which isn't at all a problem for the price. I wanted to put a bomber over it so I'll probably purchase another one-size smaller since they're so cheap. They typically last a long time before I end up losing them lol."
S A Froelich,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022",Exactly what I needed,My old hoodie had a tear and needed to be replaced.  This new one is exactly what I needed for cool fall and early winter days. Very soft and comfy over a long sleeve T and the fit was just right.
Vicki H,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",Will he ever take it off?!,"We came to the U.S. from a very warm climate and my husband needed something versatile and not too warm -- this fit the bill perfectly.

Helo_jumper,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 28, 2022",Great Zip-up Hoodie for the Money,"This sweatshirt is (hopefully) identical to one I bought five years ago. I have worn it regularly that entire time and it is still in one piece. No holes. no loose seams, nothing. Just an outstanding value and, for the money, a well-made item. It's on the thinner side and runs a bit small. Nothing fancy but you get more than what you paid for."
Pablo Cosio,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",Great Hoodie,"I always have a black hoodie in my wardrobe, this is my first purchase of one of these from Amazon, I really like it, I know my next one will be the same buy. Fits well, looks good, feels good."
peanut butter,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 18, 2022",Horrible shedding! A laundry nightmare,"These socks shed like crazy! I bought a pack of black for my son a few days ago. Ever since he started wearing them, the lints can be seen everywhere on the floor. When he removes the socks at the end of day, his toes and sole are literally covered with tiny black fiber! It is so bad that he asked me how much the socks costed and if they were really cheap. I should take a photo of that horrible sight to prove my point but I don't want to gross out any readers.I natively thought that after the first wash, maybe things would improve. But no! After having handwashed them (too afraid to throw these in the washer) 3 times back to back using buckets after buckets of water for rinsing, I could still see a layer of black lints floating on the surface of the water.Absolute the worst socks I have ever bought! Although the socks may look and feel pretty nice, the amount of shedding renders them practically useless. Also, since I just bought them, I cannot attest to their durability. But considering the stuff they constantly lose, I would not be surprised to hear that holes start to appear before long."
Amazon Customer,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 27, 2022",Very poor quality product,"I purchased Under Armour socks 4 years ago, very comfortable socks. Well they do wear out, so I bought a package of Under Armour recently and immediately noticed the socks are a lot thinner and after a couple of washes they don't stay up anymore. Will never buy them again, they are now in the rag box."

Joe Poker,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 29, 2022",Disappointing,I can't believe it's so difficult to find a good quality sock! These are not it. Short for a crew sock and worst of all...very little elastic in the upper. It usually takes a few months for socks to fall down to your ankles when you wear them but these did right out of the package. Total disappointment!
Chet Ragsdale,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 3, 2022",For pencil legs,"These socks are great if you have ankles that are #2 pencils. I got the XL and have a size 12 foot.

woody3006,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 23, 2022",Extra large seems to be extra tight.,Extra large sizes are so tight they cut off circulation even with my size 12 foot. Don’t buy if you are looking for socks for larger feet.
BURNWOOD BUSHCRAFT ,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 15, 2022",Not the quality expected,These socks are not the same quality as the same socks found in stores. These are thin and will wear out quickly.
scrahan,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 11, 2022",Might Be Fake,"These are either fake or Under Armour’s quality has drastically diminished. I’ve been a big fan of Under Armour socks for a long time. Fit is usually very good, moisture wicking is amazing, and over construction and durability is second to none. These socks I received are like any $10 set you would get from Walmart. After two weeks the elastic is loose and I can see my skin from under the socks when they are on. What happened? Hopefully these are just knock off’s because I’ve always enjoyed UA’s quality."
redne,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 31, 2022",Thread broke after first wash,"Nice, soft fabric but my son didn’t even wear these yet and they came apart in the wash."
Matt,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 18, 2022",Essentially zero durability,"A 6-pack lasted me no longer than a couple months before all pairs - even without very consistent usage - developed many holes around the pressure points. Initially, they were comfortable and intended for exercise, but very soon began leaving cotton behind in my shoes, on my floor, and on my feet. I should note - I have basically never seen this much of a lack of durability before."
Phillip R,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 15, 2022",Wouldn't Buy Again,My initial impression is they won't last. They are comfortable but shed a lot on the inside and outside even after washes. They are thin and a little on the small side which makes them good for everyday wear in both athletic and casual shoes.I'm a fan of UA socks which prompted me to purchase these. We'll see how it goes.I'll post updates
Nicole,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 28, 2022",Sizing is incorrect,"I ordered mediums for my son because the size chart says mens 7-10.5. He wears a 9.5 shoe. When we got them, they say medium 6-8 on the package."
Darrill W Woods,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 10, 2021",Thin fabric,I’ve always bought WigWam socks in the past but lately the elastic has been stretching out of shape and sliding down my ankle. So I decided to try Under Armor socks. When I picked up the package at the front doorstep I thought maybe there was one pair of socks inside. They are very light weight. I ran my hand down one sock and I could see my hand through the sock. These are not what I’m looking for.
Eric Nordquist,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 23, 2022",Not truly oversized !,"Purchased this product for it's ""oversized"" claim.  No bigger in the calf, ankle or foot than regular ""Large or non big/tall men sized socks."
Jake Swezy,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 13, 2022",Socks are smaller than advertised,I have size 11.5 feet and the XL socks I got are so tight around the tops of my ankles that I get sores. I can’t see a size 13 fitting in them.

Harlequin Rose,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 8, 2022","Changed the construction, not necessarily for the better",I've purchased these before and they are now thinner material than before with venting on the upper just above the toes.

The first time I wore them, when I took them off at the end of the day, the heel area had balled up cotton material from the back of the sock. Unbelievably cheap quality if you ask me. I will not buy these again. 3 stars is being genrous."
Arthur Endgaristel,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 6, 2021",Soft and true to size but slippery and lose fuzz,"As expected concerning foot and leg size, very stretchy anyway, padded right for a workout shoe, not a hiking level padding, not thin. The problem is that they are very slippery. Doing sprints I felt like my shoes were coming off (they didn't). For side movements, I don't think they fit the bill. Running may be OK and I will keep them for that, but for tennis or soccer, I think I am going to lose a shoe at some point, and it's a risk for ankles.  I used to think that mostly cotton socks are more sticky than mostly synthetic, but here is the counter-example. Or maybe the 76% cotton is not true, who knows? After my first short run, there was plenty of fuzz stuck to my foot. If that's a sign of low durability, the start is no good."

Who does that?  They attempted to deliver 3 times then they refused to allow anyone under 21 to sign. People actually work for a living and are not home!  This is why we shop online, for convenience!!  This was the opposite! We went to the UPS store 3 times and finally on the 3rd attempt the pants were there. This could have been totally avoided if they didn’t have the signature delivery. Trust me they are not that valuable."
Thriftychick,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 9, 2022",Cheap looking,"Update: After reading a few reviews, it looked like it was only the black color that was having the issue with the cheap looking logo. So I returned the black and bought gray and they ended up being the same. Apparently UA has decided that a couple pieces of thread to create a nice looking logo was just too expensive. I’m sending the gray pair back too. It really looks awful when you look at them up close. UA has really gone downhill fast.My son loves UA so we have a lot of it. I keep seeing the quality decline more and more. These were disappointing to see when they arrived. They look like any old generic brand sweatpants with a super cheap looking UA sticker stuck on them. No stitching or anything, just a sticker that will probably fall off after a couple washes. I got these on a decent sale so we might keep them if they fit, but it’s still very disappointing for an expensive name brand. I would definitely not pay anything close to retail for these. I will also think twice before ordering anymore UA brand."

Matthew,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 25, 2020","Good product, overpriced. Fits small.","I got these along with a couple other brands of fleece pants. The best value (by far) is the Amazon Essential brand. All three brands feel like they have identical fleece material. The Amazon Essential fleece is just as thick and soft as the Under Armour fleece.As expected, the Under Armour runs way too small. This is my biggest problem with pants like this. Since I have acid reflux and ulcers, I can't have pressure on my stomach. I'm smack dab in the middle of the BMI for my height. I wear jeans with a 34 waist, and they're baggy. I'm considered 'skinny', and get compliments on my physique all the time. So I bought 'Large' to be absolutely certain that there would be no pressure on my waist. My true size is a medium in most clothing lines -- I wear a men's medium in shirts across the board.You expect a Men's 'Large' to be what it is in every other brand...LARGE. For me, these should fit baggy, and then be held up by the waist band string. These pants are not large guys. If you're used to buying regular clothing, buy a size too big (or two) - but then they may be too long for you. So maybe just avoid this brand, unless you're a twink. They're supposed to fit a waist of up to 36-38. HA! I wear 34 jeans (and they're loose) and these things crush me.I definitely recommend the Amazon Essential fleece pants over these. And for the price, you could have 3 pairs of those, for the cost of one of these. Ridiculous.I'd give these Under Armour pants 4 stars...but....-1 star overpriced-1 star sized for women, but advertised for menSo that equates to a two star rating for me. Avoid."

jabmom,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 10, 2021",Beware of possible fake items mixed in with authentic,"I bought 3 colors of the “same” pants from this listing on Amazon on the same day. All 3 were shipped and sold by Amazon. However, as you can see in the photos these are not the same pants. The ones listed as “black (001)/ Onyx White” are not the same as the blue and grey ones I received.  The Under Armour logo is sewn on and the seams are different on the blue and grey. The black pair just have a heat transfer sticker for the logo. I have bought these exact pants from a sporting goods store in the past and those have the sewn on logo. I question whether the ones with the other logo are authentic or not. If you look closely at the photos in the listing you can see that some of the logos are sewn on and some are not. That said, even the ones that may be fake appear to be very soft and decent quality. I’m just not 100% sure they are actually Under Armour brand pants. They were cheap enough that I will probably keep them anyway because the black ones listed with the sewn on logo cost a lot more than I paid for the fake ones. Just check the photos in the listing closely and be aware that the ones without the sewn on logo may be fake."

Dmitry Fentsik,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 14, 2021",Stylish looking garbage,"Good: the jacket looks great, the size is as stated, the color of the product in the photo matches what was sent. This is where the positive qualities end.Bad:1. The material and the lining are so loose that even not a strong wind will pierce you through.2. The jacket does not retain heat well, I'll tell you straightforwardly: you will be freezing even in 20F.3. The jacket _instantly_ gets wet from even slightly wet snow (not rain, friends, snow!).4. The hood straps work very poorly - it's almost a decoration.5. External side pockets are very bad: located uncomfortable for warming hands there, shallow, with a wide socket, as a result anything will easily fall out, and something big, like winter gloves, just will not hold there at once.6. Inside pockets, where it would be convenient to put documents, wallet, smartphone... are absent!You can not just go out of the house in this jacket - you need something, some kind of bag to take with you at least a smartphone.The breast pockets are such size that they do not really hold anything, plus, despite the fact that the pocket closes with a button, the material of closing lid is so soft that when you bend over, it will just fold off and everything from the breast pocket will fall to the ground.7. Very, very fragile material. Getting into the car belly pressed lower side of the jacket to the steering wheel ... And part of the jacket with a pocket - just teared off the ""back"" of the jacket! And the tear is not along the seam - just on the side of the jacket - a huge, ~six inch+, tear in the fabric! From a slight squeeze and drag!... God knows how much I love the design, the look, the ""sound"" of this jacket.Oh, how I would love to use it... but the manufacturers have done everything to make that impossible."

I went to zip it shut on the second day and three of the zipper teeth fell off and the zipper pull went with it.  I have never seen that happen on any jacket of this price.. I promptly ordered a replacement up and hoping the new one will be able to handle zipping and unzipping.. fingers crossed!Edit:  Second jacket came in, It is not the same size as the first Large Tall.

Carol Wallace,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 24, 2022",An average jacket,"I washed it once in cold water and dried it using low heat but the flannel shrunk quite a bit and now the inside of the jacket hangs lower than the outside.  The string for the hood came completely out so I recommend you tie knots at both ends so the string does not come out.  Also, I found it retarded that the side pockets were sewn at the seam on both sides of the jacket so in order to use the pockets you have to have arms that bend behind your back in order to use them....so cheap of the company to put unusable pockets on a fairly expensive jacket.  The jacket is extremely warm so I will keep it instead of cutting it up for dust rags."

noah novotny,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 6, 2022",Not rugged enough,I was hoping this wood be a thick flannel that would provide some wind protection as well as being able to withstand walking through sticks and brush. Unfortunately the outer flannel is very thin and there is a puffy under layer of poly fill as the filling. It feels really light and cheap. The waist is also fairly thin so it doesn’t wear very easily (I’m skinny myself). Another gripe is that the buttons aren’t snaps so it takes forever to take on and off. Based on the reviews and price I was expecting better.
Pete,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 4, 2022",Zipper AND Buttons,Has to be zipped and buttoned to close. Hood is short so the weight of the jacket hangs on top of yer head and overall it seems a bit small for a size large.

SomeGuyOnAmazon,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 6, 2020",Fits well as long as I don't move my arms,"The arm/shoulder areas are way too tight and the pockets are a bit ackwardly placed. I am 5'10"" with an average runners build, and usually wear a medium, sometimes a large. When it comes to jackets I usually go for a large if it is a casual jacket, so that it will be a bit looser, or a 42R if it is a suit jacket. Unfortunately, this jacket in a large does not work for me. If I put on the jacket and stand perfectly still it looks like a perfect fit. If I move my arms at all then the armpit area gets too tight and the sleeves start crawling up my forearms. The feel of the jacket at that point is more like an ill-fitting suit jacket than a casual jacket. If I am driving, the sleeves are halfway up my forearms. If I extend a hand over the opposite shoulder to put on my seatbelt, the sleeves are halfway up my forearms. If I bend down to tie my shoe, you guessed it ... the sleeves are halfway up my forearms. Pretty much any movement of my arms results in the same thing. The outer width of the shoulder area is just right, but the inner size is just too small I guess. Another annoying thing about the fit is the location of the side pockets. While most jackets have pocket openings slightly to the front of your mid-hip, this jacket has the pockets directly on the mid point of the hip which requires me having to throw my shoulders back a bit like I'm trying to push out my chest (which makes the armpit area too tight and thus uncomfortable), and then I can slide my hands into the pockets. I have never had this issue with any other jacket, sweatshirt, etc. Maybe I just got a defective item.As far as the other aspects of the jacket, it is lgiht weight, warm, and looks nice."

But it looked really bad considering what I paid for it. I trimmed some of the loose threads and im just going to have to see how well this actually holds up.  So far, looks alone are far from impressive. However I did try  it on and it seemed to fit well and is comfortable. But as I said earlier im not really confident in this particular hooded flannel so far. I will add to this more or change if it holds up to a wash and wear. I hate leaving a bad review, but this is exactly why we have reviews."
D. Tatum,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022","nice jacket, but shrinks a lot after first drying","i really like this jacket.  it seems well made, soft and warm, and i like the convenience of a zipper vs just buttons.  compared to most other hoodies that have massive hoods that balloon out when facing the wind, this hood is nice and compact.unwashed it fit perfectly, lots of length in the arms, not overly tight in the shoulders.  unfortunately after the third wash, and first drying, it shrank maybe 3/4""-1"" in the sleeves, and maybe 1/4""-1/2"" around the chest.  i bought an XL TALL; i am 6'2"", 46"" chest, long arms.  it is nice to have an option for XL TALL if it really is tall, and i would NOT want to see how XL REGULAR fits.like almost all my tops, i will wear it, but continue to have cold wrists."
Dave,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 19, 2022","Nice, comfortable.",Soaks up water if it’s raining or wet snow. I like the fit and it is comfortable. I only wore it a few times and one of the buttons came off.  I had to sew it back on and sewing is not my thing so that was not fun!  A couple others look a little loose so I’ll add some extra thread so they won’t fall off. Other than that I like it.
jack d.,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 5, 2022",Not true to size,"Love the style and the warmth, I’d love to give 5stars, but the sizing is way off.Per their measurements chart, I’m swimming in the jacket, but the arm measurement is correct, so I’m going to try going down a size and getting the “Big&Tall” so I don’t loose the arm length.Wearing an oversized hoodie (also a 50” chest) underneath, the jacket is still 3-4” oversized in the chest and waist.Maybe I just got an odd one?I’m gonna have to return it and try again, it’s just too big."
Linda M,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 2, 2022",Sewn well and quality.,"First one we bought was not great because the seam between the flannel and shell came apart in the first wash, but they sent another and it has been great! Nice product"
Torbjorn Tonnessen,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 17, 2022",Button just fell off when buttoning it up.,"This was a gift for my son.  I really liked it, but as my son went to put it on the button just fell off as he went to button it up.  So, we had to sow it back on.  There were others that weren't attached really well so we sew those on as well.  Maybe get a quality control person to have them look it over.  There is no reason why 4 buttons should be falling off a brand-new shirt.  Other than this he loved it and said it is comfortable and loved the colors. This was for the Legendary Whitetails Men's Maplewood Hooded Shirt Jacket."
Christopher,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 15, 2022",Light weight and warm enough for winter weather.,"Didn't like some lose threads sticking out, no inside pockets. It be awesome if it came with a few spare buttons. I did like the zipper seems sturdy. I feel like it's not quite worth 74  or 80 more like 50 dollars."
Dave C,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 21, 2022",Comfy jacket,"Decent late autumn jacket. As long as it’s dry outside. It looks really good, but I wouldn’t wear it into the woods. It’s not the most durable material. I feel like the first time I try to squeeze through a buckthorn thicket, the jacket will be cut to shreds. Not a bad jacket if you want to take a walk in the country and plan on keeping to the trails."
Nate Wolfe,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 27, 2022","Fits true, warm & thick - nice jacket","True to size, I'm 6' 1"", 210lbs avg build, I like my clothes comfortable, but not baggy... XLT was a good fit for me.Nice thick material, very nice fall jacket, easily can be used in very cold / winter Temps."
AR,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 28, 2022","Thin, lightweight","Loved the look, fit, and feel. Just too lightweight/thin for my purpose. Think of this as sweater thickness. Not coat like."
Amazon Customer,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 30, 2022",Wish sleeves longer,I had bought the orange for my son. I decided to buy one for me. The small arm length was a little short and jacket almost snug. I am 5’7”
Arok5,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 11, 2022",Amazing jacket!,"I had been searching for something like this for a long time and came up short so many times both in store and online. Either didn’t look right or fit oddly or was too heavy or not heavy enough. FINALLY I found the perfect jacket I was looking for. Stylish, well made, warm, perfect fitting and incredibly comfortable. Can’t recommend this more!"
Audrey,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 6, 2022",LOVE THIS JACKET,"where i live, we have some pretty brutal winters and this jacket is all i need to stay completely warm for hours in sub-zero temperatures. it blocks the wind and keeps me dry when it’s snowing or sleeting. it’s also SUPER cute! i would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a cute, good quality, winter coat."
Enrique,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 6, 2022",Very comfortable,"I really like these jackets, I bought 2 of them. I use them daily, the color mix hides dog hair, love the double hoody and outside jacket. Seems like good quality, not warm enough for Alaska but good enough for 30 degrees and above."
M&N,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 15, 2022",Amazing jacket ... terrible pockets,"Haven't had this 'shirt jac' long but I quite like it thus far. I'm new to the world of flannel and purchased this particular orange pattern--not just because it is appealing--but to serve as a semi-high visibility option for work. The jacket is attractive, comfortable, and looks well made. As seems to be commonplace with this brand's products, the jacket is slightly oversized, so it's advisable to purchase one size down from your normal size. In my case XL is slightly too big, but I'm sticking with it as I want a jacket to be roomy rather than snug. The one major flaw is the terrible and nonsensical pockets, which are placed way too far back at the side seams, probably as a cost cutting measure that makes sewing these quicker and cheaper. I'm definitely looking to buy another, though the price will have to come WAY down, as this purchase was made on a sale, and the standard price tag is far too high for my sensibility. Fully recommend Legendary Whitetails."
Katie,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 25, 2022",Love this for all activities,"I received this shirt as a gift. I love it. I wear it around the house. I wear it to walk to the dogs. I wear it to the store. I typically like it as a jacket, to wear over my other clothes. It is very warm and the hood is nice too for extra warmth. I am thinking of getting another as a gift for a friend."
Pat,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022","Roomy, comfortable and warm.",Was a good between season jacket. Warm and comfortable. Like the zip up with bottoms if desired. A 2x fit well.
SABRINA TOSO,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 24, 2022","The ""Awesomest"" thing i own!!","Great light jacket! Perfect for any occasion. Id wear it to a wedding and a funeral. I think ill stick to chilly day outside chores. Im just saying its really comfy. Even took a power nap wearing it. Soft and cozy. Could use more pockets. Good golly its a nice jacket type thing for MN. Geez i tell ya, its great. I cant wait to wear it into fleet farm and have the heads turn my way as they silently mouth ""thats a nice jacket flannel thing!"" They would then slow motion daydream of happily doing outside things while wearing one just like it. And i will happily tell them, Thanks, its a Legendary Whitetails flannel jacket thing."" I might just rake some leaves in this thing right now, thats what a man needs to do. Then chase the task with a cold beer. Then i think ill make the journey to the fleetest of farms and show it off. Probably going to buy another at some point."
JOE,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 5, 2022",Love this jacket,I love these white tail jackets. If you have somewhat broad shoulders than they’re kinda a pain to put on but overall they’re comfortable and keep you warm.
Papasince88,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 21, 2022",Warm,"A little in the bulky side fair warning if u like things more fitted order a smaller size but it’s warm and does the job wel and looks great , just wish it had Inside pockets lol so to the tailor I go."
Kevin Gee,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022",Great fit and quality!,My son loves this jacket.
thrasher,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 13, 2022",webpage color did not match actual color,"It was a great hoodie; nice fit, Carrhart quality, etc. But the color was not what I saw on the webpage.  What I saw was a not-so-dark neutral gray.  What I got had a darker gray with a slight reddish hue (see image) and not what I wanted.  Returns are easy but knowing what color I'm going to get is impossible, hence the one star.I thought about exchanging for a ""Heather Gray"",  which is too light - hoping it would be darker too - but I  am too fed up with inaccurate descriptions online."
John,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",Tried and returned.,"I have a couple of Carharrt sweatshirts and love them. One is heavy and has a warm lining, the other is heavy but unlined but very warn and tattered so I thought I treat myself to a new one. This was not the same. This was a really light weight sweatshirt, the one I have a heavier but does not have a heavy lining. This one listed in just a light weight average sweatshirt."
Jack,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 25, 2022",50% Cotton 50% Polyester,"Amazon item description is deceptively saying ""100% Cotton"".Upon receiving and opening package the actual label on the Sweater reads ""50% Cotton 50% Polyester"".Returned it back to them.The Amazon item description is deceptive.Talked to live amazon customer service. They have to fix it!"
Oregonerd,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 3, 2022",Buyer beware! This material is nothing like the older models. Another brand is biting the dust?,"Probably a change in management, the CEO got a raise? Paid for by diminishing quality? Well the quality in the rain defender's material has apparently been downgraded. I have attached a picture of my 2 year old rain defender and my 6 month old rain defender. I crawl in, around, under, over, on dirt, gravel and asphalt repairing RV's. The one with the bleach spots I tortured more in the first 6 months than the new one whose material is balling up. I hit ORDER on the old style but Amazon pop up offered me this new model instead (with try free, if you like it pay for it $20 less). Well at first I did like it, it fit well. I had no idea the difference in the material. If you are a hard working in the grit person, save $20 and wear it around the house. If you work hard, don't bother. Time to find the next brand. Looks like Carhartt is buying it's material from Levi's now. Too bad."
Michael Mayovsky,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 6, 2022",They changed the hood!!!,"Carhartt chose to lesson the quality of the hooded jacket by changing the quality of the hood. Its a thin cheap piece of cloth to save money and pull a fast one on the consumer. I called Carhartt and asked about the change and they said since there was no ""defect"" in the jacket they could do nothing about. Unfortunately my return window back to Amazon has closed. Carhartt you lost a great customer and many others once they realize you changed the quality of your brand to save some $$$. Shame on you!!!!"
Amazon Customer,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 8, 2022",Not 100% cotton,"They lied in the description. I specifically searched for 100% cotton, they said it was. This is the same old cheap 50% polyester crap. Sending back immediately."
KansasBornAndBred,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 2, 2021",Zipper broke one day after return window closed,"This review is for - Carhartt Men's Midweight Hooded Zip-front Sweatshirt, Carbon Heather, X-Large and I paid $44.99 plus tax.  Zipper lost two of its horizontal pieces midway up one side (while it was zipped up) yesterday and was one day beyond the return window.  Sweatshirt worn for the first time on Dec 24, 2020 and broke on Feb. 1, 2021.  For a metal zipper this does not seem like it should happen - NOT HAPPY HERE - Sweatshirt was roughly one month old and had not even been washed yet.  I am 6'1 and 210 lbs. and I swim around in this X-Large. Will try a BERNE again as I have had one previous but spilled oil all over it and it didn't wash out well.  It is also an X-large and fits just perfect. The zipper on the BERNE is some sort of plastic but at least it zips up (on the correct side) everyday for a couple years now and has been worn every single day to work. Not a desk job mind you.  I am a mechanic and work on cars."
Amazon customer,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 19, 2022",Product did notmatch picture as shown on Amazon,The order picture showed the Carhartt logo on the sleeve. There was so logo on this  sweatshirt sleeve !
Chris S. Corniola,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 22, 2022",Not 100% cotton- false claim,When first reading the description this product material is stated as 100% cotton. I didn’t scroll down enough to see that it is later stated to be 50% cotton. Why write a confusing description? Not everyone will necessarily think they need to read a detailed description since it is just a sweatshirt. Stop confusing people. I returned this plastically feeling piece of clothing.
Konstantin,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 16, 2022",It's wrong fabric quality,I was looking for a long time 100% cotton but this one in only 50% cotton. The price is not for this quality. Waste time and money.
beth,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 9, 2022",Looks quality but falls apart fast,"Initially, I was unsure about this hoodie because the outside was rough in texture but that did soften up after washing and I did like the quality craftsmanship. The sewing quality was impressive, mostly all triple sewn, no loose threads, and done better than majority name brand hoodies I've had. The inside was a thin fleece,it also had a nice metal zipper,wide 3-peice hood, and a hanger hook. Im a female 160lbs with curvy hips and I got a men's small which was plenty big enough, but it did sit lower but snug around hips when zipped.It didn't look too big tho. It kept me warm with a thin jacket in 40degree weather. BUT..Problems arose after washing it. #1: Fleece inside started pilling after 1st wash, common for hoodies/sweats after years use. 4th wash it was all balled up/gone#2 2nd wash I found hole, used this for non work, this is supposed to be for work though?!#3 The threading around the cuffs, both hoody front & side pockets all started unraveling. It progressively got worse, and this was only in a matter of 3 weeks.Now it made sense why they triple stitch it, either they don't tie the ends or use cheap thread. A $50 hoody should not unravel that fast. They also use extremely cheap inner fleece and material that simply washing created micro holes. I've heard Carhartt quality has gone down cuz they switched manufacturing to a 3world factory using subpar material. I returned for refund and got Columbia & Eddie Bauer hoodies. Columbia was wayyy worse but my EB is great and warmer."
Amazon Customer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 23, 2022",WAY OVERSIZED,"I'm a big guy and wear XXL so naturally, I ordered XXL.  This particular sweatshirt is way over sized...fits more like a XXXXL, yes, 4XL.  Be careful!"

Nate,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 15, 2021",Missed the mark on this one,"Been buying carharrtt for over 20 years for work, always like the products.  This sweatshirt was unfortunately by far the worst fitting to date.  Normally pretty consistent with there products but the mark was missed at least for the one I purchased.Fit very tight, no stretch at all, and extremely long.  Not sure what body type they are supplying this for.  I’m an in between size so it’s always a bit tuff to find the perfect fit. But the quality control on this definitely was missed. Unfortunate when we have to pay a premium price and get a product like this one.  Hope the rest are not the same. This one purchase will not stop me from purchasing more carharrt products."

jaymac,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 12, 2021","Carhartt, What Happened?","As background, I was more than happy with the Carhartt waffle hoodies I've worn for nearly 20 years. When the present set started getting threadbare, I looked again and found that waffles weren't on the menu for medium weight and original fit.The new non-waffle lining isn't as warm, the inner chest pocket is gone, as is the hanging loop, and -- weirdly -- the new ""original fit"" is almost 6"" longer than the old original fit, meaning that when it's unzipped, there's one more interference getting access to the side pouches of a tool belt. Also, the hand pockets are still at the waistband, so if the zipped waistband is hiked up, anything but hands in the pocket is going to obey gravity.This and the other one that got shipped as a separate item are going to a thrift store where somebody 6' 6"" might get some use out of them.Carhartt, I hope you read and heed this."
Amazon reviews,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 22, 2022",Not as described. A little longer than Large.,"The description is 100% cotton made in Mexico. The actual sweatshirt is 50/50 made in Honduras. On Amazon it does show a description that is accurate lower down the page but I'm not sure why it's inaccurate on top. I saw that the manufacturer already responded to a similar question so why not fix it. The sweatshirt itself came with another one made by Amazon. Both size large. The Amazon one was a perfect fit length wise. The Carhartt was longer than a large on the sleeves and overall length. It's also a lot roomier in the belly area where the Amazon one isn't but I expected that from the description.The zipper is a bit heavy and will get stuck because the folds of the longer sweatshirt so two hands are a must. It's not broken, it's just more work to close. I have a similar zipper on a Costco sweatshirt and I am not a fan. Overall mid weight seems the same as basic sweatshirts I wear and not the warm sweatshirt I expected for the price. It will be returned so I will not be able to see if it's more durable than others. I'm waiting on another Carhartt sweatshirt. A heavy one. Hope it is better."
Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",Too big,"Nice, but its huge! We own many Carhartt sweatshirts, got for Son as a gift. All his Carhartts are mediums. Ordered a med. and this one is huge :("

R Keller,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 9, 2022",a little large,Bought a large. I have a 44 waist and a 32 waist. Fits well in chest but really too large and long in torso area. Was afraid medium would be too tight in chest based off of sizing guide. Overall I do like though. Zipper definitely needs improvement. Will see how it holds up.
James W Lee,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 27, 2022",Several things wrong here = Read Review and make your decisions,Worn this now for several months and here is my observations:Nice soft material insideUsual tough feel on outsideBrass zipper is terrible - corners are very sharp on the teeth and catch and snag on everything.Difficult to get started when fully unzipped. - Alignment issues maybe?Hood drawstring is way too short - actually only about 2 to 3 inches longer that the radius of the hood opening leaving almost no string to grab to tighten down on and it creeps up into the hood draw string tube upon washing requiring minor surgery to retrieve it. Very poorly thought out if any thought was applied at all.Sizing seems just a bit large.I ordered my normal XL and it is pretty long hanging to my thighs.Not a big deal as I had my wife wash it several times and it fits nicely now.(She could shrink a hammer)Carhartt appears to be going down the same road as many others with less quality than previously.
T. Robichaux,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 19, 2022","Misleading photo, no center seem hood!",Carhartt most likely does not make a hoody with a center seem (two piece) hood. This listing must be using and old photo. This hood has a three piece hood which means the top part is flat with two seems on either side of top of head.
michael,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 15, 2022",It says loose fit fyi...i didn't see that,Nice big hoodie...hood is kinda large.  Inside is big also and very large front pocket..

robert,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 29, 2022",High end hoodie,"I finally pulled the trigger on buying a Carhartt Midweight Full-Zip Sweatshirt Hoodie. I know, their expensive BUT..given the quality and workmanship of the hoodie Its a bargain. First the material is top notch. Zipper solid and easy to use made of brass(I think) nothing cheap about it at all... the hoodie is slightly loose and long enough that it doesn't ride up on stretching or kneeling over. I dont know much about sewing but from comparing it to a cheaper hoodie i have, this sewing was done with care and crafted nicely. The overall fit is spot on!! I usually order xlarge but the large was a perfect fit all around. This hoodie is medium warm without being overly hot, wind doesn't pass through it and it's light weight to boot. In fact, I'll be getting another one to phase out my old crappy ones. Hey, don't believe me, get one yourself, join Amazon prime membership( ya It rocks, and everything is free fast shipping, it's the best value out there and pays for itself very fast)) and get it on 7-day trial."
J peters,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 2, 2022",Love it,"Nice quality and looks really good.A major improvement in the looks department over lesser brands.Very comfortable as well. This model fits  a little snug in the butt area which is fine for me. I bought a medium as I am 6ft 152lbs and it fits nice.This sweat shirt is not heavy weight, and you might need a heavier shirt underneath in really cold weather or if you’re prone to always being cold like me. I always wear a vest over it on really cold days."
Chooch Harangue,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022","I've cheated on Carhartt a couple of times, but luckily she keeps taking me back!","You get what you pay for, plain and simple. Sure you could buy another hoodie for 1/2 or even 2/3rds less, but I guarantee you'll be sorry. I have Carhartt hoodies still in rotation from 5 years ago, and they're all I wear in the winter, be it for work or whatever."
Gregory Heavey,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 2, 2022",Size is accurate!,"I typically buy hoodies a size up since I'm 6'-2"", but this one is dead on for size. With a large my seeves stay at my hands when extended forward which usually is not the case.  Normally I'd go for a XL, but would have far too baggy with Carhartt.  I'm about 190 lbs so a large was a perfect fit."
Amazon Customer,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022",A Whole Lot Better Than Most !,A Carhartt sweatshirt is usually priced higher than other brands…but are  well worth  the extra cost—they stay the same fit after many washings and very durable

Kristopher Andrae,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 10, 2022",Great sweatshirt hoodie,It fits great very long which is what I wanted. I can see some of the complaints about the zipper are from drying it unzipped. I always dry my zipper jackets fully zipped up and on low . This keeps the zipper in the right position. Nice thickness and weight to the fabric and very soft but not fuzzy. I have two of the “American Giant” which I love but this was very close if not nicer as it was a better fit.

Daniel J,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 1, 2020",I love these socks!!,"In this review, I'm going to cover the pro's and cons, share my thoughts, and a conclusion. As with all my reviews, this purchase was made with my own money, so this review is 100% unbiased.Pro's:- really soft, supports the foot, and super comfortable.- Snug fit, they stay in place and don't bunch up.- thick cotton, extremely well made. Reinforced toes and heels.Cons:- expensive @ $25One thing I really like about these socks is that they're snug on my feet. I'm not talking about the average fit of normal standard tube socks, but rather a slight squeezing sensation mid foot. It has tighter elastic in that area which provides excellent support and fit. Be mindful these socks are $25 for 8 pairs, but well worth it. While I listed the price as a con, it's mostly because I'm used to paying $12-$15 for socks."
AbulletAway,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 10, 2022",Something's Not Right,"Several years ago while at Costco I purchased 3 bags of these low cut Puma socks. They were amazing. Soft and cushiony. I'm big guy and you could slide them on and it really felt like there was some cushion with each step.Those lasted a long time. But recently I noticed some holes started to show in them. I finally ordered another 3 bags. Great price on here, couldn't wait to get them. They arrived last week but right out of the bag, they felt different. Thinner to the touch maybe, and they have this polyester kind feel to them, maybe a cotton poly blend or something?I wore the first pair, and that comfy, cushion they once had, is no longer there. I was disappointed, but willing to let it go. I spend most of days and night behind a desk, I can deal without the cushion. However, a few hours later, I hear the mail had arrived. I walk outside and down to the curb to get it, and my feet, feel like I'm walking in damp socks. I'm actually sliding a little in my shoes and the slip is making sounds like tiny friction farts.I get back into the house, take off one of my shoes because I know there's no way my feet are sweaty. Sure enough, completely dry. It's just the way these socks are made. They can't be 100% cotton. These are not made the same way they used to be.It's now been 4 or 5 days and each time I put on a new pair, it's the same thing. These look identical to the ones I had before. But, they are not the same, these are like knockoffs. Not worth the money, at all. If I hadn't taken them all out of the bags, I would be sending them back.There are more expensive versions of these low cut Puma socks. Maybe those are the good ones? I just know these less expensive PUMA Men's 8 Pack Low Cut Socks are sadly, complete trash. Money is tight, I just can't afford to get new socks again. So, I'm sadly stuck with these for a while. However, you don't have to be. Maybe try the more expensive Puma socks or just get another brand.Hope this helps."

Jeff Gomske,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 12, 2022",Wished I Had Gone With A Different Pair,"Okay...first off, I really hate low-rise socks. HATE them. Now, why would I go ahead and purchase them? Stupidity for one. I went off reviews and the photo of the socks, which I might point out, do not show them as being low-rise socks. Let me say that again, the photo of these particular socks are NOT the kind I received. Is it too much to ask to match the photo with the product you are ordering?Okay...with that said, the product clearly does state these are low-cut socks and I ordered them anyway, so that is 100% on me. I am not trying to get out of my part in all of this. Were this my only problem, I would actually still like them. Unfortunately, I received 3 socks in the bunch that were Puma socks, but did NOT match the other 5. They were lower by at LEAST three-quaters of an inch and the pattern simply was OBVIOUSLY different. Not sure why I got screwed here, but those 3 are lower enough that wearing them is virtually impossible for me because they slip down to my heel no matter HOW often I pull them up. Honestly, even though they are low-cut socks, the other 5 still stay put and I would have given 5 stars had they at least all matched. This was HUGELY annoying. I honestly feel cheated...whether by Puma or amazon I don't know which...but since they were packaged and sealed I tend to side with amazon on this. Puma simply sorted their socks incorrectly and included 3 that did not match the others. Sure, it's a mistake, but I don't feel that I ought to pay for that miscalculation.Puma...please correct this issue and I would be thrilled to give you a 5 star review. The socks genuinely earned it - were it not for this astonishingly annoying anomaly."

TechnoBob,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 24, 2022","Okay, but too many loose threads","These Puma ankle socks are okay, but there is one thing I don't like.  The picture shows the inside of the socks.  There are many, many loose threads inside.  Some of them are loops of threads, just waiting to catch your toes.If you try to slip your foot into these, you are likely to catch your toes on these loops of threads.  If keep pulling, either your toes will bend, or the threads will start to pull, which isn't good for longevity.You can avoid this problem by rolling the socks down, and sticking your toes into the toe end of the sock, and then rolling the sock up your foot.  It works, but it's not the way I put my socks on, so I don't like this issue.The socks were also just a bit smaller than I would like.  If you wear a man's size 12 or 13 shoe, they may be a bit small for you as well.  Okay, but a bit smaller than I would like.Comfort while wearing these was okay, nothing special.  The price per pair was good, so it is a fair deal, but again, not a great deal."
mike,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 27, 2022",Poor packaging,There are a ton of plastic ties that bind them together and many are dug into the fabric. At least one pair developed a hole right away. Price is really low so it does make up for some of it. Socks fit and perform fine so far.

They seem to be made well, but we will see in time how they last. I am pretty rough on socks. But out of the bag, they are comfortable. However, that said, they claim they fit size 10-13. I wear a size 11.5-12 shoe (depending on shoe), and they seem to fit snuggly on my feet. I think they fit, I prefer them to fit snug myself, but If I happed to have size 13, I don't think I would be able to get my foot in them. Just sayin, so take that in consideration.

I wear a shoe size of 11 and, while I can ""fit"" into them, it is only with great effort (I almost had to enlist the help of a shoe horn and some dishwashing liquid).And getting them on is where the real problem begins.These socks are so tight if you are in the upper end of the 6.5-12 spectrum then you can't wear them for more than a few minutes at a time before losing almost all feeling and circulation in your feet and ankles. I believe these socks would be a valuable addition to any hiking trips to the desert to be used as an emergency tourniquet in the event of a rattlesnake bite.Barring a chance encounter with a venomous snake, no adult man should ever own a pair of these incredibly tight and tiny socks."

I bought this hoodie April 2022 with anticipation the cost would increase in the fall/winter time. I used it twice in April and put it away for the up and coming colder months.A cold spell has arrived and I broke out the new Carhartt zip up hoodie. I washed it and used it for two days straight. On the third day I noticed it was difficult to zip up and by the end of the day it would not zip up at all. A dam shame.I had an old Carhartt zip up hoodie for about 8 years and the Zipper never failed me, but that hoodie's zipper was heavy duty in size and ruggedness and I assumed the new one would have the same quality zipper, wrong. I shouldn't be surprised that quality is down and cost is up up up.I am going to try to return this hoodie but not feeling optimistic."

Ryan,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2020",Material pilling after 3 washes,"Slightly disappointed with this purchase. I got a large tall (6'1"" 175lb) and while the jacket is longer than normal, it seems the tall is more designed for folks with a large belly. The front of the jacket comes down past the boys but the back doesn't quick cover my butt. So now I have a cold butt.Also, after only 3 washes, the material is starting to pill. I expected better from a trusted brand like Carhartt."
Chris H,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 18, 2016",but these are not comfortable. I think it's going to come down to ...,"Sizes are all wacky.  I am 6'1, 215, somewhat athletic build (I work out consistently, but I also drink beer).  Anyway, I originally ordered an XL, which is the size I wear in every other hoodie, t-shirt, long-sleeve t-shirt, sweater, what have you.  It fit me as if it were made for Andre The Giant.  No problem.  Amazon has free returns.  I order a Large.  It shows up, and while the arm lengths are long enough, the elastic bands around my wrists are constricting, as is the waist elastic.  It's going to get returned, too.  Maybe I am just used to every other cheap hoodie I've ever worn in my life, but these are not comfortable.  I think it's going to come down to just going to a store if I am to purchase any kind of Carhartt hoodie.  At least the returns are free, but fall is approaching, and I'm wasting time with these particular items."
willy,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 2, 2017",Not So Heavyweight,"I ordered this in an XL even though I normally wear L.  I wanted a loose fit with room for layering.  The fit was fine and well proportioned, a little longer than expected but that was okay for what I wanted.  The problem with this sweatshirt is that it really isn't all that ""heavyweight"", even though that's how it's described by the manufacturer.  Without an inner lining, it feels lighter than the Rutland Thermal Lined sweatshirt which I had already purchased and returned to buy this one (the Rutland would have been perfect for me if the lining material hadn't been so rough and uncomfortable, especially around the neck).  So, I also returned the Paxton.  Too bad.  I really wanted to like either of these sweatshirts, due mainly to the way they fit and looked."
W. Davis,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 26, 2017",Too short,"The sweatshirt is well made and of a very high quality, but it is too short for its size. I can't raise my arms without my belly button being exposed and that's no good when wearing it out in the cold. I ordered this is size 4xl. OMy Carhartt jacket which is a 4xl (not tall) is long enough, so I thought this would have a similar fit, but it did not, so I had to return it because they don't make a 4xlt in this sweatshirt and no one (even Carhartt) stocks the 5xl, even though it is listed by the manufacturer as a size on their website.Too bad, because I really like it. I can't find anyone else who makes a high quality heavyweight metal zipper, full zip up hoodie with DWR coating in big & tall sizes."
Suzanne,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 21, 2021",Shrunken Heads Hoodie,"I bought this similar type of hoodie in the women's sizing. I didn't like it because the fabric blend is higher in polyester than cotton and not rain defender. However, the hood on the women's is waayyy better. But, there is that plastic pilling up under the arms which I detest because you after such a short time you look like a homeless person in a $50 garment.  Why does Carthartt want us to represent like this?I'm 5'2"" and this men's hoodie in a small is not too much bigger than the women's version in medium (8/10) relaxed fit. This men's arms are longer and the torso length is longer, but I don't hate it so far. It feels baggy and cozy. I'm banking on the other one woman who left a review saying it shrinks up after washing. Fingers crossed.The biggest thing I hate is the hood. I can't wrap my mind around the fact that the highlight of this purchase, it's very name that attracts us..... HOODIE .... and it's better fit for people with shrunken heads.  If you have a pinhead this will be absolutely perfect for you. The rest of us will suffer with our apparently fat gigantic oversized skulls. At a whopping 5'2"" this ""hoodie"" barely comes to my forehead, and absolutely doesn't even work if I have my hair up in a clip.  The women's version I can still wear the hood  even with my hair in a clip. It's a tiny bit awkward but doable. Absolutely not happening in the men's version. Want to wear your giant headphones and the hood? Get the women's.  The men's hood is effing useless. I am not sure what to even use it for? It doesn't stay up.  But I guess I could use the drawstrings to cinch it up around my face like a three year old. Again, why does Carthartt want us to represent like this?I can't even really think of this as a hoodie. I consider it mis-titled because of it's uselessness. It's just an aesthetic we're paying for. I can't imagine why we're being forced to pay for a hoodie that doesn't even work. The sizing to the body of the garment is funhouse mirror specifications. Super disappointed.WHHHYYYY Carthartte?  You are a distinguished brand. Why would you do this to us? I swear, if the hood was an actual hood I would buy many many more from you, especially because it's 75% cotton.  I want a $15 discount for the lack of material in this hood. This shrunken heads hoodie should cost like $30, not $45 or higher. :(So in conclusion, if you want a hoodie with an actual hood, buy the women's plastic pilling version that'll look worn out in a matter of months.Or, you can buy the men's version with a higher cotton blend, rain defender, but a hood that makes all that rain defense useless because your head is still going to get wet unless you have other head gear to keep you covered. They should've just made this a regular sweatshirt instead of ripping us off. But I guess that's the corporate way now days."
Austin P.,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 15, 2022",Decent sweatshirt ruined by cheap features,"I'm a commercial fisherman, and always looking for a better sweatshirt. The fit of this one is good, and it is very warm.  As advertised, it will keep you dry in modest conditions - fog , drizzle or occasional spray.  Then Carhartt wrecks a pretty good product with some cheap, penny saving features.  The metal zipper is way too small - about the size you would find on jeans.  Its hard to engage with bare hands and will be impossible with gloves.  It should be a nylon zipper twice the size.And the cord for cinching the hood is about 10"" too short.  The first time I washed it (NO dryer) both ends retracted back into the hood.  I fished them out and put a knot on either side which prevents them from retracting into the hood, but leaves little for the knot under you chin.In my opinion Carhartt saved $.50 in manufacturing costs, and ruined a pretty good product."
Paul Osmond,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 7, 2022","Works ok, but suspect counterfeit","This hoodie seems to be made well enough, but I have a sneaking suspicion that it’s a counterfeit Carhartt hoodie. There are little things about it that flag me. I have 2 other ones that are pullover ones, and love them.  The color on this one faded too much after the 1st washing and pilled up a lot. The cuffs and waistband wrinkled a bit and the drawstrings were thinner in diameter and one side got sucked up into the hood. That’s never happened with either of my previous two. All of them are the thicker heavier rain defenders hoodies.  Carhartt has pretty good quality control. I am not sure if the zippered hoodie “should” have the small rain defender decal on the left sleeve like the pullovers, but this one doesn’t have it. I saw some other models at a box store recently, and the fabric and paper labels looked similar enough, but something seemed off. I’d be surprised if Carhartt dropped their standards. It works well enough as a work jacket, but I’d be wary. This was sold through Amazon, LLC."
Dianna,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 3, 2022",Covered in dog hair,"We like this jacket. It's a little on the big side. Fabric is not thick but it's heavy. Does a great job of repelling rain.BUT.Although sold as new, it was absolutely covered in dog hair, inside and out. There was a definite ick factor and we had to wash it before even trying it on. This jacket should have been sold as used. Come on, Amazon, can you not do better than that? And seriously, folks, if you're trying on clothes in the comfort of your own home, could you at least make an effort not to share your filth? Just basic common courtesy."

This fits well, matter of fact I should have gone a size down, sleeves are more than long enough and I probably couldve gone xl or large since it fits kind of big, but its all good, its so heavy and soft and warm I have yet to have have to wear the carhart coat I purchased because i was so impressed with the hoodie. For context I live in Michigan where this time of year its 30-35 degrees in the AM, buy it, Im buying one for my tall skinny son so I dont have to see him in the short sleeved hoodies he currently wears."

Uncle Jason Bob,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 6, 2021",Quality product- runs large - not as heavy as I would have thought.,"I purchased the full zip hoodie to wear under my motorcycle vest in the Spring and Fall evenings/mornings.  It's been in the low 60s and this is barely warm enough on a bike (so 50ish after calculating for the wind).  It does seam to keep me dry on the high humidity/misty days.  I'm normally a 2x (5'10"" 250 lb) and sized down to an xl which is a little on the big side and definitely on the long side but the large was just a tad to tight but perfect in length.  It will probably work great in colder weather under my jacket but it's just not as warm as I had hoped."
April,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 23, 2020",Very functional,"Durable, repels water, and warmer than a standard hoodie while still as comfortable as one. Will require layers underneath on colder days, as it will not get you through winter by itself.I am a woman who bought this for myself, so I will include fit info for other women or people with smaller proportions. This thing is made for men with the build of a lumberjack apparently: surprisingly roomy in the shoulders and upper chest. I regularly get men's outdoor stuff because it's more durable, comfortable, and I can easily layer underneath, so it feels more exaggerated than usual menswear. That said, you can very easily layer under it without feeling claustrophobic or shrink-wrapped. If you are in fact not a lumberjack like me, but you want something more for comfort and warmth than a perfect, stylish fit, then this thing is lovely to have in the late fall and winter. Oh, and the last time the power went out and there was no heat in the house, I wore this thing around and slept in it overnight because it's just so comfortable."
John,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 11, 2022","Great jacket, size down","This jacket is nice and cozy for a cold day, I live in California and I would imagine the most I would need to do is layer a light hoodie under it. I would say size down, I heard that Carhartt designed this jacket to be the outer part of multiple layers, so they made it larger. I'm roughly 6 feet tall, wear a 38R for suit jackets, and usually wear size medium/large for clothing. I ordered a size small for this jacket and it fits perfectly on me, not too big not too small. The waist part of the jacket hugs you pretty tight, which I believe is to keep insulation. It doesn't look funky, but it definitely is something you will notice when you first put on the jacket. I find that I'm constantly adjusting the jacket because it slightly rides up when I'm walking because of how tight the bottom is. This obviously isn't a problem when you wear the jacket unzipped. There is a mini hidden pocket inside of the right pocket on the jacket, which is the perfect size to fit an iPhone (non max model) inside of it. The material on this jacket definitely feels high quality.I would say this jacket is suitable for anything above 50 degrees, nothing less."
Jeremiah,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 17, 2022",Worth the Money,"This is the best sweatshirt I have ever owned and its currently my favorite item of clothing. It fits perfectly. It's heavy without being cumbersome. It breathes wonderfully (a feature that isn't hyped up in the description but is definitely appreciated) and it is actually very water resistant (not waterproof, but then...it's a sweatshirt so not sure why would expect that anyway). It is loose without being bulky. Would easily fit under a jacket. It's tough and designed for people who work for a living. I sit at a desk and still love it.I'm not a huge fan of labels and the Carhartt label placement is aesthetically not great, but a few seconds with an exacto knife and I've got a sweatshirt that I plan on wearing for a good portion of the rest of my life. Yes its expensive, but you get quality with the price. The only other complaint I have is that the inner lining flakes off in little black pieces of lint, but a single washing solved this. It's not a flaw so much as an aspect of the design and manufacturing of the product. Wash it in cold water and let it hang dry. After that...no little fuzzballs over your shirts.Seriously, I LOVE THIS SWEATSHIRT."
Debra H,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 3, 2022",Quality Hoodie,I was searching high and low for a tall hoodie sweatshirt for my boyfriend.  He usually has issues with the sleeve length.

Prime Shopper,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 13, 2022",Horrible Seam Alignment!,"The last two orders of these boxers that I've made have both had the same issue...horrible seam alignment. Straight out of the bag you can notice that the front seam does not match up with the back seam, resulting in a very uncomfortable fit where the if the front in centered, as it should be (even light to either side by a few cm), the back seam ends up in the middle of either of your butt cheeks. Hanes really needs to do better quality control on their products. It would be one thing if it was just one or two in a pack, but every single pair was like that in both of the past recent purchases. It's a shame because these were a go to for me and would recommend, but now I can't say that I would recommend, nor will I be purchasing again."

The hard texture itches your skin. The legroom is very weird; I try to open my legs and boom my trunk comes out. You honestly get what you pay for.

Dave Maynard,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 15, 2022",I don’t know what I am missing here,"I hardly ever leave negative reviews, but I just don’t like how these fit at all. I’m 5’9” 145lbs thin athletic build, but these boxers stretch in the crotch in a standing position and are just an odd fit. I don’t usually have an issue with fit, and don’t mean this to disparage the product. Clearly people like them, they just didn’t fit my body type well. I don’t like them loose/baggy but these were a good length and waist, just super tight and stretched on the inseam for me."

Sunny,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 6, 2022",Not soft enough for me,"Although I like the style and colors, these Hanes boxers are just not soft enough for me.  The heather (75% cotton) colored ones (2 in my package) are not soft at all to me, while the solid (100% cotton) ones (3 in my package) are definitely softer, but they're nothing compared to the softness of my Eddie Bauer jersey knit boxers, which are oh-so-soft."

David B,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 15, 2022",Major Quality Control Issues,"Waistband and fabric are soft and comfortable but as you can see by the pic, the size and length is totally inconsistent. Both of these came from the same package.

C. Lew,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 9, 2021",waistband stretches over time!,"I purchased a couple of packs over time.  The first was not tagless, from Walmart and came with horizontal stripe patterns.  The 2nd was from Amazon and these were solid (preferred).  I do not think you really get a choice, luck of the draw.  Some models are the ""exposed waistband"" and others ""comfort flex..."".  Regardless of the Hanes marketing hype, the BIG problem with these is after a number of washes and usage, the waistband stretches up to 2 inches and then they start to sag down my waist.  Very annoying.  I am very careful to hang dry these only, and wash in warm (not hot) water.  Hanes should spend another $.10 cents and procure better quality elastic. that lasts and where the boxers maintain their new size.  C'mon Hanes.  I am very slender (size 32)  so maybe this is a unique problem.  At this point for the boxers to be usable will need to learn to sew to make shorten the waistband a couple inches."

Consumers are really tired of manufacturers thinking we won’t notice when you change the amount (canned food and cereal), size (towels and sheets), and quality of their items.  Hanes was a recognized brand that could be relied on for the consistency of their products.  No more.  The fabric and waistband are the same, but the boxer shorts I just ordered are a full inch shorter than the ones I purchased years ago.  I will keep them and my husband wears them without complaining.  But I’m not happy that another brand name product is putting profits over satisfied customers."

They do fit rather well, and one barely ever notices that they're even on, but... honestly, they're really too soft and there's that SECOND problem.Too soft? Yep. They make no attempt whatever to remain in place when you pull up your jeans, so at any given moment one side may be acting like boxers and the other side like jockeys (tighty whiteys), or both sides may be acting like jockeys... and it's a crapshoot (honestly no pun there) whether you're walking around with a thong-inspired wedgie that goes all the way up to your soprano.The OTHER thing. I can't speak for anyone else, but when it's time for me to hit the head, I need to hit it hard and fast. I don't have time for fumbling around, digging and swearing to find a teeny tiny button-up pee portal that (because of the softness or design of the shorts) may actually be far around the side of my hip when I most need it at front center where it's useful. Nearly as often as not, I've given up the search for the dang pee portal (WHO puts a BUTTON in the MIDDLE of that thing???) and yanked up whichever legsleeve happened to be nearest Wedgie Mode at the time in order to save myself a good sock drenching. If I was a reg'lar sit-down sorta' guy, that just wouldn't matter much... but in that case I really wouldn't care if it had a pee portal or not, even if there was a BUTTON in the MIDDLE of it to split the stream.But yeah, walk-around comfort when they're not in Wedgie Mode is really pretty decent.

For size reference all my 2XU compression pants are sized medium and hit right at the ankle. My 2XU in sized medium are very hard to get on but once they are on they are tight everywhere and you can feel the compression. These in the same size medium are way too easy to get on. Flimsy material. These are probably about at least 3 inches too long and also too lose. Especially from the knee down and at the ankle. Its like I'm wearing some worn out stretched out socks.

Edu P.,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 6, 2022",Expensive! (Go down one size for compression),"I’m not sure why these are so expensive. The quality is ok, nothing special. I’d be ok with that if the length wasn’t so short. I’m barely 6ft and these rise up to look like 3/4 length. I believe there is an option for a talk size. If I decide to purchase them again (for less), a longer pair might work.Update:I’ve been working out in these and really like the quality of the material. I was initially a bit concerned with how thin they appeared to be. In my opinion, this actually helps to both allow better breathability and they are very lightweight. The biggest gripe I have is in the sizing. I am 6ft 200 lbs and have fairly long, athletic legs but the large (my normal size) does not provide any actual compression. I bought another couple pairs and went down to a medium long to both cover the length of my legs and provide more compression. This seems to have resolved my issue when working out.

Tried two pair to be sure the first one was not a “one off” and had the same result on pair two.  I selected these because the name Fruit of the Loom has always meant quality to me.

MrBob,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 28, 2018",NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM FRUIT OF THE LOOM,"I seldom right bad reviews but because I’m so disappointed in this purchase I had no choice. I’ve been wearing crew socks since my early teens probably longer. Now I’m pushing seventy which means a heck of a lot of socks. Being house bound and stuck in a power wheelchair I seldom wear shoes. The foot rest on my chair is deliberately made rough to prevent my feet to fall off. This of course destroys the socks and when my toes started sticking out I knew it was time to replace them. I find it easier to toss every pair of the old socks and replace them with new ones. Because of the being house bound Amazon is my shopping mall. Everything I need to purchase is researched on the web and then price checked here at Amazon. Usually but not always Amazon has the best prices. This time they did. I have to mention buying socks here at Amazon is mind boggling. The selection is so large and just about if not all the manufacturers are present. I purchased these socks mainly because the price was good, the quantity and the brand name. I mean where can you go bad with Fruit of the Loom. So the socks arrived and right from the moment I picked up the package I knew something wasn’t right. The socks were well represented by the photo and I’ve worn these or similar brands so I knew what they should looked like but there was just something about them. As I said I just toss the old ones and replace them with the new ones. I had already tossed a few and the six remaining pair were placed on the dresser ready for a trip to the dumpster when I realized what was wrong. The new socks, all ten pair, weighed a heck of a lot lighter than the worn out six pair. Now I understand just about everything made these days has been cut back in materials and the quality isn’t the same but WOW! The difference between the new pair and the old was very disturbing. Oh well there’s nothing you can do. At least they looked alike. While comparing the two it became more evident in the differences. The bottom portion of the socks are padded but the new ones couldn’t match the old ones for the thickness. Remember I’m comparing socks I’ve worn for years against brand new ones. I’m assuming that Fruit of the Loom either has cut corners too much or they must have different quality socks sold on Amazon. Oh I’ll wear them but I won’t be a happy camper while doing so. I might be dwelling too much on the old days when you got what you paid for."
Shannon Yun,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 10, 2022",Just Ok,"These are perfectly ok socks. There’s not a defining heel in them so it feels a little awkward putting them on at first, kind of like a tube with a closed end.They don’t feel as if they’ll last more than one season but we’ll see. The good thing is my teens didn’t care for them, so I won’t have the socks disappearing from my sock drawer during the school week. I will use them, but will definitely go for a higher quality next time."
Ryan O'CONNOR,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 29, 2022",Not as advertised,These socks are advertised as cushioned but they are paper thin at best.

While the listing is for *12* pairs of socks, I only received a package of *10*, which is clearly outlined in the attached photos.

There is no ""wrong quantity"" option in the complaints area in the customer service dashboard, which is very annoying! Getting stuck with a 20% price increase due to someone else's error is just obnoxious! Luckily these are not a luxury item, but a low-cost everyday commodity.

The 2 orders I have received clearly state that the socks are only 75% cotton, 23%polyester, and 1% lycra. I prefer and shop exclusively for 100% cotton clothing. I personally find these socks comfortable enough and affordable so I will keep them.

The ones I received only have the extra fabric covering the toe. No wonder they were so much cheaper than the ones I got from Target. At least they don’t cost much, but I suspect they will wear out 3 times faster, starting with the heel. They are not 100% cotton, they are Lycra and cotton."

He works in industrial construction so from his work boots to the amount of walking/climbing etc. they’ve definitely been tested to the limit. I won’t purchase these for him again as they’ve been the fastest socks he’s ever had to wear out. Highly recommend the same style in Puma socks because the quality of those is exceptional!

Imagine my surprise when I discovered that they were tube socks!!!  Yes, the toe is reinforced, but not the heel, which is where I tend to wear out my socks first.  Because I had already washed them, I didn't try to return them.  They are long, come all the way up to my knees, but stay up well.  It is September, so I can't comment on warmth in cold weather, but my feet haven't been too hot on warm days either.  Very displeased with this purchase.Update:  even though these are tube socks, there is a right way to wear them.  If put on incorrectly, the stitching lays under the toes, chafing the foot.

Amazon Customer,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 3, 2022",NOT Fruit of the Loom,"For the Black size 6.5-12. NOT Fruit of the Loom, just a generic unbranded sockThat's the factually important thing.They're visually quite similar, and may even be factory seconds,  but they completely lack any FOTL branding (should be on the arbitrary 'bottom' of the toe seeing as these are tube socks)What they are:What they are is 59% polyester black over-the-calf tube socks, of a *factory seconds* quality. Other than the lack of branding,  and the significantly higher polyester content, and being a thinner material,  they are visually indistinguishable from the last black FOTL tube socks I purchased, pre-pandemic. The official site shows the same fiber content as this listing, so I believe that's just an acknowledgement that the official product has, also,  gone downhillSo, I'm reviewing these as just cheap, black,  OTC tube socks.  They reach the bottom of my knee  (women's 8.5/ men's 7). They stay up fine on my very thin calves, and have enough stretch to accommodate thicker calves without being binding.  They're reasonably warm.There's a 2"" difference in length in the first pair I pulled out of the bag. I'm only 5'7"", so it's not enough of a length issue to keep the shorter sock from being a true OTC, but it might be an issue for a taller personOverall:The product is 4.5/5 stars for value. The quality could be better,  but I ordered cheap black tube socks and got cheap black tube socks. They're not blatantly garbage.  They're warm, they go up to my knees... I'm ok with the minor issues, given the reasonable price of a difficult to find productThe seller is 0/5 stars for selling unbranded,  factory seconds quality socks as genuine FOTL.  Shame."
Shawn Wheeler,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 19, 2022",Best deal for the price if you're looking for just cotton socks here.,"Best bang for your buck if you're looking for plain ole white socks that are predominantly cotton that won't make your feet smell like death & rotten a$$.Though Amazon could do a better job at offering a wider variety of brands that aren't a complete rip off or filled with synthetic worthless materials for those of us looking for cotton plain white socks - this particular product is good enough for the price range. As usual the delivery speed & service was incredibly fast and unrivaled by even the most Patriotic operated/owned & gallantly bold Overstock dot com company that I will still always be a true respecting fan of. So, good work yet again Amazon & your incredible staff team. Whom I certainly hope that your employee/staff are being taken great care of with both compensation/pay and their well earned respect from both Corporate and their department managers. Cuz these workers you have are clearly going above and beyond and deserve only the best treatment & respect."
Andrew D. Lossing,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 9, 2022",Very Decent,"I was in the market for a new larger pack of black socks, which is where I point myself for all-purpose wear. I've been happy with Fruit of the Loom products before, they are always a good value for the quality. These are generally right in line with that experience. They are fairly thick for cotton socks, with a welcome bit of padding, but still light. The rib/cuff is just a tad looser than I would like, but avoids being constrictive. The sock mostly stays in place, I will have to see whether that lasts over time. Generally a good buy."
Nevin Tulloch,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 26, 2022",Hope you like knee highs,It may have been my mistake for not reading clearly enough but I was surprised when the socks arrived and I noticed they’re long enough to pull up to your knee. I don’t mind the length since I work outside so I’m the winter it’s nice to have alittle extra warmth. Pretty comfy for the price and haven’t had a pair get a hole yet so that’s a bonus.
Lee,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 30, 2022",Durable...... maybe????,"Been wearing these for about 2 weeks.  The fabric is starting to show some clumping (small little fuzz balls).  Usually that means they won't last too long.  On the plus side, they fit well and I like the feel."
Patricia Hetland,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 15, 2022",Pretty great for the price!,"They weren't as thick or cushioned as expected, but overall they were a great buy for the price. I bought these for my husband for work socks, he works in a factory and gets oil and grease all over his legs which causes him to get horrible rashes. He usually buys calf length socks so he was initially thinking he'd hate these, but he loves that they stay up all day AND his legs are clearing up since these go all the way to the knee."

Also i ride a motorcycle as my primary vehicle and i live in South San Francisco where if we're lucky we get 3days of summer in September otherwise its cold (yes, even with global warming) so a good sock is important. With the 3days of summer gone i bought 36 pairs if socks and threw away and/or burnt my old socks. All 36 pair were Fruit of the Loom, but different types. They are all perfect fitting, warm and comfy...But The ones that actually say Fruit of the Loom on the foot, and although ive never done it, im almost positive this is what walking on fluffy warm clouds is like. They are perfect fitting...comfy ALL DAY and i stand at work ALL DAY...and get this, as i put them in the washer for the first time, i thought well good by ""NEW"" socks...they came out if the dryer EVEN MORE COMFORTABLE, ya, Im serious, man. Im sure someone must have gotten fired at the factory.

These just slide right on and up and don't feel tight, and stay up. They do feel a bit thinner than others (but still perfectly fine) so we'll see how they wear over time.

Ruy2378,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 11, 2021",Back seams across butt can cause sitting bone pain,"I do heavy weight training, and so my thighs and glutes are well developed as I don't skip leg day.  I chose the the 2XL size as it was to fit more comfortably on my significantly larger hips due to squats and deadlifts, as my actual waist size is 35"".  The boxers were comfortable at first for the first 7-9 months I wore them, but as I started gaining more muscle mass the back seams that runs across the ischial tuberosity (medical term for the bony part of the butt that one sits on) started to create ""sitting bone pain"".Although it appears that the back seams are supposed to help eliminate the discomfort of the traditional center seam, the 2 back seams create a whole new problem as they create a hard surface for your body weight to rest on, in which the top half of the body solely rests on the ischial tubersoities.This ""sitting bone pain"" had occurred for about 2 months (about 8 months after purchasing them) when I initially thought I was sitting on the couches and chairs incorrectly for a prolonged time.  It was especially noticeable with hard surfaces (i.e. benches or wooden chairs) and leaned on one side, until eventually the sitting pain even emerged when I sat on cushioned seats.  The glute muscles would feel strangely numb after sitting more than 2 hours (i.e. desk work), and the full pain would appear the day after which I could barely walk at times.  It was so bizarre that I had to constantly self-monitor my sitting position wearing these boxers.I realized after these 2 months that these Hanes boxers solely created that pain, when I purchased and wore other boxers and underwear to compare them to.  This particular boxers design clearly didn't seem to acknowledge the customers various sitting positions and surfaces that a person would have.I would steer clear of these boxers, especially if you have larger posterior, because of the likelihood of experiencing sitting bone pain.  ...I can't believe it took me 2 months to figure it out that the boxers caused it, but then again, who would have thought that boxers would be the source of the pain?These boxers need to be redesigned promptly!"
E. Dyrda,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022",Not even close to what I expected...and not in a good way.,"I thought that I was re-ordering a pack of the same boxers I got a year or so ago. I just ordered a slightly smaller size. What I got was the same brand but something that felt like plastic bags. Terrible quality. The boxers I got last time were soft...thin, but soft. These things really felt like plastic bags. Plus, the tags are printed onto the fabric. Not that I care about that but to me it points to a much cheaper quality product.It should be this hard to buy decent boxers.Beware."
Ben Swoyer,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 21, 2022",Not nearly as nice as they used to be...,"My Husband always wore Hanes boxers. He was due to replace the old ones so I ordered a twelve pack on here. The quality has gone downhill. They are nowhere near as nice or soft as they once were. When I got them out to wash them, I noticed he only got eleven in his pack instead of twelve. I went back to my order details just to make sure that I truly did order a twelve pack. There was random little strings throughout the pack. One of the boxers didn't even have the leg sewn up. This order was just an absolute mess! You pay extra to make sure you buy a good brand and they send you garbage. Once upon a time Hanes was one of the best and now I'm not so sure of that."
David in NH,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022","Terrible fit, Uncomfortable. Threw them away","I am somewhat athletic and these boxers had no room in the butt.

It shipped as a cotton/polyester blend from Vietnam.The material is incredibly thin, almost like gauze. I can easily see through it. It's worse than what they use to make very cheap bedsheets. The only reason I didn't return it was at that the Black Friday price, I can get a little usage from them."
RJM,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 31, 2022",Simply Uncomfortable,I bought these because I wanted a lighter weight boxer and thought these would be perfect. Especially since I’ve owned Hanes products and have always been happy neither them.Unfortunately that was not the case with these. The first day I wore them I noticed they were riding up my leg.  I’d pull them down and I couldn’t go 8 feet before they started riding up my leg again. I’ve never been unhappy with with been  unhappy with a Hanes product until now.Sadly I am now stuck with them since I am no longer able to return them.

MariEli,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 9, 2022",Quality has dramatically declined,"I used to buy these for my husband because the quality of the fabric was much better (hence the “premium” label), however this last purchase was such a disappointment. Upon opening the package I noticed the colors were very similar to their “regular” boxers. Got one out and sure enough the fabric material was thin and not soft as our previous purchases. This is the last time we buy these. On the hunt for better quality ones. It such a shame because these fit great, the softness helped my husband avoid chafing during the hot California summers, but it’s no longer the case with thinner low quality fabric."

It's very uncomfortable and irritating. I like my boxers to feel like they aren't there. These are intrusive and weird on the hind end and I even bought a size larger than what I normally wear. I sleep in them now only and would never wear them during the day. Bending over Pulls and tugs from back to front. Odd design.

I love the old Hanes boxers I have that don't have these seams and are also mediums but these just don't work for me.  The lack of a button in the front is also strange and I feel exposed.  I feel weird about returning underwear so I just took the $20 loss."
George Aramoonie,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 6, 2022",Not as comfortable as the older style,"I've been wearing these for years, and the older style before these. These are bulkier than the older ones and therefore not as comfortable under your trousers. The fly is not where you expect it to be. It always seems to be higher and to the right and makes you hunt around for it. Since the older style is no longer available, these are the best I know of for the price, quality and comfort. The last time I bought them, they were in a 3 pack at Family Dollar. Now it's a 2 pack and cost more than Amazon's price. I'm happy."

Bob Puglisi,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 25, 2022","Tiny Size, Thin Fabric","I weigh 160 lbs, and am a fairly slim male. When I'm in the company of other males, I feel like I'm definitely below average in size. But for some reason I have to buy a ""Large"" size tee shirt to make them feel fit and comfortable. However, I don't consider myself ""Large"" by any means.So I bought a six pack of these Hanes tee shirts, getting the ""Large"" size. Put them through the laundry once, and tried them on and they fit like a glove: tight around the neck, tight around the chest and shoulders, etc. I want a tee shirt that will feel comfortable, which means that it hangs loose and free. But I can't wear these things, and decided to donate them to my 12 year old nephew, and they'll probably fit him perfectly.The sizing chart for these tee shirts recommends to buy a ""Large"" size if your chest is 42-44. I measured my chest size before I bought these and it is 39.Am I supposed to buy ""Extra Large""???? Come on manufacturers, be realistic in your sizing. I know a lot of this stuff is made in Asia where people are a little smaller, but there's no reason not to translate correct sizing to foreign manufacturers.I am really pissed off at this purchase, am angry at the Hanes brand, and I won't go through the aggravation of returning them. I also need to mention that the these tee shirts are very flimsy (you can see right through the fabric), and would probably have lasted about 6 months before falling apart.Sorry for the rant, but wanted to give notice to others who buy these cheap tee shirts to buy them a good two sizes larger than you think you need."

O. M.,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 2, 2022",Poor Quality,Very poor quality. Started developing holes in material within a couple of wears. Every shirt in the package fell apart.
jbuskohl,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 15, 2022",Terrible build quality,"The first thing I noticed after pulling these out of their first run through the wash was the HUGE amount of fabric left on the wrong side of the seam in the pocket on the shirt. This is very noticeable because it wraps around some sort of stiffer fabric to keep the top of the pocket from wrinkling, and that fabric is WHITE and shows up very well against the darker shirts. I've already ruined one of the shirts by trying to cut off some of this excess fabric and cutting through the front of the pocket in the process.The shirts are also quite scratchy, which is somewhat facepalm-inducing when you read the tag and see that they're branded Hanes ComfortSoft."
Shannon,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 18, 2022",Another sad milestone in the decline of affordable t-shirts.,"These shirts are poor quality.  The fabric is thin and ‘gappy’, presumably because the material has been stretched out as far as possible before cutting.  This guarantees that the shirts will shrink considerably after washing, and this is particularly bad considering that they are already on the extremely small side as far as sizing goes.The packaging, of course, sells every defect as a feature.  Stretched out fabric? Extra- breathable!!  Extreme shrinkage?  We’re eco-friendly and want you to only wash in cold.I should have sent the shirts back without opening, but I took a gamble and opened the pack anyway.  First off, I wear an XL- so I ordered 2XL as a precaution.  Imagine my disappointment when the shirts appear to be bordering on a LARGE in size, fresh out of the package.  The length is ridiculously short.  I currently have these in the wash (on COLD), but I expect that these are going to look like baby tees.I suppose that I should have sorted the reviews by ‘new’ instead of going by the overall reviews.  Honestly, when a product undergoes this much of a change in style and quality/quantity of materials. I feel like they should be listed as a mew product with new reviews attached. Hanes is not the only brand that seems to have plunged in quality and are relying on past glories to sell their newer (vastly inferior) products.  I’ve seen the same with Fruit of the Loom and others as well."
Steven Brown,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 9, 2022",Shrink like crazy,I tried one on before washing in cold water and drying on low heat.  It fit.  Now the arms are tight and the length isn't even close to long enough.  What a waste of money.  I will have to find someone who wears a 1x and give them to them.

AJ,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 14, 2022",So-so overall,The stitching of the seams in the underarms is slightly questionable (i've had to resew 2 of the 6 shirts in that area in less than 2 months). Air drying is advised against on this because the ones I air dried on the line shrank down about a size and had the underarm seam issues. I don't recommend buying these if you are a bigger dude because of the shrinking issue.

Taylor,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 4, 2022",Counterfeit??,"I bought 2 packs of mediums, they fit just like a feller would expect, how ever when I got the packs I noticed the the easy open flaps were non existent and the pouches had been melted closed (no big deal) the tape they used to keep the shirts rolled left ALL of the adhesive on the shirts, it took a tooth brush, spray and wash, and 2 cycles in the washer to get it off (seems, not right) then nearly every shirt needed the excess strings cut off (to be expected these days) and then I noticed one shirt sure shrank a lot in the washer…. So I checked the tags of all the shirts 2 shirts that came in 1 of the packs were smalls. So if you want poorly packaged, poorly taped, incorrectly sized shirts… these are the shirts for you. All in all. The shirts that are the correct size are perfect."
TX5150,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 12, 2022",Account for shrinkage,I can wear most t-shirts in the 3XL size even after washing. These t-shirts were slightly big out of the package so I thought they would be fine after washing. After the first wash in cold water and dried at the lowest possible temperature they were too small to wear comfortably. They shrunk considerably more than I expected. A waste of time and money for me.
Denise Miller,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2022",Very thin/almost see through,When you hold it up you can see right through the shirt. Which in my opinion means not durable at all
cavemanjohnnie,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 25, 2022",Cheap quality and shady workmanship,"I purchased these in mid-September of 2022, after 2nd washing and went to put one on, I noticed a tiny shiny clear-looking piece of tape on the back shoulder area of the blue shirt. I had a hard time getting it off and it seemed to be heat set. I finally got most of it off and saw there was a small hole (about the size of a BB). I suspect that whoever inspects these shirts in one of the off-shore factories that sell to Amazon decided to just pinch the material closed and put this tape-like material over the hole. It wasn't visible until it was washed a few times. Not saying that Amazon is at fault just be extremely careful and inspect very thoroughly when buying clothing from Amazon."

B,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 26, 2022",Tape Residue Pain In The Butt To Remove,"They use tape to secure the shirts. Unfortunately this leaves residue on every single shirt. It doesn’t come out after a wash cycle. And if you dried it without realizing, it’s now super obvious with lint stuck to it and even harder to remove now. So then you’re left attempting to get it off with alcohol or what have you and potentially ruining your “new” shirts."

Brooke,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 19, 2022","Good quality, soft, and fit well","My husband uses these as undershirt/ work shirts. They are comfortable and soft but if you like a tidy tight collar they start off a little bit big and tend to stretch out a little after 10 or so uses and wash cycles. Also, the sleeves are a little shorter then some of most of his other shirts but it is still a comfortable length. Other than that highly recommend them for quality of shirt."
Stars and Bars,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 3, 2022",More thinner than expected.,"I work outside and needed some t-shirt for normal work days.  I ordered the six pack with pockets but when they arrived they were much more thin than expected. Also, both my gray shirts seemed to have more material in the sleeve of the shirts.  A lot of material under the arm pit area. and hung down well below normal.  However the rest of the shirts were fine.-There is nothing wrong with the shirts if you are working outside or doing yard work but the shirt seemed to be more of an undershirt that a shirt to wear as an about-town shirt.-Another situation I had was placing them in dryer.  I washed three of the shirts with the normal laundry but because of the thin material they dried very fast.  By the time the end of the drying cycle was over the shirts were wrinkled, one very bad.  So I will not be placing them in dryer again.The shirts were everything stated but these are not the shirts I was expecting.  But I do have shirts to work in yard with or in case I need an undershirt.  Just too thin for a 59 year old man."

I've been throwing this hoodie on after getting out of the pool or for patio drinks and it's great!The Armourfleece hoodie isn't too thick and I haven't overheated in it. The looser fit just means added comfort in my opinion. I also love the ""scuba neck"" which adds some extra material around the neck to lock in heat.One thing to note is that the hoodie does wrinkle.

andrew,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 19, 2022",Good 5 years ago (from El Salvador).  Suck now (from Honduras).,"AWFUL SLIDE IN QUALITY THESE LAST 5 YEARSNO QUALITY ONCE MOVED PRODUCTION TO HONDURAS2017 - Bought 1 Medium, in black.  Fit great so I bought another.  (I'm 5'9"" 155 lbs)- They were properly loose fitting, and the waist fit well (not too tight)- The elastic cuffs at the bottom of each leg were appropriately fitting (snug fit, not too loose)- Pretty good sweatpants!  Wish I had bought 10 of them at the time, as I look back.- Tag said they were made in El Salvador.2019 - Bought another 2 pair, Medium, in black.- I'm still 5'9"" 155lbs, but these 2 pair were MUCH SMALLER overall than what I had bought prior.- They were tight everywhere and not as properly loose fitting as should be.  (cost savings by the manufacturer to use less fabric)- And, compared to what I bought in 2017, the waist was WAY TOO SMALL and the elastic was different and SUPER TIGHT.  I fixed these by using a thread cutter to cut thru most of the waist elastic, so they wouldn't be SO TIGHT that they were cutting me in half.- Also, the ""elastic"" cuffs at the end of each leg did not fit as snugly/properly as prior.  They were somewhat loose around the ankles, and more loose than I wanted.  Not sure if there is actually any elastic there.  Seems like just bunched up fabric, to look like it's elastic?- Tag says made in Honduras.2022 (January)- TOTAL DISASTER.- I bought 2 Mediums, in black, thinking ""How bad can they be"" and ""I'll fix them like I did last time if needed.""- Well, these had EVEN LESS fabric in them than 2019.  They are actually super, super, super tight/snug EVERYWHERE, as opposed to being loose fitting, baggy sweatpants like they used to be.- EXCEPT......EXCEPT.....even though they are too small/tight everywhere.....the Leg Cuffs are SUPER LOOSE and seem like there is NO ELASTIC there anymore?  So they don't fit snugly down at the ankles, allowing cold air to get in easily.- These Mediums were SO SMALL AND TIGHT, I couldn't wear them, and I couldn't fix them like I had done in the past.- These Mediums should have been Smalls, not Mediums.- I donated them to St. Vincent DePaul, rather than deal with the Return.2022 (February)- TOTAL DISASTER CONTINUES- Decided to try the LARGE size, since Fruit of the Loom had RUINED the Medium size with their INCREDIBLE decrease in Quality the last 5 years.- Unfortunately, the LARGE size is also a joke.- At least these fit me at the Waist now, but I had to buy Large versus the Mediums that fit me 5 years ago (and I've been 5'9"" and 155 lbs the whole time.- And the Leg Cuffs, that are supposed to have an elastic and fit snugly at the ankles......what a joke.  The Leg Cuff opening is HUGE as opposed to somewhat Narrow.  And if there is an elastic there, there's no way to tell.  Just seems like bunched up fabric, but forming a Big Hole for the leg opening.  Which of course allows a BUNCH of cold air to sneak up in there.SUMMARYThis company lost control of their quality after moving production from El Salvador to Honduras.It seems they are not EVEN CHECKING their product, for the last few years, or this ridiculous slide in Quality would not continue. (I had to switch from Medium to Large, while my size has not changed.)The contract manufacturer in Honduras has LIKELY been taking Cost out of the product (use less fabric, use crappy elastics or no elastic on leg cuffs, etc.) so they can manufacture it for less cost, while still getting paid the same amount by Fruit of the Loom.- But Fruit of the Loom is SUPPOSED to catch this decline in Quality, and stop it.- But they have not done this.- Fruit of the Loom is ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL on this one.- AVOID"
Andy,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 6, 2022",Like most stuff use to be great,"I use to love these sweat pants. They were warm and comfortable and a large fit just right.

I weigh the same but now the large feels like a xl. They are huge and baggy on me. I wish these company's would just leave stuff the same and quit changing stuff to save a buck.

Slim fit is the least comfortable and worst fashion trend since the 80's dayglow colors.  I am looking for a regular pair of athletic pants.  These ""medium"" slim fit pants fit my 13 year old daughter who normally wears a women's small.If you hate slim fit as much as I do, please help us all out by returning these crappy products and then maybe the sellers will stop carrying them.  My supply of regular fitting pants from 20 years ago is wearing thin, so I need this slim fit junk to end soon.

Sarah,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 20, 2022","Would be great, except....","I had some sweatpants that lasted me for years...maybe even a decade. I think I got them from Costco; not sure. Eventually the back wore out along the seam and I decided to replace them with these pants. And at first I really liked the pants; they were just the right size, nice and soft, they had pockets., everything was good. But then, within a week or two, a small hole formed near the edge of the back seam. That was a bummer, but I figured it was just a bad one and, since the hole wasn't huge, I decided to just live with it. I even bought two more pants from this listing (heather black and grey). Well, in a matter of days the heather gray pair developed two sets of small holes along the back seam, and the grey pair formed a hole in less than 36 hours. Ridiculous. I don't even sit on the part where the hole formed, so it wasn't a friction thing, and the pants are loose on me; they weren't stretched too tight. I have no idea why every single pair formed holes so fast, all in the same general area, but since I don't want to be flashing strangers glimpses of my underwear whenever I leave my apartment, I won't be buying anymore of these. It's a shame, because they really are quite comfy. But I guess you get what you pay for."

After much research, and reading reviews I chose these Fruit of the Loom brand.  I just received a call from him saying they are very poor quality and are not open bottom as described (and ordered). They are extremely narrow at the bottom and it required him to remove his socks to get the pants off.  As someone who struggles with mobility, this was not what he expected or wanted. As is typical he got them yesterday and threw the bag and everything in the garbage.  So now on top of not having a new pair of pants, we wasted money as I can’t get them returned."

twinkleshops,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 17, 2022",Way too small - large fits like a medium in other brands,"Ordered 4 different colors in size large.  All were much smaller than a large should be.  Compared with size medium in a competing brand that were from last year, and these are a little smaller than the medium.  I'm ordering an xl in the hopes it is actually closer to an actual large size this time."
Mr Lee,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 5, 2022",Medium—a bit too big,I am around 5’5 and 120 lbs. I figured since my hoodie size is medium so should my pants. Boy was I wrong. Definitely get a small if you’re around my size. Hope this help someone as unfortunate as it was for me.
Robert A.,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 6, 2022",Useless Pockets,"The pockets are so shallow, coins, keys, and cellphone often slide out when I sit down. What's the point of having pockets if you can't keep stuff in them? Doubtful it would cost the company half a cent more to deepen the pockets to a useful and more reasonable depth. Never had this problem with any other sweatpants company. Live and learn......"
grizz,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 24, 2022",Not the greatest quality,I've only wore these twice and the stitching has started to come apart. I only walk in them so they don't get over worked. These were bought to replace same brand that lasted for years. Quality has certainly dropped.

Other than the new $30 ""runner"" ones, and open cuff vs elastic cuff, how much different could sweatpants be? Well. A lot.  I know summer weight vs winter weight could be one way, but these arent light, breathable and fluffy, they are dense, thin, and just not as soft as previous FOTL incarnations.  They get the job done tho, you're not pantless.  So what else could one say.... (*click HERE for the full 206 page review)"
Wayne Tempel,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022",Quality Decline,"Just like the majority of clothing manufacturers, the quality of the clothing has declined!

jalywol18,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 20, 2022",They've made them smaller this year.,"I have been buying these in a men's medium for about 10 years.  I still fit perfectly into all of my prior pairs of mediums, and I have been the same weight for years.  This year, I ordered two new pairs of men's mediums; one was clearly a small and mis-sized, but the second was just smaller all around.  I ordered a third pair in Large, and it fit just like my older pairs of men's mediums.  (The large ones used to be cut so big they would swim on me...not anymore).So, my advice is, if you are used to having these fit in a Medium, you may want to buy a Large instead this year, as they have really changed their cut."
cwc,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 15, 2022",changed from before,I like the open leg style jogger.  These  are much smaller cut everywhere. Almost to short in the stride.  At least 3 inches narrower on the bottom. And 2inches shorter. Waistband is not as  comfortable. I will keep because they fit but not as comfortable. Sweatpants are supposed to be all about comfort so won't be buying anymore. The joggers that fit me better is Fruit of Loom sofspun . They are on amazon also.

Well, it came a day early and that was great, and the size was OK. But now I know if I want a little more room ORDER LARGE!!! Anyway, these sweatpants are great. A little thinner (in material) than I expected, hence my headline. I do lounge around in them and even sleep in them and I am very happy. I have a 38 waist, so I guess that's a large. Now I know. If a need another pair, I will get the large. I am happy and these are just fine. RECOMMENDED!Rich"
Isabella Salvucci,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",I really wanted to like these,"Okay.  So remember how back in the day, we could go to a walmart or a kmart and pick up some inexpensive, thick, nice, reliable sweats? Usually fruit of the loom or hanes? That's what I thought I was getting when I ordered these.  I was wrong.They are soft, but on the thinner side.  The waist band isn't elastic, you have to utilize the white tie that I think looks ugly.  I also had an issue with the ""sinched"" ankles, they were very loose and were not as advertised.If you're like me and were looking for a nice thick pair of sweatpants, then I'd check somewhere else and skip these."
Andrew H.,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022",Legs are on the skinny side so the knee fabric gets stretched out,"These are a good product at a good price. The fabric weight is comfortable and not too thin or bulky. The feel of the fabric is very nice.  The waist & length fit is excellent. I have an average body build at 6'1"" and find the legs too skinny. They just taper too much and drag on my calves and the knee area has already started stretching out so when standing straight the knee area is bulgy and saggy. Too bad really b/c other wise the fit is one of the best I've found. I bought the open bottom. I wear it around the house, do light yard work, exercising."
Annalisa Kercher,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022",Small but Soft,"I ordered a 2XL for the sweatpants that are usually baggy for me from other brands (like Walmarts sweatpants, campus bookstore sweatpants, etc) but these were tight in the legs from thigh to calf. The waist band was totally fine though. I guess fruit of the loom is just tryna tell me to lose some weight. Color came as shown. Kinda gives off a justin beiber kinda vibe. Also, I’ve washed them three times and they’re still nice and soft on the inside. Keeps me warm and feeling fuzzy."
Love to read,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 29, 2022",A bargain!,"I'm a large woman, and have had difficulty finding plain sweat pants that fit and are practical.  I bought two pairs of sweat pants for women and had to return them for a design flaw (Somebody put cheap scratchy metal zippers on the pocket openings.)So I bought these.  Three pair.  For less than the cost of one pair of women's sweats.  Women get ripped off in clothing.Very happy.  Four stars, only because the fabric lining the pockets is a plain fabric, not as durable as the pants."

Amazon Customer,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",Not as good quality as before,It seems like Fruit of the Looms quality gets lower with every passing year..The fabric is ok but the workmanship is even worse than the same product I bought last year..The sewing is poor quality..Hoping they will make it through the winter without coming apart completely..May try another brand next year but have bought FOLoom for years and back then you couldnt beat them for the price..It's sad to see a good brand go downhill..
Gab,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 13, 2022",Bigger is better,If you’re going for something comfortable definitely size up as it will shrink a little bit in the wash. Especially if you want a baggier feel to them.  I got a small and it fits me snuggly after the wash.

Stew Kaplan,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 13, 2022",Great Quality Sweats at a Fantastic Price,"Buying these sweats for under $10 I worried they might be a little on the shoddy side. They're excellent! Great quality - after a number of washings no pilling, shrinkage or general falling apart - and perfect mid-weight thickness. Nice deep pockets: my phone doesn't fall out when I work out.I usually buy large (I'm 5' 8"" 160 lbs. with a 33-34"" waist) but Amazon recommended Medium, so I gave it a try. Especially since I saw some comments that said they ran *very* long. Waist-wise they fit perfectly, which was great since they don't have what I consider a ""real"" drawstring: it's a loop end rather than 2 separate ends you can tie together. Lengthwise I felt they were just a touch short, but maybe I was used to the larges being just a touch long ;-)Exceptional value for the money."
Amazon Customer,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 30, 2022",Getting a few more,"I discovered sweatpants for the first time after living in the US for 20 years, and i'm never going back. Very comfortable to wear, and keeps warm reasonably well (in my house that I set at 65 degrees in winter, because i dont love burning money).I'm a short man (only 5'-5""), with a 34"" waist, so I was worried it might be too long at first. It kind still is a bit long, but the elastic bottom holds the bottom of the pant at my ankles perfectly, so i never had a problem of walking with sweatpants wrapping my foot. Really glad of my purchase.Try it, and send it back to Amazon at no cost if it doesnt fit. If it works for you, it's life changing :)"
Charles Suval,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2022",Fantastic fit and perfect for all day wear,"I needed something to wear that I could use during errands on weekends and to wear on those ""active"" work days where its too cold for shorts but a lot of movement needed.  Enter these fleece sweatpants!  They are bulky but they are warm enough so that I can work inside and out and go back and forth while still feeling comfortable! Excellent price.  The closest until now were some from Walmart.  These manage to stay in place even with a wallet in one pocket and car keys in the other."
Rebecca Treadway,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 5, 2022",Works for this woman,"My only complaint about this item is the fabric - though very soft - it felt a bit thin but it did keep me warm when the temps went down to about 35 degrees. They are men's sweatpants but they fit me just fine, I got them since the same type of pants for women always seem to run too short for me.

Wayfuncarol,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",Comfortable and cozy!,I needed some pants that fit loose for awhile. These were great! They are comfy and cozy.

Wonderful pants!
Dale,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",Much thinner material than the ones I purchased previously,Purchased these for my son.

Working with the warming store was a nightmare. Initial delivery took several weeks. After I made the return they would not issue a credit. Ultimately I had to dispute the charge with my bank. Boo... I have owned and wore several dozen Carhartt garments over the years including several denim shirts, heavy winter coats, 2 full body Arctic suits. And have always been 100% satisfied with unquestionable high quality. And could buy Carhartt garment with confidence just on account of the brand name. After this experience I am not so sure.

Joshua Marshall,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 4, 2021","Great, but wish the quality was on par with other Carhartt products I own.","Breaks my heart to give 3 stars and not 5. It was tough to find a vest of this type that doesn’t bull on neck hairs if you don’t shave everyday, but this one does the trick. Now, for why it’s 3 stars. The Major draw back is the stitching. I’ve worn this maybe for a few months now, generally late at night as an extra layer when walking my dog. With literally NO labor performed wearing the vest, not even snow removal from a car, and stitching throughout has begun to pull. I haven’t washed it yet either, so I’m not really sure what can contribute to this. Sad as otherwise it is a perfect vest, but within a year I’d imagine it’ll be frayed all over, which seems fast for the price."

I got a small coffee stain on it that won't come out, but that seems to be very common with any of the polyester/puffy jackets or vests that I've always had. Seems to be an issue with the nylon shell; doesn't matter what brand, color, or item.  Make certain if you consider yourself a tall person that you order the tall sizes. The first one I ordered what is regular size and it was a little too short, had to return it for a tall and it fits much better. This is a 40 to 60 degree Fahrenheit vest.

But, it isn't what I was expecting it to be. It will be good for spring, summer and early Fall but I was expecting it to be a bit heavier.  It doesn't have the traditional ""heft"" of a Carhartt product. Which is positive and negative. The positive is that even my wife has said ""I really like the cut of that. It's really nice."" Typically anything I buy Carhartt she thinks makes me look like a construction worker. This vest could easily have a Columbia, REI or Patagonia logo on it and nobody would think twice. The negative is that it is light and I question if it will hold up as well as the typical Carhartt products and their heavy, durable weight. Time will tell. But, I really like it anyway."

That jacket is still in great condition, but I wanted another soft shell jacket for work. I decided to purchase this jacket again but Columbia is now making an inferior jacket.The lining is not as thick and the collar which used to be fleece is now just made of the same material as the outer shell of the jacket. But the worst part of the jacket is the zipper. My original one came with YKK zippers which are the best in the industry. You can feel the quality of them. The new version comes with zippers made by Ideal. They're awful. You can immediately tell how bad they are. Read the other reviews on this jacket and save yourself the trouble and buy something from another brand that is still making excellent products."

Izzos,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 25, 2022",Declining Quality and Materials Compared to Previous Jacket,"I purchased a Columbia Ascender Jacket in 2016 and have worn it almost everyday for 6 years. It was finally starting to wear out in one elbow where I rested it on my desk, so I ordered the identical jacket on amazon to replace it. I was very disappointed when my new jacket arrived. Columbia has obviously started cutting corners on these jackets, here are some of my immediate observations compared to my old jacket:- The new Jacket is obviously made using a thinner material, the internal lining is not as thick or soft. This is a big deal as the jacket will not be as durable or warm.- The main zipper teeth are thinner and the zipper tends to get snagged as it zips, compared to the old jacket which had appropriately sized zipper teeth and zipped smoothly from day 1.- The breast pocket is about 1 inch shorter, no longer easily fits my wallet. I can still get my wallet in and out, but it's not like the quick draw it used to be.- The waist cinch is now only on one side, it used to be on both sides for a more even cinch.- The elastic cords on the zippers are a thinner/cheaper material and not as easy to grab.I can tell that the materials used on this jacket are much cheaper and less durable. When this new jacket wears out, I won't be buying another identical replacement, I'll find something else."
Michael P.,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 29, 2021",Decent Quality Knockoff,"I found this jacket is decently made and meets my needs, so I did not return the item. I am, however, fairly certain this is not genuine Columbia. If it is, it would mark a substantial decline in built quality. I have had several Columbia jackets over the years and they are built to last. In fact, I still have a snowboarding jacket bought about 20 years ago that looks well used but is still serviceable without defects. I include some comparison photos between this item and genuine CSC. Most obvious is the zipper. Every other CSC jacket I have ever owned or purchased for family used high quality YKK zippers. This uses ""Ideal."" Tag style is a bit different. I don't know if CSC uses multiple countries to manufacture, but this was made in India while the one I had on hand was made in Indonesia. The tightener is also lower quality, with thinner cords and much thinner plastic parts.Now, on to functioning of this item. As some others have noted, the zipper is not smooth at bend point near the collar. Most likely it is the wrong type of zipper for so much bending. I don't zip all the way up often, so this wasn't a dealbreaker for me. Water proofing works decently well. It has the right amount of warmth to serve as light to mid jacket range, which is what I needed.Overall, I likely would have given this jacket 3-4 stars if it wasn't a counterfeit sold as the real thing. For that reason, I dropped it down another star."
Andy Deveau,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 24, 2021",I wanted to love this jacket!,"I owned an Ascender jacket for many years and used it as a fleece layer for warmth.  And I love the fabric, which is somewhat water repellent unlike fleece.  As far as I could tell, Columbia is the only outdoor company that makes a lightweight jacket out of this material.This purchase was a replacement for the original jacket, which finally just wore out. I wish I could give this a higher rating. I took it on a recent trip to Iceland and used it every single day, since the temp there always hovered around 50 and it was rainy. The darn thing failed me, unfortunately.  This jacket zipper failed me in my hour of need. Unlike my original jacket, which had a beefy zipper with big teeth, this one had really fine teeth. The first time I zipped it up, it separated down at the bottom. Unless I was really careful when putting the zipper together, the separation happened frequently.  Once it separated, I always had a helluva time getting it unzipped again.Unless Columbia corrects the zipper issue, I would not buy this jacket again. Unfortunately I'm now past the return/refund window, so I'm going to pay someone to replace the zipper with a heavy duty one like the original.  :-("
Lamby,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 13, 2022","Nice jacket, TERRIBLE zipper","I purchased this jacket to wear as tight fitting thin base layer to wear under my motorcycle jacket. the material and fit are perfect.

AMZN Ace,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 25, 2019",Vanity Sizing Strikes Again; Zipper Problems,"This is advertised as having a ""Regular Classic/Modern fit."" So I based my size choice on the expectation that a Regular Classic/Modern fit might fall between a Classic fit and a Modern one. I have a normal/athletic build with somewhat short arms. Other than sleeves being too long (a casual-clothing problem I live with), a size Medium that fits between a Classic fit and a Modern fit should have fit me perfectly with a whit of extra room for layering. Except trying this jacket on, the fit is nothing other than a typical Modern fit, with characteristic narrow shoulders and long, narrow arms.Well, I should have read the fine print on the Size Chart, which says to add 2-3 inches to your actual measurements. Ordering this jacket in your correct size results in a Modern fit. Which means this jacket is the same size as a Modern fit shirt in your correct size. Which means this will look fashionable on when you wear it over a shirt--if you can actually get it over a shirt--but forget the idea of layering anything under it.Hey, here's an idea: Why not  make the measurements as listed on the Size Chart be those of the wearer (""Body Size"") rather than the exact dimensions of the jacket (""Garment Size"")? OH I KNOW!!! VANITY SIZING STRIKES AGAIN!!!I can wear this as long as i don't layer anything. But this jacket is so tight on me that I can't move around very well. Thinking i might want to layer something under this, or I might even want to move my arms or body, I was considering exhanging this for a Large or even Extra Large but debated doing so because the sleeves on larger size would be way too long on me. If you're built the way clothing manufacturers seem to think all men are built today--tall and skinny--then this jacket will in fact be right up your alley. The modern fit is a recent fashion trend that may or may not last, but for now it has become the norm in today's modern world.One other thing I noticed is the zipper on this is delicate and does not zip smoothly.  You can get it to zip but sometimes you need to make an effort. Unfortunately cheap zippers seem to be a recent fashion trend too.Between the time I posted this review the other day and the day Amazon posted it, the zipper decided to give up the ghost. As I write this I have returned the jacket for both the sizing issue and the defective zipper. I now understand  how to interpret Columbia clothing size charts (the charts list ""Garment Size"" not ""Body Size"") so I will consider replacing it with the same jacket in a larger size. But I also know the zippers on these things come with possible issues.Other than my personal issues with the modern-era fit and modern-era zipper, I liked the style and feeling of this jacket. It seemed like it would work well as a so-called ""in between"" coat for Fall and Spring when temperatures here in the temperate region are between 40 and 60 F."
Brent M.,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 23, 2022",Huge decrease in quality since 2014,"I first purchased this jacket in 2014 and wore it as my everyday fall/winter/spring outerwear up until last week (2022) when I finally managed to snag and tear it. That original model was perfect, warm but not too heavy and built to last as evidenced by the fact it survived eight years of heavy use.I bought a new one and was dismayed that it weighs about a third less, has a thin fabric liner (the original had felt on the entire inner including the collar) and the zipper is now a tiny-toothed cheapo that is already hitching and I expect will fail after a few years. It's also missing the elastic portion of the sleeve cuff that kept it snug against your wrist without needing to constantly tighten and loosen the velcro band.The jacket is shedding threads at all the seams, time will tell whether they were sewn too close to the edge of the fabric and pull out.Not impressed, once it falls apart I'm going to have to find another brand."

I wear it in the seasons of fall and spring (live in NY). That’s 4 seasons I wore it. Just last week the zipper failed.

The material is extremely resistant to dirt. I was recently working an event where the jacket was under a table on a concrete floor for the entire day.

Jack Ruby Built The Pyramids,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 8, 2022",The length on the Cavier colored pullover is ridiculous,"I'm a 5'8 bigger dude and ordered an XL.  I knew when I held it up it wasn't an accurate sizing as this thing looked 5' long.  Tried it on over my t-shirt and the fit was ok except for the length.  This must be a big & tall XL (tall XL) because the bottom went all the way down to just a 6 inches above the back of my knees.Would be a great nighty pull over for a woman but otherwise this would only properly fit length-wise for someone more in the 6'4"" range."

Anna Talcott,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 29, 2022",Great except for the sizing!,Very warm and soft in the inside but is not true to size. I ordered this for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift but sadly had to return it because it was way to big as a Medium.

If I'm being honest though if you're my size and like a more fitted fit, do an xs. This isn't baggy but definitely relaxed which is what I like.Good quality and material, soft on inside. The collar is not the same material, it's grey colored but that doesn't bother me - seems like it will be warm however it was uncomfortably large. I'm 5'5, 145 pounds. I usually wear a medium in everything. Mediums are a loose, ""relaxed"" fit on me. I was swimming in this when I tried it on. Exchanging for a small - will update when it comes."

Bob P,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 5, 2022",Would be excellent if waistband didn't roll.,"Good product except for one stupid thing.  The waist band material fabric grain direction is wrong, and allows the waist band to roll.

Off-Grid Family,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 25, 2022",Fit is fine but something about how they wear feels off,I have really tried for a couple months to give these a shot and I can't settle on why I really don't like them. The fit is fine on them. They didn't shrink up in the wash. The design visually looks good. The threads are great and don't stick out. But I just don't like wearing them. They feel like somehow they are both my size and completely made for a different shape all at once. I don't mean like a different size I mean like a different species trying to wear underwear. I can't pin down why they feel this way outside of maybe somehow my batch got the pieces sewn together wrong? I don't know how else to describe it other than perhaps they mixed the pieces of a couple different styles together and made them into one.Because it's so particular to myself I'll still give these 3/5 as they are probably great for everyone else. I'm hoping I just got the one super weird set. If it wasn't for this one issue I'd love them.

He says it does not roll down like others. Only reason it's not 5 star is because it's only been a month and there is already a hole under one of the bands.

They are super soft and stretchy but hold their shape and grip my waist and don’t slide around. I also love the look compared to just normal Hanes cotton boxer briefs. The big waist band is a lot more comfortable than the normal average waist band on basic boxer briefs. Overall I would highly recommend them. I’m going to be buying more and switching all my underwear to these.
Tinkerer,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 27, 2022",Super comfortable,Definitely not the typical cotton underwear but they feel soft and amazing.I wore them for a day and to the gym.

J. Martin,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 18, 2022",The zipper doesn't zip up far enough,The whole purpose of these pants is to be able to take them off without taking off your sneakers. The zipper needs to open up another 4-5 inches. Other than that the pants are comfortable and light weight.

UsualFighter,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 18, 2022","Wanted to keep these, listed sizing is inconsistent","I found the sizing can be all over the map, 2x, 3x, 4x, are not universal and as in many of the brands I tried for the waist size they claim they will fit, they just don’t!  Or the waist technically fits but everything else feels cut and sized for smaller sizes that it is not comfortable for daily wear.This is a name brand I bought along with one not as know to hedge my bets, I ended up returning this and keeping the Mocoly brand.Thoughts:-fits poorly for larger sizes listed (scales badly!)-Makes the annoying slip slip nylon rubbing sounds when you walk. (This bothers some people more than others)-They look great in the photos and in theory.The worst thing about these is the SIZING options and that it scales very badly for larger sizes listed comfort and fit size.

I see a number of positive reviews and negative (like mine) noting the same issues.The bad. 1) Fit is strange; XL is a small XL; fit is OK at waist but too short a length for XL, 2) These do not fit well over workout shorts, nor do they easily slip over another fabric if you are slipping them off at the gym, 3) the 6-inch zippers at the leg bottoms need to be twice as long; nice feature, but leg bottoms are small and 6"" zipper  doesn't come close to opening enough to fit over shoes.  4) these pants are fully lined with a loose mesh liner, likely to make them more comfortable against your skin; however, pushing your foot down a leg will catch the mesh at the bottom; you might fall over; you have to sit and unwrap your foot.I did return this product"
Katherine Y,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 15, 2022","Workout pants are comfortable and breathable, but the fabric makes a sound when it rubs together","These tall workout pants fit my 6’ 5” tall husband well, providing just the right length. The 100% polyester pants are lightweight, breathable, and comfortable. The inside lining is mesh which will help in wicking away moisture. A drawstring aids in getting just the right fit at the waist. There is a drawback, though. The fabric rubs together at the thighs, creating a swishing sound. This may not bother many people, but I want to mention it."

Mine is the standard size bigger that all other Carhartt coats seem to be, and is exactly the same as my 14 year old coat that it is replacing. I am 5'11 170 lbs and a large is big enough to wear with a hoody and flannel shirt underneath no problem.Edit: After spending a winter with this coat, it is not nearly warm enough for even a Southern US winter. Anything below 40 degrees and you will need to layer. Several mornings were in the teens here last winter and I needed a thick wool shirt, a hoody, and an insulating base layer underneath this coat just to stay warm. I am actually changing my review from 5 to 2 stars just because of how pathetic this coat performs. That said, it is holding up to all the abuse I've thrown at it, like the old coat it replaced."

I have the older version from many many years ago, and naturally ordered another... and now I am asking myself wtf happened?  It's basically just a canvas shell with a 1/16th of an inch nylon liner... good for a raincoat but that's it.  It's 38 degrees out and I was cold in this jacket!  It's a generous fit, which is good because you will need a hoodie or polartec jacket to be warm in this.  I was so disappointed I had to check and make sure Amazon sent the right coat... in their description, this is rated as in the warmest scale, but tags on the coat rate it as warm only.

There was not a thick insulative layer like we were expecting. Good for chilly mornings or quick trips outside,but not for sustained cold temperatures. I should have known by the price being at least $100 less than my husband's, that it would not be the same. For the price, it was a good value, but was just not as warm as needed."

I've actually tried to loosen the zipper lead with pliers to try to free it up to make it easier to zip.  It's better, but not good.  I'm not sure if it's a design flaw or a process error where it was just stitched to tight.Second, with no zipper, it would be nice if it had a couple of snaps, but it doesn't.

Tall jacket might have been fine, but shorter sleeve May be better for working with power equipment like chainsaw.I was  working outside in temps between 15 and 25F and comfortable with only a medium weight long sleeve base layer with high neck under the jacket. Long gloves fit over the cuffs nicely.  I took away one star because the pockets are too shallow to trust a cell phone not to fall out. The two pockets are made for easy access with gloves, so maybe a third pocket would help. Happy with purchase."

William Felty,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 4, 2022",Great Quality Coat for the Price,Just received my coat today and love it so far. Quality seems excellent for a coat with only a $119.00 price tag. I picked the XL Carhartt brown version and the color is beautiful. As far as weight it feels like a lightweight jacket that is built like a heavy duty winter jacket and seems like it would do just fine in 20-30 degree weather probably not much colder though without layering up. I’ve seen several reviews saying that this jacket runs about a size larger and you should size down and I must say that the reviews are 100% true mine is an XL but fits like a XXL. In my personal opinion the sizing is not necessarily a bad thing because I’m sure Carhartt is assuming you will be using this as an outdoor work jacket and probably taking into account that you will be layering up. All in all you can’t beat the quality and craftsmanship of a Carhartt jacket for $119.00 they truly are in a league of their own and I’m sure I will own this jacket for many years.

EJG,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 27, 2021",Snaps dont function!!!  Exchanged same problem different color,Nice jacket BUT for $80 you would expect snaps to function.  1/2 do and 1/2 dont.  Exchanged item different color and same problem.  Not the only one reporting this problem either.  Better off saving money and looking at CQR Jackets - excellent quality and quality control.
DinoFlint,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 19, 2020",Was great for a few weeks...then lack of quality showed.,"I really liked this jacket (though it is sized one size too big...) Unfortunately, you cannot place your hands in the pocket or else the entire side of the jacket will rip apart. What's really weird about this jacket is that the pockets are about 1-2 inches closer to your back than a normal jacket. I would really like to have one that is ""roadworthy"". I did receive a number of compliments on the style."
Kern,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 11, 2022",Wanted to like this,"Nice style, nice color, nice material,  nice price... BUT weird cut. Through the body it was a slightly loose fit, but the sleeves were huge. I ordered a medium and a large to try. The medium was a decent fit except for the sleeves which gave it a really baggy appearance. I'm not looking for a slim & trim cut, but not looking for baggy either."
Shotglass Shoop,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 29, 2021","Not 100% cotton, if that's important to you.","Size X-large was way too big and billowy, looked like I was swimming around inside it. Returned it and bought a size Large, which was actually a bit too tight. Can't really wear it as a jacket, because it's also too short, looks kinda dopey. As others have mentioned, the snap buttons don't stay together on either size. Finally, although the description says 100% cotton, the tag inside the shirt reads ""Shell 63% cotton 37% polyester/ body lining 100% cotton/ sleeve lining 100% polyester"". The quality seems alright, but this didn't work out for me at all."
jordan,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 7, 2015",Beer gut jacket,"I'm 5'11'' 190 lbs with a large chest and shoulders, athletic body. Size L fits just right in the chest and shoulders, sleeves are the right length, but in the torso it's a complete mess. There's 8-10 inches of excess material, this jacket is made for guys with a beer gut. A little room for layering is expected, but I could add 80 lbs to my midsection or be 9 months pregnant and still have room to spare.Sent the L back in exchange for the M thinking I ordered a size too large like a number of reviews state. Nope, the fabric immediately tore through the armpit, not a well made product for it to tear that easily. Didn't fit in the shoulders/chest, still swimming in the torso.For $70 and all the awesome reviews I was expecting a far better fit. I went with a Columbia shirt jacket/flannel which fits perfect if anyone else reading this is looking for another recommendation."
Darrell D Martin,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 19, 2021",Too Bad...,"Loved wearing this as a light outer...but it ripped horribly on the second wear. No excessive stress was applied to the garment, as I didn't even notice it until I started to adorn it for the third time. Too bad, as I really liked the weight and feel."
Matt G,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 28, 2018",Get a size down or you will be sorry.,"Dont get me wrong, its an ok jacket. But in my opinion, really not worth the 80$ price tag. Also, it runs really large. Order a size down for sure or else youll be swimming in it. I definetley should have ordered the medium, I usually get large but this fits like an XL. I dont know much about whitetail, but really seems like youre paying for a name. Plenty of other, better jackets out there for far less."
HOHFan,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 10, 2018",Looks good but not functional,"Looks good, fits good and pretty roomy, feels pretty warm, but the snaps don’t work very well.  Can’t keep it snapped which really defeats the function of it.  The smallest movement unsnaps the coat.  For as much as this is, the buttons should stay snapped,"
DB51,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 24, 2018",Deceiving,Cheap thin material. A lot of loose stitching for something brand new. Doesn’t seem durable at all. Looks nice but it was made with fashion in mind not actual wear and tear :(
Matthew Klaver,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 16, 2020",Bigger than expected,Jacket was larger and “puffier” than expected. The picture made it look like it was a more fitted cut.
Gavin oneil,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 19, 2019",Size,Well first it did not fit it was sorta baggy for my and I’m a large so that’s what I ordered
Austin,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 7, 2022","Definitely too big for me, and arms to short when I size down.","I'm 6'2"" 180 and the large was way too big on me. I'm a bit in between a medium and large anyway but the arms are way too short on medium jackets for me. It's disappointing as I even liked the shinny material (and it is shinny). This jacket is definitely made for bigger dudes. If you're a bigger guy and you hate that clothes these days are too skinny, this is the jacket for you. If you're not you'll think this is too big and you won't be able to size down because of length. Forget layering, unless you're putting this over a space suit."
Gwynplaine's Dentist,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 20, 2022",Odd outer shell,"Tried a couple of them out. Not sure if it's a treatment or the material itself, but as others have noted, it has an odd sheen to it. Doesn't look waxed; I have some waxed canvas items. Returned so can't speak to durability."
Big Sauce,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 20, 2021",No zipper just buttons,"The jacket fits well, it's that it's it's button up this doesn't keep you warm nor is it a little bit water proof. I guess it a jacket for fashion sake. If you want this jacket for outdoor use dont bother if you are going for a certain look go for it."
Bryant L.,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 22, 2019","Poor quality, buttons fall off, too tight, looks gray online but more green IRL","When reading the product info it says to size down. I typically wear XL but I did what it said and got a LG. I'm about 6' tall, 225lbs,  and 38 waist. It look perfect when I stand up however it feels a little tight on my shoulders. I have a bigger upper body than most I'd say not so much my gut but I have very wide shoulders. Sitting down it feels kind of silly as my shoulders free up but now its tight around the waist. One of the tracks fell off the cuff and luckily I saw it drop on the floor and fixed it or I would have been completely livid. The last thing that I dislike about this is the color. I know everyone's monitors arent the same and whatnot but to me this jacket looks grey. But in real life it's more of a green/gray. I'm not going to return this just for the fact that I dont want to deal with the hassle of doing so. But if I were to buy this again I'd get my regular size and not size down."
John,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 23, 2020",Good Jacket/Weird Pocket Placement,"This jacket is more of a 2.5 Stars jacket, but I rounded up because I do like it despite it's flaws. It fits well and it looks good. There are a few things that bother me about this jacket and some can't be fixed. Firstly when I took it out of the plastic it had an awful smell coming from it. It's difficult to describe what it smelled like exactly, but right away I tossed in the washing machine. Secondly, and honestly most importantly, the pockets on the jacket aren't placed where normal jacket pockets are. They are further back which makes it uncomfortable and awkward to put your hands in your pockets. Thirdly the jacket is made in China.Over all it looks nice and fits well. It would be a 4-5 star jacket if it wasn't for the front pockets."
Brian S Blaine,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 23, 2021",Smells like it was pre-worn then washed,"I like the look, size and feel but  it smells like it was washed in a popular detergent. The kind with the fake fresh smell. Feels pre-worn. Not what I was expecting for the cost."
Kindle Customer,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 22, 2020",Poorly placed pockets,"The opening to the pockets are much further back on the jacket than most, making it awkward to put your hands in them. A hole has already opened by the pocket, most likely from the extra tension from the poor placement.Otherwise decently warm and comfortable. Probably not worth the price."
Christopher Seeman,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 15, 2022",Nice shirt.,Nice shirt really well made and comfortable.
Sanka80,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 19, 2021",Fits Better than expected,I normally wear a Lg. and i ordered a lg thinking it would be a snug fit.It turned out to be a little bit bigger which means you can Under layer it...Highly Recommed.ps.have had this Jacket on my saved for later list for a cpl yrs now.
camp,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 7, 2022",Size down,"I bought this for my husband and having never purchased this brand, I ordered his usual size. It is at least one size too big, I would recommend sizing down. Very good quality though!"
Nate,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 16, 2017",love LW! just not this one...,"peeves:1. lower pockets are weirdly set back too far, they are almost back by your hip bone. if you have the shirt open you feel like you can't even comfortably put your hands in your pockets.2. One of the other reviewers are right, the velcro on the inside breast pocket is way too strong and you feel like it's going to rip the liner when you use it, maybe it will loosen up over time3. I personally don't like that it almost has tails. For a shirt that is not meant to be tucked in, it should be more flat on the bottom. The pictures on Amazon don't really fully describe the bottom border of the shirt, it almost looks silly in my opinion but maybe that's a style thing I don't knowAside from these things, the shirt is beautiful. I plan on wearing it with a plain grey Hanes t-shirt and I have no doubt it will keep me sufficiently warm. It feels like it has a lot of quality in it as well, it feels heavy and solid and I don't mind spending a couple extra dollars for something like this. I have bought a number of their shirts, I like this one, I won't return it, but I prefer the flat bottom flannels with the hood or the plain lined flannel shirts better"
billneistat,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 10, 2022",Great jacket,Cool jacket the pocket lining is poor quality but all in all pretty warm and looks cool
S. Mangan,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 30, 2018","Pairs Well With A Beard, or Beer","An excellent and recommended shirt jacket.  I'm about 215 lbs and 5' 11"", a size large is fits very well, particularly with a flannel or long sleeved shirt underneath.  I find myself warmer than most and this jacket is an ideal thickness for me, not too warm, not too thin.  It blocks wind well and seems to be waxed from the factory as it beads water.  Although if you're going to own this jacket, you should be receptive to learning how to wax canvas.There is a Velcro closed inside pocket, two outer hand pockets and two snap closed breast pockets.  Convenient for a cell phone, beard comb, lip balm, etc.  The side hand pockets hold keys without worry of them falling out.The inner arms are indeed nylon, which I prefer as it is easier to put on over a flannel or other long sleeved shirt.I should add, my fiancee asked that I wear this jacket for our fall themed couple's photos."
Mark-Henry,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 12, 2021",Feels like a comfy old jacket right out of the package.,"I like wearing this jacket.  For me it's kind of a tactile thing.  I'm told that it looks good on me, too.I do wish the sleeves were a little shorter. Though."
Joao Bastos,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 4, 2021",Dresses very well.,Very good
Mondo,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 28, 2016",This Jacket is sweeet,"I'll start with I'm 6 ft 190lbs (For similar size matching)  I live in Arizona so I won't need it on a daily but bought it for a camping trip up north when it gets colder.It fit somewhat bigger than I like my jackets but I hope putting it through a wash/dry cycle will help that. The arm holes were bigger than I expected too. I thought I had above average arm size but when I put the jacket on my arms seemed below average lol  The flannel is a nice touch and love all the pockets inside and out. (""You can hide your weed in there"" lol kidding)The jacket shell I thought would of been a little more ""rougher"" I should say. It seemed softer than I expected when I unwrapped it.Overall if you usually wear a large jacket and you're more on the fitter side. I suggest a Medium but if you're Mr. beer belly or not as fit stay with the large. Enjoy!"

John J. Gilluly,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 5, 2022",Great Shirt/Jacket,"I recently purchased this Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket and would agree with other reviewers -- it is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. Looks great, a rugged style and very comfortable. Perfect for wear on the ranch. Being more of a jacket (it is flannel lined), it wears well over a shirt or a long-sleeve tee. As to sizing, I would say that it runs about a half size larger, which is preferable if you plan to layer, i.e., wear it over something. In fact, I question if it would really wear well as just a shirt. All said, a good looking shirt jacket and a great value. Highly recommend it."
nathaniel t.,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 6, 2022",Amazing,"Love the jacket, I’m a welder, and surprisingly the jacket has no holes from the splatter. It’s very comfortable, use it everyday, 24/7. Probably the best jacket I’ve had in a min. Most likely gonna order 2 or 3 more."

I am purchasing more for Christmas gifts.

Conner Lam,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 13, 2022",A bargain for T’s with a pocket,"These shirts are a real bargain, considering they have pockets, which are hard to come by in T’s.  They do shrink a little when washed, so allow for that in sizing, but overall they are very comfortable for casual wear purposes.  I have no complaints.  Hanes makes quality products and these shirts are no exception.  For the money you can’t go wrong."
