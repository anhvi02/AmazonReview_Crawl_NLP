1,Marilyn,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 11, 2022",Ruined,Super disappointed bought these for my best friends baby shower and they came scuffed up on the toes and the logo has yellow stuff on them ): I ordered the baby pink. Kinda looks like the might be fake crocs

3,Cleofeisha Brereton,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 26, 2022",Color not material not as dislayed,Color and material not as displayed. Looks different. Was not as expected.
4,APrimecustomer,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 6, 2018",Received used/dirty pair,Received USED shoes. The correct color and size were delivered but they were very clearly used and dirty. We are in need of shoes to fit my daughter immediately so I was able to wash them and deal with it but I will not order again. Did not expect foot grime from another person smeared inside the shoe and unknown substances stuck to the bottom. You can do better.
5,Anna,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 29, 2016",One Star,"One shoe is too small, and other one its normal, and both are size 2/3 ."
6,Madelyn,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 13, 2018",Packaging.,"I bought these as a gift for a friend for her daughter and the box it came in is smashed. Wanted to give her it with this box it came in, because it’s cute but can’t now that’s it’s ruined."

8,Becky G.,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 27, 2021",Color,Just so everyone knows the color in the picture is way different.  They were more a light purple then a pink.  I wanted pink so I sent them back.
9,Kendall Shiffler,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 20, 2018",Too Big,"I purchased these as water shoes for my one year old's splash days at daycare. I had her foot measured at Dillard's and she's between a 2 and 3. These are just too big for her though. it's not as much about length as it is width. They are just wide/clunky.She can wear them, but as a new walker they are just a bit too big for her and they fall off easily.They are super cute though and I look forward to the day when she grows into them!"
10,Summer 10,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 9, 2017",super cute but don't stay on baby feet,"Bought these for my 1 yr old daughter because they are so cute and the slip on shoes (like natives), as well as natives don't come in her size. The reason for 3 stars is the fact that they don't stay on. for shoes this small, it would be nice if there was some sort of extra strap to keep them on."
11,Joyce,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 15, 2016",Runs big,Cute but definitely runs big

13,Missy,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 18, 2022",Very cute,"Very cute for lil ones but the size runs small . Also it’s not super pink or pink per say , it’s kinda purple. I was only disappointed in the color; was excepting ballerina pink but I got lilac .This is the only bad thing .Other than that , crocs are cute."
14,ALec,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 10, 2022",Cute but color isn't accurate,These are so cute and I'm sure my baby will love them but the color isn't accurate. It's more of a lilac pink instead of true pink.
15,Deyanira Scott,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 24, 2022","Ordered infant size 6, receiver toddler size 5","Crocs were the incorrect size . I ordered infant size, size 6 was the only size available but since it said infant I thought it would be okay. I received toddler size 5. So crocs are entirely too big for a baby. Super cute so can use… maybe next year."
16,Breona,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 16, 2021",Don’t know how to feel..,"I usually always order my crocs on amazon & never had to complain but these. The left foot came bigger then the right side like if it was stretched out or used by big foot, mean while the right is perfect also the color,horrible i ordered a light pink almost like a pastel & got these.i love crocs but honestly hate these..

38,Shelby,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 27, 2022",Poor quality control,"I received two ""Slice"" adult socks. Wtf!"
39,CJ P.,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 21, 2021","Totally cute, but HUGE",I wouldn't call the small slice socks baby socks. They're way to big for a baby. They'd be more fitting for a kindergartener.

46,Tyler Mcniel,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 15, 2022",Great for the money,"I’ve been searching for cute ouches for my diaper bag and they are all so expensive. These are priced right, cute and will do the job. Won’t fit a TON in each as they are narrow, but I just want it for pacifiers, small toys, small loose items that could get lost in diaper bag. Good typical canvas quality."
47,Kurt Calhoun,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 24, 2022",Adorable! Perfect size.,"I bought these for my sister to take to the hospital when she has her daughter.

Baby items should be screened especially newborn before items are shipped it's sad that this happens because Amazon is a huge company and could have better quality assurance. If I was giving this as a gift I would be embarrassed that I sent something just someone that smell so bad for their newborn baby fix the problem Amazon and it be nice if I could get an item that doesn't stink stink stink. And I purchased two sets of this item so again a waste of money. Fix the problem!!!
51,Heat Muzik,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 28, 2022",The smell is horrible,"Omg, I opened tge packs of shirts and they smelt like dog poo. I couldn’t believe the smell. I washed the shirts and couldn’t get the stink smell from them. Do not buy these for your baby, you will regret. I am very disappointed with my purchase."
52,Sara Coppersmith,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 9, 2022",Weird smell,I’ve bought these onesies before and they were perfect but this time they had a very weird/horrible smell to them and the color was more of an off white than actual white.
53,Angie Decker,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 20, 2022",Stained on every single one in 3 packs!!,"Been printing on onesies for over 10 years and never seen such a thing. Every single onesie in the (3) packs purchased had stains all throughout them. Unfortunately I used one before reviewing them all so will have to eat that pack, but will be returning the other 2"
54,ReaderJ,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022",Picked and covered in spots,The top onesie was picked over like it had been worn though it had tags still attached so I know it wasn’t. Front and back were covered in tiny little yellow dots. Unacceptable conditionx
55,David,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 5, 2022",SMELLS AWFUL! 💩,I could not give these to anyone they smell absolutely terrible like a child already pooped in them. The smell is so gross. When I open the package it made the entire bedroom smell like crap.
56,Tee ,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 12, 2022",Cheap,Rip right under bottom after one use… just horrible spend the extra two dollars for carters
57,kindle,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 28, 2019",Gerber name but NOT Gerber quality...Disappointed,"I have been buying the Gerber Onseies in 5 pack to embroider. The Gerber trademark, name and quality very evident.I thought I would order the 8 pack to have a greater quantity available. I ordered one pack in 12months and a second in 18 months.  The 5 pack are labeled ""Made in Ethiopia""  and the 8 pack are labeled ""Made in India"". The 8 packs are thinner fabric, dingy-off white and considerably larger when compared to the 5 pack Gerber Onesies. I am not sure that  they will standup to embroidery. I am so very upset that this POOR Quality is being passed off under the Gerber name and that I have basically wasted my money. I am surprised that Amazon allows this."
58,Tetiana Voloshchuk,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 6, 2022","Bad, not original.","Not original item. It’s thinner than original, white color is more yellow, also it smell like a pee. I bought it for my new business and I had such a bad situation because of this bad quality onesies."
59,Char mcdonald,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 19, 2022",Do not buy them. The onesies are NO good,Dirty smelly and the material is not the same as the onesies off the actual gerber site. I wouldn’t want it as a gift. There’s nothing about it that’s good
60,Alexandra,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 2, 2022",Very thin,"I'm not sure if Gerber changed the cotton they used, but the material felt very thin and flimsy. I bought it for layering my son in the cold and I can't imagine they would really help with warmth."
61,Nicole,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 16, 2022",Missing buttons,Nice white onesies but all were missing button only 2 present instead of three.
62,destiny chuks,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 24, 2022",Gerber?,"Not sure if this is counterfeit product or what but, definitely not the Gerber quality I am used to. Came in a clear, unlabeled, plastic bag. Tag says Gerber though. My main issue is that the material is very thin and when your baby wears it stretches out. It also had a funny smell when I opened the package."
63,Druecilla Connors,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 7, 2022",Thought I ordered the ones with long sleeves too,Thought I ordered the ones with 4 long sleeves
64,Niq,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 3, 2022",Idk,"Had a string Weird smell to it, once I washed it with laundry detergent and softener the smell went away."

67,Ricardo A.,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 16, 2022",Baby new clothes with bad smell,"I couldn’t believe it , the clothes are beautiful but when I open the bag this strong smell I don’t know if it was the tint of the graphics but awful strong.I wouldn’t put that on a newborn baby without washing’s before. It’s a shame this was bought as a gift"
68,Jess B.,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 17, 2022",Ehh,"I thought I was getting a great deal on these... jokes on me... they are PAPER thin, see through and seem most likely not washing machine survivable. I will update after washing, but I wouldn't repurchase no matter the price. They were soft though, which is the only reason for 2 stars"
69,Ruth,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 13, 2022",Delivered with a pink hue,When this product was delivered all of the onsies were stained pink.
70,Deana Garcia,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 25, 2022",Shorted a onesie :(,"Supposed to be 8, only received 7. No option to contact seller. No time to return and wait for correct amount to be resent. Product itself is as expected other than not enough items."
71,Lady ,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 6, 2022",Foul order,Item arrived in a clear plastic bag. Upon opening it a foul order similar to athletes foot was present.
72,M F ,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 27, 2022",Does stretch out,I only recommend getting Gerber baby clothes if you plan on using them once or for one baby. They tend to stretch out with use. I would have to rebuy these for another baby or just buy carter onesies.

79,Kyle,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 30, 2022",make sure they aren't mislabeled,"nice onsies for the price.  my problem was that I purchased premie size and the bag was marked as premie, however inside the onesies were 0-3 months, way too large"
80,Lulú ,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 13, 2022",Me gustan,"Me gusta su gruesor, es considerable…transparentan un poco pero a mi parecer he tenidos otros monitos que transparentan demasiado….Así que este cumplió mis expectativas. 🥰Muy básicas para usar y eso es lo lindo. ❤️"
81,Ethan,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 20, 2022","Mostly solid, but not as soft as expected",These are your basic onesies and they are mostly solid - they fit right and can easily be used as underclothes during warm weather. The only downside is that they are not as soft as I expected.
82,Violet,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 17, 2022",Bien de size,"Son muy buenas la verdad, pero transparentan un poco"
83,Terrie Fielder,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 9, 2022",They stain easily,You can’t really use bleach for newborn clothes so just get ready for a one and done wear but I loved them super soft and my son looked so cute in these
84,Beloved,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 10, 2022",They are OK,I have quite a few children and I have never been a fan of these. They are extremely thin and kind of transparent. I got them for under shirts bc they don't have any prints and are so cheap. But now that joy by caters has them for the same price I won't buy these again.If you are purchasing for selling or a gift..don't.

It’s super soft like a baby blanket, and actually stretched more than what I expected it to but works great"
89,E. Ayres,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 5, 2022",They are onesies...,"Just curious what makes these (as labeled) ""boys onesies"""
90,Apes_Vs_Grapes,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 28, 2022",Must have for little ones,These are the gold standard for quality. Our family has gone through lots of white onsies and it's great to have ones you know won't fall apart in the wash or have snaps fall off after a few uses.Stitching is good and sizing is accurate by weight. I advise buying one more pack than you think you'll need.
91,MLR,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 14, 2022",Great for layering,We use these almost every day now that it’s a bit cooler. They are nice and soft and stretchy. We’ve washed them over and over and they have maintained their quality.

94,Jim,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",Cheap enough that you can toss them if there's a blowout when traveling!,Pretty straight forward onesie. Great for newborn's with lots of blowouts and spit up. Fantastic for layering I'm colder weather or keeping babies cool in warmer weather.

100,Darlene,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 11, 2022",VERY VERY SMALL,"My grandson wears a size 5.  However, I purchased a size 6/7, figuring he could grow into them.  We could not get them on him, they were so tight.  I understand being snug as a fire safety, but these were not wearable!!!"
101,Kat,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2022",Unhappy…..,ONE washing & drying & this was our disaster 🥴  Now mom won’t match the rest of the family this year.Pants are just like scrub pants.
102,Robin B.,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 17, 2022",Not Colorfast; Faded in First Wash,"Even purchased on sale, the quality is not worth the price.  In the initial washing — following the care instructions on the label — the black background color faded or rubbed off the pants, apparently where ever they rubbed against another article in the washer or dryer.  Really disappointing."
103,Eduardo Rodriguez,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 8, 2022",Not very comfortable.,They look great but the material is rough and not very comfortable
104,April Lewandowski,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 30, 2022",Cardboard pants,Save yourself the return and just draw some Marvel characters on a piece of cardboard and fashion that into some pants.  You won’t be able to tell the difference in the comfort and you will have saved money and have the pride of making your own lounge pants.  You’re welcome

108,Laura Sanchez,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 16, 2022",the WORST pajamas.,Wow these are the absolute worst pajamas. The logo was sticky and when I tried to open it up it stuck to itself and ripped off. Not only that but the bottoms were weirdly large and scratchy
109,Brigitta Haggins,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 23, 2022",Faded in less than three months,I am saddened by the poor fabric quality of these pajamas. In less than three months the pajamas have faded drastically and are picked up (the little fabric balls that form from shedded material).  The Marvels vinyl logo is peeling off as well. Very poor quality for the price. These were a Christmas gift for my son who loves the Marvel series.
110,Samantha Luna,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 30, 2022",Definitely size up a few sizes,We didn’t have time to exchange or I would have returned. Before being washed my sons underwear already stuck out the top because the waist is too short. After being washed they are ridiculously too short in the waist (the leg length and arm length are fine) and the top is too short so you see underwear and tummy.

They fit how I'd expect a large to fit. The shirt is weird. I'm normally a medium but this large is borderline too short on me. The arms are definirely too short too. By about 6 inches. It's also stiff. If I had paid more than $10 I'd be upset."
121,Ty's mom,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 2, 2022",Sleeves are very short,"Pants are comfortable, loose fitting. I am 5'4"", 130lbs. The top has very short sleeves.

128,Denise,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 22, 2021",Cute,I bought a medium and a small. My 4 and a half year old wears 6/7 he’s 45 inches tall and weighs 55 lbs. I thought the small would fit. But the top part of the pajamas in size small was too snug. The butt is too tight.... as for the medium. It’s way long on his legs but fits perfectly everywhere else. The shirt fits just right. And the waist fits right too.. In the picture he’s wearing the medium size. Hope these pictures help. I know the lack of size chart kinda makes it hard to know what to buy.

137,Satisfied Customer ,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 29, 2022",Nicely made,"This item is nicely made and the colors are vibrant. I purchased the large for my grandson who is 9, tall & slender. He typically wears a 10-12 but the large just fit him. I purchased two more pair in X-Large just in case of shrinkage. Overall I was pleased with my purchase but it might be more helpful if sizing also showed which sizes cover small, medium, large & X-Large for this product."
138,Rosanna,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 22, 2022",Size up!,I ordered a small for my 5 year old who usually wears 7 but it isn’t comfortable for him due to the size being very small/ constricted.

Really cute but not functional… was a nightmare to try and get his arms in the sleeves — not stretchy at all and not enough room with a regular cotton long sleeve underneath.  He’s a small baby, not really chunky, so this was disappointing… could try sizing up but I’m over it.  I’ll just use a ton of warm blankets or get a car seat cover."

The lining is so thick it doesn’t really have a lot of movement so my daughter cries the whole time I’m trying to put it on her. It’s also an awkward fit once it’s finally on. I can’t zip it up without covering her mouth and again because the lining is so thick she can’t put her arms down or move them well. Kind of like the little kid in a Christmas Story. I haven’t been able to get the hang of it but since I’ve already washed it, I’ll be keeping it."

174,Party of 6,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 1, 2021",Size up,Runs small. Nice and thick but made for a skinny baby. Also you wouldn't be a able to have a thick sweater worn underneath.

The 3-6 month size was a tight fit for my barely 3 month old baby, so definitely size up. As others have mentioned, the fleece is super plush/thick which is great, but the sizing is off and can be difficult to get baby’s arms in and baby can’t really wear any layers underneath."

Don't get me wrong the coat is nice, well made not cheap feeling. The only issue is, it's too big for the little baby. I guess depending on how big your infant is, it will fit."

I HATE THIS HAT... wth designed this thing... I've tried to alter it several times and I'm about to give up and toss it out.

255,Tildy,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 19, 2021",Not As Expected,"I expected better quality from Carters.  This just looked really cheap to me.  Part of the reason for that is because the fur got caught in the stitching when it was sewed, so the mittens are flat in places where they’re stitched instead of the fur being fluffed up."
256,Dee,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 22, 2021",Bad cut,The hat makes his head look weird! (very large at the top and narrow at the opening.) The mittens did not have thumbs.I rated one star because it did keep him warm - but I’ll have to buy another set because this isn’t flattering at all.

267,Megan,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 2, 2020",Weird fit,I really want to love this set. I do like the mittens. But the hat is the exact same in the front and back... so when you pull it down it goes over my sons face... it just doesn’t make sense. We tried rolling it up but it doesn’t stay.

The set arrived today and while the hat is cute and the whole set is super soft, to my disappointment, the mittens do NOT have thumbs (even though that is what is shown in the item picture).

I immediately contacted the company very upset via email who wrote back to me telling me that they had passed my message along and within a hour someone contacted me back apologizing offering to ship me new baby socks free of charge if I would give them a excellent review if I was satisfied with the new shipment! Claiming the first shipment may have been from a 3rd party. So we shall see if he actually received the new socks and if they still smell just as bad or deserve a outstanding excellent rating!

327,Amy Elizabeth,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 29, 2022",Huge… def not 0 months,None of these will fit your newborn… even 0-3 months is questionable… guess I have to find somewhere to store them for a while…I’m sure I will like them in 6 months or more… they were a good price with a large variety… just a false claim on size.
328,Brandi Uponen,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 20, 2021","They're good, for the price","I never realized how expensive baby socks were until my daughter outgrew her gifted newborn socks and needed new ones. These were a good quantity for the price, and I'm not unhappy I bought them. However, they aren't very stretchy or soft, so the 0-12m size leave slight marks on my 4m old's legs. I roll them over a bit and it helps some. Not confident they will fit her until 12 months, but decent socks for the price you pay."

We liked the quality--they seem soft and stretchy--but of course they haven't yet been baby-tested. There are a LOT of socks with pink, but it was nice that some were not pink.

They will go well with sneakers but not really with boots just because they are short socks which I did understand when I got them but thought I would reiterate if needed to know for best fitting purposes. I am happy with the amount of socks I got for the money too.
438,Ryan underwood,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 7, 2021",Unsure about sizing,"These are cute, durable socks. I knocked off one star because they do tend to shrink a bit after being washed. I was also unsure what size to order as my 23 month old is wearing a size 5t shoe and thought the 2-4t would be too big, so we ordered 12-24 mo and wish we would’ve sized up."

453,Zazu22,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 23, 2020",Really poor quality,"I have these onsies made by another manufacturer and love them, so I wanted more for my newest foster daughter who is pretty tiny. I didn't even look at the brand, but the Gerber ones are MUCH cheaper quality and really thin. I've very disappointed in the quality and will be sure to buy the other brand onsies in the future."
454,TessWes Mize,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 2, 2016",Much larger than other Gerber 0-3 onesies...no size consistency!,"Ordered this because my 2 month old is too long for newborn size but too small weight wise for 3 month size. The 0-3 short sleeve onesies we have from Gerber are the only thing that fits her so I figured the long sleeve style would be the same. The photo I'm posting shows the two styles, supposedly the same size, side by side. It is so frustrating that there's no consistency in baby clothes sizing, but one would assume that sizing would at least be consistent within the same company!"
455,Jess,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 22, 2021",Extremely small!,"Get these at least two sizes bigger!! I ordered the 3 month and open opening, they already looked too small, like newborn. I washed them once and they literally are now preemie size."

On top of that the material is very very thin. I'll stick with the Carter versions from here on as they are true to size, softer and thicker."
457,E.T.,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 1, 2016",These are TINY!,"I love the idea of having snap buttons and mitten cuffs. Other reviews have said that these run small, so I order the 0-3 months instead of new born size. They're still tiny. Pictures are included for you to see. I laid a shirt on top of the Gerber sleep n play. As you can see, both garments are labeled the same size, but the sleep n play is much bigger."

He just outgrew the newborn size of these, but the 0-3 month are barely any bigger! In fact, now that I’ve dried them, they look the same size.  They’re so tight around his bottom like the newborn ones were getting and too short to cuff his hands. The 0-3 month are the ones I wish I started him out on as a newborn. He’s 2 months old and I know all babies come in different sizes but 3 month onesies are normally big on him... These are just way too small. It’s a bummer bc I want those mitten cuffs and you just cant find them anywhere for 0-3. I want to return these, but seriously, what a bummer. I need some mitten cuff onesies!"
461,Emily Dahlquist,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 19, 2022",Poor quality fabric,Fabric is poor quality material. Thinner than most onesies. So thin it is transparent. Very low thread count.I got these onesies for the long sleeve/mits and they work well for that.
462,Amazon Customer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 6, 2021",Shrunk in the wash,"I got these for my newborn because I love the onesies with the mitten covers for when she sleeps. But the first time I washed them, before she even wore them, they shrunk significantly. I washed them with cold water and dried on very low. Had to return them because they wouldn’t fit her, and she is not a big baby."

466,Kellye,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 23, 2019",Too tight in the sleeves.,Was really excited to get these because of the mitten cuff on a 3 month onesie that i could not find in stores. I did not like that the closure only had two buttons instead of three. My baby looked like his fly was open all the time. Also the arms were very tight and pretty difficult to take on an off. Cheaply made and packaged compared to carters brand. I ordered two packages of these and unfortunately wont be using.

470,Dianna King,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 16, 2022",Runs Small,"Found out that Gerber items run small. If you have a very small preemie these are for you. But they will most likely not fit a 5 lb baby. However, the newborn size did fit our 5lb baby so size up."
471,Yellowbells,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 1, 2022","Good concept , awful material",The fabric is really rough and scratchy the mittens are a good concept
472,W,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 20, 2022",Nice but runs small,I ordered for my son since he was a bigger (length wise) baby and had to go right into 0-3 month clothes and I needed the hand covers but when I got them they ended up being to small. They are nice so I would recommend just sizing up.
473,CP,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 17, 2022",Was a gift.,"Sorry, can't give honest review...for our upcoming grand-twins!!!"

These barely fit her which is a bummer because we were looking for them to actually fit under her clothes during this winter. We were looking for mitten onsies since she's a newborn and scratches at her face. Would like to return them but we live an hour away from drop off center. If you have a smaller baby then these 0-3 would work as a newborn size.

482,Makenzie,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 25, 2022","Perfect for now, not sure they will last long!","These are perfect for my newborn who doesn’t like to keep mittens on and scratches his face. The only issue is the longevity of the onesies for my newborn. They fit perfect at the top but are tighter at the bottom and won’t fit for much longer depending on how fast he grows. He is just under 8.5lbs, so if you have a smaller newborn you will probably get to use them longer!"
483,Samantha Warfield,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 23, 2022",Great product but funky packaging literally,Exactly as expected soft cozy! Something odd tho the shirts were clearly brand new pure white pressed tagged.... but as soon as I opened the package it literally smelt like old baby formula!

484,KK1313,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"August 10, 2021","Fits a bit small, but does the job.","Purchased these as I was looking for long sleeved onesies with the mitts. As they are Gerber they run a bit small for the size, so I wish they had them in bigger sizes as well. They are as a bit thinner than some of the other brands of onesies, but they are soft and overall do the job."
485,Saul & Vivian Batres,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 16, 2021",SIZE 3-6MON. DOES NOT HAVE CUFFS,Great quality onesie. Only reason I gave it 4stars was due to the fact I thought I was buying the onsies with cuffs Size 3-6month. I did not bother to read description apperantly it says so. Anyways they only have cuffs on the size 0-3month so just know size 3-6mon wont have cuffs. Its my fault for assuming because of the photo it has cuffs. I wont return its good quality better then gerber. The down side is no cuffs.
486,Kimberly S.,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 18, 2021","Baby basic, but runs small",Great value but these run very small. Barely fit
487,Amber Fiacco,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 22, 2021",Love onesies,I love onesies and put them under everything my baby wears. For some reason I've got this package and one from Target and one onesie out of each was not sewn correctly on one of the mits which resulted in a open gap on the mitten part where it was separated from the sleeve. So overall these are amazing but disappointing that I couldn't use one with the mittens.
488,TRI,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 13, 2020",Runs small compared to other brands,"Everything is great about these except 0-3 feels more like newborn size compared to clothing of other brands such as carter's. I've ordered these in preemie also and they worked for our 5 lb baby however I would stretch it and pull on it quite a bit to button them, and same with 0-3 month ones. I stretch and pull to button my 8ish lb baby whose 1.5 months old. I decided to skip newborn and buy 0-3 so these would actually last me 3 months but they may be too small in another couple weeks.They do skrink in the dryer so that's another reason they run small."

The last time I wrote one was in 2015 when a product i purchased exceeded my expectation. However I have to write about this product because although I read the bad reviews I was hoping for better. I was absolutely disappointed and would like to spear others as well. The quality of this ""Gerber"" product is aweful. I would NEVER purchase this in a store had I felt the fabric and saw the stitching of this. First of all, the 4 pj's in the pack are not all the same size. 2 of them are at least a size and a half smaller than the other 2. I ordered new born this looks like its for a 6-9 month old. The fabric quality feels so cheap. I can tell it would not survive 2 weeks of wash and wear. I highly doubt this is an authentic Gerber, it said its made in Thailand. If it is its probably the defective products that are being sold at a cheaper price on Amazon so i guess you get what you pay for. I thought the glittery look was part of the fabric. Its actually glued on. I would NEVER put an outfit with the possibility of glitter falling off on a baby's new born skin. Or run the risk of it going into her eyes. LET ME SAVE U THE QUESTION OF WHETHER TO BUY OR NOT....DO NOT BUY unless you are ok with cheap poorly made quality on your baby."

Really helpful to parents upon arriving home from the hospital with a newborn, trying to quickly change sleepers after baby has peed through the first pair. Also this is baby #2 so we are not new to using sleepers… or zippers in general.  We are also not weightlifting world champions who don’t know their own strength.  This is just an extremely cheap product."
509,Elisabeth C.,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 23, 2022",Cute not comfy,"Ok so definitely cute. Who doesn’t love a cute baby 24/7?! *BUT* there are some buts.Pros:- cute. So cute!- footies AND mittens. Love mittens on PJs. Should be a requirement!- Zipper (I hate snaps) but zipper is only a top / one way zipper- Price - can’t beat it!CONS:- one way zipper that is only from the top. My baby HATES having her skin exposed when there’s a chill in the air in the middle of the night so having to expose her whole tummy when trying to change her diaper is not good.- Softness = 0/5. Baby clothes, especially pjs, are supposed to be soft! When I opened them I thought they were scratchy feeling, but I like this baby clothes brand so I took the tags off and washed them, thinking that they would just soften right up. Nope. While they are no longer scratchy, they still aren’t soft. Could be that they need a few more washes but very disappointing right out of the gate.-super thin. Great for summer not great for Colorado fall and winter.-They aren’t stretchy. This is neither here nor there for me really, but I know that this could be a big con for parents.I will come back and update my review if they dramatically change softness in the next wash or two (or three)."

I couldn’t believe when I opened up the package the amount of FUNK that came out. It smelled like a baby had boo booed, threw up on it, and they put them in the oven on 350,  and while it was still warm air tight sealed it,  then put it in the package and sent them to me. If it weren’t so cute, I would’ve sent it back!!!  I washed them and put them in the dryer with five fabric softener sheets to get the unGodly smell out.  I don’t know what y’all did, but please stop it, so we don't receive funky BABY clothes."

When our newborn sized up to 0-3 mo they had the cuff. However when we sized up again to 3-6 month they came without the hand cuff. This was the main reason I liked these - no sperate gloves! It shows it still being advertised as with cuff for all sizes. I feel jaded and ripped off. Oh well. Don't make the same mistake as I did - no hand cuffs in the 3-6 month size!

The two that have a large elephant / cloud have a very firm fabric there that doesn’t fold well for when baby moves. The fabric itself is very thin. I wish I bought better clothes for my baby.
523,Felicia Gregory,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 27, 2022",Runs large,"Got these for my baby because I didn’t think she would need much NB clothing, turns out she is tiny so ordered these but she is literally swimming in them. She’s able to get her legs out of the leg part and curl up. I compared these to cloud island (target brand) size NB and these run way bigger. Other then that they’re fine, she will just have to grow into them."

I got the 0-3 size and it fit like a 3-6.I got a premie size, and it was perfect until I washed it. It shrunk.So warning! It shrinks in the wash and I should’ve kept the 0-3 size since it shrinks anyways."
526,Fran Crane,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 5, 2022",Too big,Our daughter is 4 pounds 6 ounce and she was swimming in these. Even when she does reach 6 pounds the outfit may still be to big. Honestly newborn size and preemie size look the same.

529,Jenny Nong,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 23, 2022",Cute and great for the price,"I have a 2.5 month old and she is growing length wise like crazy so we've had to purchase several new sleep n' play footies to keep accommodating. These are a little thinner than I would have wanted for winter but the design and price are unmatched. I've learned that when buying baby clothes, read the size chart. Gerber tends to run a little larger/provides more room for babies to grow than some other brands. Now my baby has room to stretch out her arms and legs before we need to size up again.There were only 2 negative things I noticed after purchasing. Upon opening, there was this weird smell, almost like a chemical but it went away after washing the clothes. I washed the clothes twice to make sure there wasn't anything residual that got on my baby. The second was that with this pack of designs I didn't realize that the polka dots and the little castles were glitter. I didn't notice any glitter falling after wash or when she was wearing it so far  but also don't know if it will start peeling/falling off later on and hopefully my baby doesn't ingest any."

541,Underhills,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 5, 2022",Footed PJ's,"I got these for my 4 week old newborn so that I don't have to put socks on her at night, encouraging the serculation in her feet. I got size 0-3 month so she can grow into them. She wears them now and they are slightly big on her but they work wonderfully and she seems really comfortable in them. The built in mittens are very nice to keep her from scratching her face at night also. For reference she is 8.11 lbs and 22 inches tall. I would definitely recommend these and will purchase more sets for when she's older"
542,Sky,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 8, 2022",Runs big but good quality. I would recommend,My baby is 11lbs and it still big on her. So its definitely not your average 0-3mnths. But its a great purchase otherwise. I love it

565,AUashleyS,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 28, 2018",Crazy sizing,"I bought these pants based on others' reviews that they fit true to size/a little small, but WOW is that incorrect. I have a 25lb one-year-old who wears 18m in just about all pants and the 18-24m size in these were HUGE on him. Even with the drawstring waist, they have to be pulled so tightly I didn't even bother. It's more of a hassle to return them, given the low cost, so I'll keep them in hopes that he'll fit them eventually, but please know they run very large."

I sized down based on other reviews and they are still too large. The drawstring is ineffective at holding them in place resulting in the crotch sliding down to his knees.
571,Terese Persson,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 29, 2022",One size larger than stated size.,These jeans are very nice for easy take off and put on.  Please be aware they are at least one size larger than the stated size. They are worth purchasing. Just order one size smaller.

573,Labshiztu,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 24, 2022",So-so,There really is nothing special about this little pair of jeans. It's not true jean material and the material feels a little bit rough. The color is a weird blue..not really denim but more of a ashy dark navy in a knit material.

My only complaint is they are jean material which is good, I just wish they'd added a little more of a stretchy blend to the left portion.

Unlike the ones with the inner straps that pinch or bunch up on the hips, these jeans have a stretch waste, and a drawstring.  This makes it way easier for my son to get a snug comfortable fit and still be able to take them on and off for the bathroom.These are hands down my kids favorite jeans to the point he doesn't like to wear anything else and as a parent, they are fantastic.  I cannot recommend them enough.  They are also super durable, like normal denim, great for outdoor play and the price is perfect.My only complaint is that my son is about to outgrow them and there is no larger sizes beyond T5."

After one wash you could tell the fabric would not hold up for a long period of time. She has been wearing them for about 2 months (which she wasnt very mobile during majority of her use in them) and honestly they will go straight to the trash once she outgrows them. They are very faded, have significant pilling, and hold on to any stain imaginable. Also, they are not breathable and it feels like shes wearing plastic honestly. She has the other type that are cotton and those have held up much better and she seems cooler in them, though the fabric feels a little thicker. If you plan to buy these and are okay with them going straight to the garbage after their use, then get them. If you want to hold on to them for hand me downs then do not purchase!"
600,Theresa Hoffman,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 22, 2020","Bad fabric, Bad fit","I never once felt good about putting her in these because of the feel of the fabric.  It is not soft and whatever visual appeal there is from the cute print is quickly ruined because of it pilling when washed. If I buy polyester again it's going to be the  fleece, not this jersey stuff.As for the fit I don't like that it is only a half sleeve as I use these when it is cold and that leaves half of her arm exposed.  Also, I did not find them to be ""loose fitting"" longways. I bought size 12mos for my 6 month old who is about 18lbs, figuring she'd have some room to grow into these. She only fit them for a couple weeks before the crotch was too snug and would squish her diaper in the middle of the night so either I would catch her sleeping in a puddle or she would wake up because her clothes were all wet from the diaper leaking.  It took me 3 times of doing all this cleaning her up in the middle of the cold night when she's wanting to sleep for me to realize it wasn't the diaper it was this dang sleeper! I was happy with my other purchase of the cotton snug fitters those I got in size 18 mos which gives me enough room to get her in them and extra space for her thigh chunk."

It does not stretch and is not breathable. I didn’t realize they were not cotton until it was too late to return them. The feet are also HUGE. The rest fits but the feet are way too big! There is no 2 way zipper either. Between that and it not stretching it is NOT easy to get off of your baby.

We have hardwood flooring, and our poor girl is unable run in these without slipping. This is astonishingly poor. We've only had them for just a few weeks. The search begins for another brand. Shame.Original review: Great fit, very comfy fabric and my little toddler sleeps beautifully. I do feel she struggles to stretch as well as she'd have liked in these. Hence the 4 stars. I like them, and hence will keep these. But the next pairs of jams will definitely be stretchy! Unless she learns to tuck herself in under a blanket."

616,Russell zierenberg,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 13, 2020",Attracts hair like you wouldn't believe,"I loved these at first but after washing them a couple times I noticed how hair clings to the fabric. It's hard to pull all the hair off of too, it embeds in the fabric. I spent minutes searching through the fabric for hair, pulling out strands while my daughter fussed to be held. Thank goodness I bought these when my daughter was wearing 6-9 months vs newborn/ 0-3 because I lost so much hair in the beginning. I would have burned these out of frustration if I had them early on. $30 for 3 pairs of baby pjs because I liked the design but I never use them....I'm so scared of missing hairs and giving my daughter a hair tourniquet. She had a bad one on her toe when she was little before I heard about them. Not worth the money, not cute enough to risk another hair tourniquet."
617,Amanda Duckworth,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 11, 2022",Cheap,There was no bottom zipper so you have to unzip the whole thing to change a diaper. The legs were also skin tight and not loose as described. There is barely any stretch too. Not worth the cost.

I chose to go with these because I've been pretty happy with Carter's brand, but the size jump was ridiculous. I realize there was a slight difference in the branding, so after a quick Google search I found that Simple Joy's by Carter is Amazon exclusive which explains the inconsistency in size and difference in fabric... and the fact the Amazon exclusive brand quality doesn't quite compare to Target or Carters itself. I don't hate them, and hopefully in a few months my toddler will fit them. The fabric is extremely lightweight and breathable which will be great for summer in a few months. The patterns are adorable and when she finally fits into them we'll get some good use, it's just important to note that they run big and aren't as high quality as what you'll find directly through Carters or Target.. and if you're trying to size up from one of those Carter brands your best bet is to actually buy the same size (which I think I'm going to do.)"

I was disappointed with a few points that may have more reflection in the distribution offices of this product. 1st: the product came wrapped in a plastic bag to protect the product, which most products do, but that bag had been manually opened in the middle of the bag. It looks like someone ripped the bag open by pinching it in the middle and tearing it open with their hands. I don't have a problem if the item was returned from a previous order and then shipped to me, however they could have at least changed its packaging. 2nd: since there was a rip in the plastic bag, this allowed the jeans to get a greasy filth around the button of the pants and all around the belly rim area. See attached picture. Gross! 3rd: the jeans where a LOT darker than pictured. It's misleading."

These have worked out very well, the only problem I have found is the button is hard to clasp on his own and there is no zipper on the fly. Although, it does have an elastic waistband with adjustable buttons to help hold the pants up for children with no buts or not wearing a belt. I find those two features quite odd for toddler jeans..."
684,Theresa King,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 9, 2021","Okay, knees don't hold up very long","I've bought three pairs now, one in 3T and two in 4T. I love that they have the adjustable sizing bands inside the waist, and they seem very comfortable. Now the downside:  the first pair got two holes in the knees pretty quickly, but I figured it was because he fell while running on cement, twice. I ordered the 4T in May 2021 and only a few months later one of the knees has a hole in it. I don't remember any particularly hard play happening in these, so I don't know why they would be tearing. However, the price is hard to beat, especially when it's also shipped to your door -- very useful during this pandemic! I ordered another pair and they arrived Oct 24th, and by Jan 28th they already have a hole in one knee.  I could try patching them, but it's still a little frustrating."

I ordered the two pack with two distinct acid wash type colors and seeing them in person you can barely notice the difference between them - they are both a pretty deeply saturated blue. They are also somewhat unflattering once the waist is adjusted by only a few loops and look puffy on the hips. The fact that they were a good price and seem to be well made is why I'm giving 4 stars anyway.

They do not say Carter’s on the bottom, and they are not the same size as Carter’s socks. The seller is lying about the branding. It’s a “good” deal for the amount of socks, so it’s very deceitful that they would lie about the brand. These socks could have possibly been used (I ordered new) the pairs were not attached to each other with the little plastic piece. They were also just thrown in a bag. If you’re a stickler on brand these socks are not for you, if you’re looking for a good deal however, these are the socks for you."

When the first pair ripped on the first wear I shrugged. When the second pair did the same I had a bad feeling. The third ripped. The fourth ripped and I only put them on my kid for a nap.

However, we've had to throw out 3 pairs already for gnarly holes under the big toes, and the skid-free tabs on the soles have all come off. We wear socks indoors, and admit my son is really active and slides around hardwood floors in his socks and twirls on his big toe. But a few weeks worth of wear, I cannot recommend these socks and will not be reordering... at least not until we're back to wearing shoes to school."
711,Zelmgid,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 30, 2021",No grips!,NO GRIPS! I carefully read the Q&A to see if the 12-24 month socks had grips and Simple Joys stated they did. Sadly these do not and would be a disaster for a young walker on wood floors.
712,Crissy,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 22, 2020",Way too big,"These are labeled 0 - 3 months which is what I ordered, but they are clearly not. They are far too large. I’m not sure if this is a manufacturing defect or a labeling error, but they are easily 2 to 3 times larger than actual 3month size socks. A 3T maybe. Photo is attached with label, and another with a 0-3m sock and a quarter for reference.I didn’t even open them so I can’t speak to quality. The colors and patterns are accurate to what I ordered."
713,Jean B.,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 8, 2020",Size 2T/3T is way too big - sizing is off,"Haha. I should have listened to some of the reviews that talked about these being WAY TOO BIG. It’s true.  My son is two years old and wearing size 2T. I think these are made for at least a five year old. i’m guessing this is some kind of overstock situation and that’s why the sizing is off. Pic attached for where the heel is on him.We’re going to have him wear these at night, instead of returning them. They are soft and have nice and bright colors. I just wish the sizing was accurate. Now I have to find some 2T to wear in the daytime."
714,Janine,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 14, 2022",Huge,2t-3t is huge. Might return.  2 stars because they are cute.
715,LC,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 7, 2019",Not the same quality as before.,"I'm extremely disappointed with the change in quality in the materials that these socks are made of. The 3 pairs on the right were bought in May 24th, 2018 (1 1/2 year ago) and they have been used and abused by a toddler that walks in socks all over the house.The 3 socks on the left where bought in August 13th, 2019 (Not even 2 months ago) and they have been used by the same toddler that now goes to school, therefore he uses shoes more time. They look AWFUL. It immediately showed this bad after the first wash.Definitely not the quality that I was expecting."
716,LBF,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 13, 2020",Don’t stay up,"These socks seem to fit my 10 month old when first put on - but constantly come off his feet and never stay put. If I put booties over them, they stay on longer. I would recommend a taller sock or one with more grabby material that stays up. For the price point, they are not soft or thick at all. I’ll be donating all of these to charity."
717,Stats Dork,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 28, 2021","Not slip-proof, very stretchy",These have a little bit of cling but not enough to keep from slipping. Also they are very stretchy and don’t stay put. Won’t buy again.
718,Amanda,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 4, 2022",Not correct fabric information,They are only 70% cotton!
719,Bluebonnet Momma,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 28, 2022",Grippies or Grips not very helpful,"The quality of the socks are wonderful and my child loves the cute designs and prints, however I was displeased with their ability to help with slipping on hardwood floors and tile. The grips are not very big and they do not do as well as some other brands we have had in the past (hence the reason for 3 stars). If the product is advertised as ""non skid"" I would expect."
720,Amazon Customer,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 18, 2022",Too big,"These seem like descent socks. But sadly way too big. In this picture it’s a newborn sock, and I ordered size 0-3 month. There’s no way my 3 month old will fit into these, they look huge! I’ll keep them for when his feet are bigger, but I’m sad that they’re not actually 0-3 month, since he needs socks that fit now."
721,Cheryl Winkler,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 18, 2022","Way too big and a bit thin, but very soft",My son is a large 10 month old.  The 6-12 month socks are way too small for him so naturally I bought the 12-24 month size.  Unfortunately they are way too BIG!  I will keep them but he probably won't be ready to wear them for several more months.  No idea what to do in the meantime :/However they are soft and I think they will be good socks later on.
722,Jen B.,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 4, 2022",Too big,We bought these and have other carter socks the same size but these are clearly bigger than those and don’t fit. Only good thing is eventually they will fit
723,JLM,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 31, 2022",Not non-slip enough.,Socks are fine but we have hardwood floors and these just don't keep the little one from slipping on them. There is very little of the non-slip pads and they are mostly centered in the middle of the foot. Not sure about anyone else but my little spends most of the time on the ball or heel so these just don't work for us.
724,Jen K.,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 17, 2022",Not grippy enough,"I wanted to love these socks, which are made of high quality material, fit well, and have cute patterns. Unfortunately the gripper bottoms are pretty useless, and my son falls when running on our hardwood floors in them. We haven’t had this problem with socks from other brands."
725,Justin R. Rolling,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 29, 2021",Disappointed,"I was sorely disappointed to learn that these socks do not have grippers on the bottom. I purchased a different set of colored socks from Carter’s for an older child and had no issues. Now, I hope to find a child who can use these socks that may have carpeting throughout the home."
726,Catherine McKenzie,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 22, 2022",Run large,These are definitely more on the 3T end. Not the best durability for an active toddler. Got holes in the toes pretty quick despite being a little large. Great patterns and colors.
727,Victoria L Young,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 23, 2020",Just okay,"I purchased these socks from Amazon because they were from the Carter’s company, whom I typically buy from for my LO’s clothing, and I got more socks for less (when compared to the Carter’s website). These socks come with grippers on the bottom (which I didn’t realize when I purchased them) and my LO’s previous socks (from Carter’s, just a size down) did not. It took him some getting used to. They’re also not as tall as Carter’s socks I had previously purchased. I recently purchased some socks from the J Crew Outlet (size small) and they fit the same on my LO’s foot as the Amazon socks but they’re taller (which I prefer). I wouldn’t purchase these again as I don’t feel the quality is the same as you would get directly from Carter’s, my son didn’t like going from no grippers back to grippers and they weren’t tall enough."

729,Kckid89,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 17, 2022",Pretty good,"2T-3T size fits my son well who wears a size 8 shoe. The colors and patterns are cute. They stretch well and don’t stick up as high as you would expect. Pretty good quality, my son did rip a hole in one the first day he wore a pair, probably because there was a bouncy house at daycare and he was jumping around in his socks."
730,Prime Finishes,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 7, 2022",Order size smaller,Glad I trusted previous reviews on sizing. Thank you folks!  Ordered the 2T-3T for 3-1/2 year old. They are roomy but not too large. Nice colors and look very comfy. He wears a size 9-1/2 shoe. I anticipate the socks will fit through a couple more sizes because they stretch.
731,Liz Hutchison,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 19, 2022",Shorted one pair,"These socks seem great quality and color. I was shorted on pair though, 11 out of 12. I really don't want to send the whole package back for one pair."
732,Katie,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 29, 2022",Good socks - little small,"I love these socks because they’re high - good for a constantly-moving 16 month old boy. The grips on the bottom keep him from eating dirt every 2 minutes too. BUT, like most socks for little ones, the size is just a little small from toe to heel. It doesn’t effect the function of the sock and they don’t fall down because of it or anything, but I wish they were just a bit bigger so the heel would stay in place. I’d buy them again."
733,Marlene Coronado,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 20, 2022",Un poco apretados de arriba,Los calcetines son de buena calidad y si corresponden al tamaño; sin embargo me pareció que están más apretados de la parte superior en la pierna.
734,Rebecca Smith,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 29, 2020","Love the grippers on the soles, comfortable for my son and the elastic stays up","These were great socks for my son, aged 4.  Loved that they have grippers on the bottom since we have hardwood floors and are spending so much time at home.  The patterns are fun and colorful and go with everything.  Well made and the elastic holds the sock up well.  Not too much stitching on the inside given the patterns. My only complaint is that they did begin to shrink after multiple washings and we didn't get to wear them for as long as I hoped considering there are so many pairs in the pack.  They seemed to get small after only a few months.  Overall, good quality for the money and I would recommend as long as you don't expect to wear them longer than 6 months."
735,Troy,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 13, 2022",👌,-
736,small but mighty,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 16, 2020","Great socks- comfort, fit and pattern for a 2 yr old",Love everything about these socks. The patterns are nice and provide a great variety - my son can pick out a pair every day. They are soft and feel nice- not too thin and not too thin. I do think they will be great for cool temperature/ early winter temperature ( Chicago weather). The only reason for 4 stars vs 5 ( and really 4.5 stars) is that one pair already came with a hole in the ankle portion. They have not been used yet so that was disappointing. However I do love them so I am keeping them.
737,Jessica W,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"June 10, 2021",A little big but room to grow,"My kiddo has pretty big feet for 2-3T, and these were a bit large on him. But I consider that a plus so he can grow into them and I don't have to buy more socks for awhile. Just a heads up."

I got the 6-9 months size which has been fitting bigger on him in other clothing that size so I thought it would be okay. Tried to button the shirt all the way up to the neck because he had a bow tie to put on for his pictures and it was way too tight. So tight that it would've choked him. Unfortunately, the shirt was a last minute buy and I didn't have time to return it or buy another one before his pictures so he had to take them without the bow tie."

In the pic I'm holding one from the 0-6 mo pack over the 6-12 mo pack. This is absurd!

The pair with the highest cotton content is 69% cotton only and the rest mostly have only about 27% cotton in them. I'm very very disappointed with Carter's, a brand that I trust most among others. The only reason I got these socks were their blends stated on the description and that was a complete lie and deception."

I bought these needing some thin cotton socks for my daughter and Carters has a reputation for quality but these socks don't live up to the brand. I've had them about 2 weeks and only dry them on medium heat but they have started coming apart where they are embroidered with designs.

She likes the designs so we are keeping them. The picture with 2 socks has a sock from Walmart size 2-4 that fits her perfectly versus the carter sock on the right. Gave 4 stars due to being so big and she can’t use them yet.
834,L Brown,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 3, 2022",Good amount for the money,I liked how the socks did not have the little white tag things. stapled through them. I had no problems with shipping or how they came. Good price for the amount especially since buying for twins. They have washed well.
835,Sparky,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 21, 2022",Good basic socks,These are good basic socks. They are nice neutral colors (which I like) and they're a good value. The stitching finishing could use improvement. There are some gathered threads and stray threads.

The only reason for a 4 star instead of 5 is that they are much larger than expected.

839,PNg,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 7, 2022",Socks on or off?,"These socks are absolutely amazing! I never knew socks could be so funny, but these ones had me laughing from the moment I took them out of the package. The white and grey are a nice neutral color, and the pink add a touch of whimsy. But the real reason these socks are so great is the fact that they don't stay on your feet for more than a few seconds. As soon as your little girl looks at them on her feet, those socks will be flying off her feet like they're on fire. It's like a never-ending game of sock toss. So if you want to keep your toddler entertained for hours (and drive yourself absolutely bonkers in the process), these are the socks for you!In all seriousness, though, these socks are great. They're made of high-quality materials that are soft and comfortable, and they're designed to fit snugly without being too tight. They're also super durable, so they'll hold up well to all the wear and tear that comes with being a toddler's socks. And the best part is, they're machine washable, so you can toss them in the laundry and they'll come out looking like new.Overall, I highly recommend these grey, white, and pink girls' socks. They're cute, comfortable, and lots of fun. Your little girl will love wearing them, and you'll love watching her run around with them on. It's a win-win situation!"

I aired them out before giving them to the recipient. (didn’t help) The material is very thin and dare I say, scratchy just like adult Amazon brand tops are - if you’ve ever purchased one.  Extra fabric strings had to be cut off garments. One tag for four pieces of clothing. Disappointed."
850,Karina,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 12, 2022",Horrible quality and smell,I would give this product 0 stars if I could. The quality of the fabric seems extremely cheap and thin like a bedsheet. It also seemed too harsh to be worn by a baby. The whole package had a HORRIBLE smell like mildew or plastic that has been out in the heat for a long time. I did not take any chances and threw it all away. Didn’t even bother to wash it. Go with Carters instead. A bit more expensive but worth it.
851,ashton bell,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 5, 2022",Not correct size for preemies,Having a preemie and the shock of the baby coming early should not be accompanied with I’ll fitting clothes you need in a hurry. These are way too large to be preemie sizes. Even with my baby meeting the weight and size requirements of their sizing the ones received are way too big
852,Amazon Customer,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 6, 2022",Zippers broke before use,"two of the four pajamas had broken zippers before my baby even got to wear them. the first one he wore was fantastic, no issues, a little thinner than i had thought they would be.. but then as i went for the second and third the zippers feel so cheap they just pull apart and the pajamas cannot be zipped shut.  real bummer! overall just a really cheap-feeling product."

Sizing chart even says we should order newborn size. It was WAY too big, fit almost close to 3-6 month on him. We tried anyway because walmart didnt have any and we needed more. He's very kicky, so he got tangled up and caused a meltdown. Material was also very flimsy and smelled like a costume. Wouldn't recommend"

It’s like they reached into a return bin and just threw a few onsies in a shipping bag. I wish I could make this up! No feet in my baby’s jumpers. Ugh. So frustrating!! Especially for a first time mom expecting these to be here and intact. I had to call amazon and they resent. Threw out the 3 without feet. They do not stretch. They are not soft. They’re cute though."
856,seattleite,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"April 3, 2022",Disappointing,"I bought a set of Gerber pajamas in size Newborn at Target and loved them. I thought these ones from Amazon would be similar since they are the exact same brand, but I was wrong. Not only are the Amazon Gerber pajamas way too large, but the material is also completely different. The Target ones are soft and stretchy, while the Amazon ones are stiff and thin and cheap-feeling. The material feels like a Halloween costume.The photo shows the Target outfit versus the Amazon one. The one on top is size Newborn and the one below is supposedly 0-3 months (should be marginally larger but instead is closer to 6-9 months)."

I had my husband double check to make sure it wasn't my pregnancy nose and he confirmed they smelled terrible like they had gotten wet and then sat in a warehouse for who knows how long. When you buy something new you do not expect it to arrive in this nasty condition. Would not recommend.

The most recent pack I bought, however, aren’t great. The zipper gets stuck often and eventually continues to pull. The problem is, once it starts “working” again, it doesn’t actually close the zipper. It’s very frustrating and has happened on 3 of the items."
865,Eva P,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"September 3, 2022",Strong horrible odor,"These seem fit a little looser than other newborn size onesies we’ve used, but the length works for our guy.

866,Judy,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"October 7, 2022",Weird fit for feet,"I bought the newborn size for my grandson's first 3 weeks because he was too little for 0-3 months.

I thought they would be a little thick for this winter but they're not. I bought 6-9 months for my 5 month old so some are a little loose on the leg part but not too much as he will still grow in to them.

The designs are cute and the quality is pretty much the same as the main Carter's label.  Sizing too is the same.This design is cute, and very familiar like most of Carter's designs. The hoodie and pants are fleece polyester while the bodysuits are 100% cotton. You know how manufacturers always sell mhltipacks and only 1 piece is cute and you get a boring 2nd design of the same style? This is the same case here, I wished the 2nd bodysuit had a single fox patch or something rather than a tiny square patch that says ""adventure awaits "" to match the overall theme and for a cute factor on its own."

I decided to put these jammies on her, in 12 month size (she is only 8 months) and the pants (rainbow) fit fine, if a little snug/small, but the shirt, while loose in the body, has a neckline that is fine on one side while the other side js pulled almost off her shoulder, and the sleeve cuffs were ridiculously tight, to the point that I just had to decide if I should risk waking her up fully and potentially hurting her to get them off, or grab my craft scissors and snip the cuffs. Guess who now owns a torn sleeve unicorn expert shirt. 🤦Edit to add: I put in some photos showing the 1/4"" difference in shoulder seams and the comparison of the sleeve on the unicorn shirt to the other short sleeve shirt in the set which fit her fine if not a little big."

We already had a similar set from Carter's that our toddler loves, and we thought the strawberry/llama print looked cute. What we didn't know was that the designs are covered in glitter THAT SHEDS EVERYWHERE. An entire load of laundry was left sparkly. The loads after still bear the residue (including uniform items that absolutely cannot be glittery). On top of the STI of crafting invading our clothing and home, these 5T pajamas are longer than our other 5T Carter's pajamas. Our toddler was tripping over the extra long legs. Super disappointed. Two of the three pairs should be thrown away because I wouldn't want to pass this mess on to some unsuspecting, tired parents--like us."

It looked like it was sewn basically all the way up, except big enough for 2 not even 3 fingers to go into, my daughter was super excited, and unfortunately we have to return them, because the arms just wouldn't fit, now I know some of you are saying ""you could just cut the sleeves a bit"" but its the principle, and I didnt pay almost $27 for these items to come defective and have to cut on them.

The glitter is on the monkey face on one of the pj tops; totally separate from the sparkly silver half moon on the top. Why on earth would the manufacturer place glitter on pajamas, much less glitter that falls off and coats everything else?

My little one is 14 mos and petite. She still wears a size 12mos in carters but they are just perfect, as in grow out of those in like a month or so. Figured I’d start buying next size up- 18mos. Didn’t realize simple joys by carter would be so different than actual carters. I have a pair of 18mos pants that can fit her today. However these 18mos pants are ridiculously baggy and like double the length of the other one. She is swimming in them. It’ll be many months before they actually look normal on her.

I was super disappointed when they arrived and I noticed they had gray dust on them. After taking a close look (and whiff), they smelled so musty and moldy.  I also recently purchased a pair of Arctix snow boots, and the box arrived EMPTY.  I'm not sure who is at fault for that one, but Amazon was quick to remedy the problem. However, after TWO failed attempts at trying to acquire quality goods from Arctix, I suppose it's time to move on from this brand."
1101,Liege M. Gonzalez,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 24, 2017",Straps don't snap on and off,"The straps in these pants don't Snap-on and off, as with most other pants of this kind. This means that when your toddler wants to poo in the ski slopes, you will have to remove his coat in order to pull down his pants in the tiny filthy freezing Ski Lodge cubicle. Even if he only wants to pee you will also have to do that since the zipper won't come down to his crotch. The material and finishing are excellent, these are good quality pants, but I give it one star because this is a major design flaw for me. I wish someone else had written a one-star review like this because I would not have bought it if I had known. Ive never had pants with no snap ons so it didn't occur to me to check before buying. I don't have time to return them before my next ski trip so Let's hope there will be no accidents in the cubicle.  That's also hope Arctix reads this review and and snap-on's in their pants, because they do make good snow gear."
1102,Ann Johnson,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 25, 2022",Horrific mold smell,"I never write reviews but these snow pants were awful due to a terrible mold and mildew smell. As soon as I took it out of the plastic packaging, I could smell it. And someone sitting across the room could smell it. A truly disgusting and alarming odor.  Hopefully just a fluke or one-off, but wanted to post a warning here to others, just in case. I will return/request a refund."
1103,Allie Gavin,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 19, 2022",Terrible quality,"My son wore these 2 times. The second time he was playing out in the snow and slid on his knees and they completely ripped…not just the outer layer but all the way through. I am very disappointed, and does not seem like I am eligible for a refund because I cannot return them in the condition they were sent to me. I’m hoping Amazon can make this right…"
1104,ZG,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 23, 2016",Falsely advertised,"NO POCKETS - which would not bother me, except that they state on the tag and packaging: ""zipper pockets"" and ""hand warmer pockets"".Also, I ordered 4T, the tag says ""4T"" and the tag on the inside is for 3T!So where are the pockets? Why the mislabeling? I'm not a fan of false advertising, so it makes me not trust the product or company. Will be reutrning.Also, the pants aren't that great anyway:No zippers at the bottom, no bungees to tighten, very limited size adjustment option, no fleece/soft lining. The features/design is really limited. The ones we are replacing from Children's Place were about the same price and had many more features and better design."
1105,David S.,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 17, 2021",Terrible quality,"I am shocked these snow pants have so many good reviews. I usually buy my kids Columbia snow gear, but decided to save a few bucks and try these. My son has worn them for about a month and every time he wears them, his pants underneath get soaking wet. The other day he walked by a branch and the pants ripped wide open. Not made for New Hampshire winters, total waste of money!"
1106,Beatriz,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 16, 2021",Defective: Short Straps,"I bought the BLACK 18 MONTHS for my 11 month old (he is average in height) thinking it would last him long for a while. The suit doesn't fit him even if I extend the straps to the maximum (not very elastic straps either by the way), he was crying because of the tightness. The leg's length/size is fine though, but doesn't matter, this suit is absolutely defective."
1107,PartridgeFamily14,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 24, 2022",CAN'T GET RID OF THE SMELL!!,These snow pants must have been stored in a moldy storage facility because it reeks!  I have washed these snow pants SEVERAL times and cannot get rid of the smell.  I would NOT recommend these snow pants.
1108,Top Contributor: Baby,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 24, 2021",No free returns,I liked the product but when I got it it didn't fit my one year old. I wanted to make an exchange and there is option for that beside returning it. It says free returns but I have to pay to return it.
1109,lisbeht,1.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 4, 2020","Too Small, great quality (runs small) size up","I bought the 24 month size for my toddler who is a little 2 years old and a little over 32"" and when the overalls were on and it was time for the straps to be over his shoulders, it was way to tight by the crotch area and i loosened it to the max, SIZE UP! so what ended up doing was zipped it up to his mid stomach so he wore them like high waist pants and left the straps out."

1111,Megan,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 19, 2022",Runs small!,These run super small! My 2 year old is not tall by any means but even with the straps at their longest length they barely fit over her shoulders
1112,Amazon Customer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 6, 2022",Short torso,Very cute! But had to return. The torso was just way too short for my toddler.
1113,Mickey,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"May 12, 2022",Not for tall torsos!,"Although they held up well to the cold and wet not matter how much I loosened the straps my kiddo had a perma-wedgie. The torso area was extremely short, I had even sized up for my toddler so I was a little disappointed. If your kiddo has ANY sort of above average height, do NOT get these. They are more for the short skinny kiddos. My 3 year old wears a 3T, he is a whopping 32 pounds and about 3 feet tall and these in 4T still ran too short. I dunno if it was just the pair I got or what but he was not having it."
1114,Amazon Customer,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 16, 2022",Too small,Ordered a 2T and the size is same as 12m.
1115,halee,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 5, 2022",Wrong size,"I ordered the blue set in size 4T and they came just in time for some snow fun. Too bad I received a size 10/12 (which isn't even an option on this listing) so they were completely useless and my little girl was bummed. Now the price is way up from when I bought them also. They seem decent quality, wish it would have worked out."
1116,recia smith,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 9, 2022",Zipper came broken,Opened the package held it up to my son and was going to have him try it on.  Zipper is stuck and won't unzip so he can. Despise having to return things because it's so far to a ups store so I'm out the money.
1117,Christine Lawrence,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 8, 2021",Smelled of mildew/mold out of the package.,"Received package. Box wasn't damaged and bag looked ok but once I opened the bag, the snowsuit smelled horrible. Smelled like mildew/mold. Tried washing a couple times and still has a slight mildew smell."
1118,Rachel Aardal,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 29, 2020","OK for the price, but you get what you pay for..","First off.. I selected ""like new"" condition and received a VERY used article of clothing. There was even a name written on the tag in big black letters. I ordered up a size so that my 10 month old can hopefully wear it again next season- bought the 18 month. It surprisingly fits fine, just long (as expected) so I will fold the legs a bit and cuff. But even more surprising was that it fit perfect around his waist! My little dude is tall (100 percentile) and lean (only 26th percentile for weight).. so anyone with a cute chunky little baby may have difficultly fitting into these. Can't imagine it fitting well if he had any chubbiness to him."
1119,David,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 18, 2021",Size up!,"Bought 12 month size for our almost 1yr old, who can still fit into 9-12mo clothing. When putting the overalls on they looked great until trying to put the straps over his shoulders. I lengthened the straps as much as they would allow, still no good. It was way too tight in the groin area and there was no way he could sit/stand up straight. Ended up using them as high waisted pants."
1120,Chris and Amber Middleton,2.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 19, 2020",Runs SMALL,"received these pants for my twin girls (16 months old) They are on the petite side, so i was debating on the size. I ended up going with 18 months and thought they would be huge on them but would allow them to grow into the pants buuuut they were incredibly too SMALL! I return them and now waiting for the 24 months size. Hoping to have better luck with those. Material is great though! Although, it also advertises pockets but there are no pockets on the black ones... not that important to me though since they don’t use pockets lol"
1121,Sir Arthur,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 5, 2022",Snug fit,"As others have mentioned, get the size up. My kids usually wears a 2t and the 2t/3t was barely big enough. He is 33.5"" tall. He also has quite the beer belly but this was no problem....then again it could've been the reason why it is tight in the butt area."
1122,R.B,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 22, 2021",No pockets,"Okay. So the tag that is attached to these snow pants says there's zip pockets AND hand warmer pockets. There are zero pockets on these. There's another tag that says it can keep you warm from -20° to 35°. I'm not sure how much I believe the rest of the info, considering two of the advertised features are false. If you're wanting pockets, pass on these."
1123,rmd440,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 30, 2022","Great looking warm pants, size runs small","Nice snowpants for warmth, runs smallI ordered 12mo size for 11 month old child, but was to small. We could not zip it up with the straps fully extended was so short throughout the torso  . So disappointing because it is nice material and looks cute."
1124,Ethan gamble,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 29, 2021",Not bad,"I was super excited to get these since my area its really hard to find snowpants in the size I need (weird for northern Minnesota but oh well 🤷‍♀️). They looked cute and good quality, but they DEFINITELY run small. I got the 18 month for my 1 year old and it's a snug fit with no room to grow."
1125,Cosmiccatoe,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 13, 2022",Runs small,"I went off of the infant size chart in their pictures. I couldn't even get the straps over her shoulders because the torso was too short. I didn't notice this until after I pulled the tags off, so now I can't return. Runs very small!"
1126,Drew Novelli,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 21, 2022",Cute but smells awful,Item looked as described but had such an awful smell to it right out of the package. I do not want my daughter to wear anything that smells like that. Will be returning.
1127,T.Smith,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 20, 2021",Color not as shown,"I’m very disappointed. These bibs have great reviews, but I won’t even get to try them b/c the color we ordered is way different than the color shown. They are very hot pink & do not match the jacket I bought them to go w/."
1128,Annon,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"February 16, 2020","Nice, waterproof pants but cuff ripped off after only a few uses.","The first time out I wanted to love these snowpants. In fact, I DO love them. However, tonight while putting them on to go sledding we discovered that there was a rip at the cuff of his right leg. Is it a huge deal? No. Is it super annoying? Absolutely.Also, my toddler is devastated that his snowpants are ""ruined"". He's worn them only a handful of times this year and today, 15 days after the return window closed, they are ripped.Apparently there's no way to contact the seller except to leave a review so here's hoping they get in touch with me to figure out a solution. I spent good money on brand new snowpants so that they would LAST not so that I could buy a second pair halfway through the season.His older brothers snowpants (same listing just a bigger size) are perfectly fine. Both pairs are waterproof and warm. Literally my only issue is that the little dudes pants ripped and aren't fixable."
1129,Ron W.,3.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"July 14, 2021",Received 4 months after order date,"The product seems to be of high quality, but we received the item 4 months after we ordered. The return window ended 1 month after the order date, so we are stuck with something that doesn't fit and is out of season. Would have liked a way to contact the seller and explain the situation because the item is no longer needed, but there was no way to on the site. Also would have liked a better heads-up that the order would take so long to fulfill."

1133,Christa,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 30, 2022",Not great for chunky babies,"Love these snow pants overall but if your baby has a nice little potbelly on them, you might want order a size up. Length will be plenty long (I have a tall baby) but you can always roll the pants. We originally had the 18 month (as a 12 month old) and the front zipper was always a little too snug. We just left it unzipped and put her jacket over it, but we had to go up to a 2T when winter really got rolling."
1134,law student,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 2, 2022","Very warm/dry, but maybe order a size up","My son seemed to love these, he seemed comfortable and warm, but I would suggest ordering a size up. My son is just starting to get into 2T (still fits in 24 month in pants) so I ordered the 2T but these seemed a little tight around the crotch area, not enough to make it uncomfortable for him and he was still able to move around, but I expected them to be a little bit bigger.I will say that he stayed dry with these and his boots so I was very happy to see that he could have fun and warm/dry."
1135,Rebecca,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 31, 2022",Good value but sizing is off,"In terms of warmth and water resistance, these worked well. However, I ordered a size 24mo for my 18mo child (who typically runs a little smaller for her age) and the snow pants from crotch to shoulder were just barely long enough. One good growth spurt and they will be too small. I purposely ordered the larger size to fit over layers and be sure I could use them for one full season and I’m not sure how possible that is."
1136,D garcia,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 7, 2022",Good,It seems like good quality but it same with a mark on it. I tried to get it out with some dawn and a washcloth but it seems as if its glue of some sort and is not going to come out. So that sucks but seeing as we had to use it the day we got it we couldnt return for a different one.
1137,Em,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 22, 2022",Came dirty and used but will work for what i need.,This will work for what i bought them for and they did fit my son. (I got the 5T. He’s 47 lbs)But they came in an open package and have definitely been worn which is a little bummer.
1138,Mary C Dennis,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 8, 2022",Really fits exactly true to size,"Ordered a 3T for my 3.5 yr old and they weren’t kidding about it being exactly true to size - it was decidedly too small for him. He just went through a growth spurt and although he has too tiny a waist for 4T he needs the length. Return was no sweat, 4T should be here any day. He was very annoyed i wouldn’t let him keep it as other than the length it fit him well. Seems very warm, i am pleased."
1139,Amazon Customer,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"January 10, 2022",Colors are a little off,"We bought 3 pairs for our 2, 3 and 4yo boys.  The pants are nice but will most likely only last one season.  One wear and a knew is already stained with a hole.The orange actually looks pink.  The red isn’t really red.  The only one we actually like is the lighter orange that’s actually orange!  Next time we will stick to darker colors…but they were a bit delayed in shipping!"
1140,Shannon Henry,4.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"March 26, 2022",Buy a size bigger than you need,They run small and don’t have any type of adjustment feature. Buy a size bigger and you should be good
1141,Bridget,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 21, 2022",Other that that concern of mine these are great!,"Update****We love these overalls! We used them a couple of times and they keep my baby warm. My son loves them too! I can tell he is comfortable in them.  I was worried the suit would be uncomfortable but it has stretch to it on the shoulder straps that fixed the concern I had in the beginning. I would definitely recommend.****We love these snow overalls. We have not used them outside yet but they look durable and good quality. My son is 15months and he is 30in tall and weighs 25lbs, we got him the 24M size. They fit perfectly (just a tad bit long in length) but they maybe good only for this winter season or if he goes through a growth spurt in the next couple of weeks they may not fit him anymore or perhaps they will since the straps on the shoulders are elasticity. My concern with this is if he grows it may be uncomfortable in the area between his legs. Other that that concern of mine these are great!"
1142,Biochemliz,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"November 30, 2022",Excellent bibs... Even in subzero Alaska temps!,"We purchased these for a trip to Alaska in December 2021. They were worn 13 out of 15 days for all kinds of adventures... Sledding, ice skating, sleigh rides, dogsledding, and even Northern Lights hunting a few nights. We dressed the 3yr old in leggings and a long sleeved shirt, and put these and a good coat over top. She never once complained about being cold. Now, time to find these in a bigger size for the older kiddo. Absolutely recommend!!"
1143,Courtney Smith,5.0,the United States 🇺🇸 ,"December 14, 2022",Nice but run small,"Great quality - but I would highly recommend sizing up. I bought a size 12M for my toddler.
