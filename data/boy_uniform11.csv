The barcode said 4 but the shirt itself was a 6 as did the outside plastic packaging. I ordered a replacement. No big deal, minor frustration that we didn‚Äôt get the shirt when my son wanted to wear it. Replacement shirt came today. Same deal. Barcode/sticker said 4, shirt and packing say 5.

The first one was dirty and the inside of the bag had something in it.  I started to send it back but decided to run it through the wash first.  It came clean and was fine so I kept it.  Had this size not been so hard to get I would have just sent it back.  The second one came in and was fine, no issues."
23,Daniela,3.0,the United States ,"October 16, 2021",Size differs,These are way too big. Ordered the same size as few months ago and these are much bigger.

28,J. Levy,3.0,the United States ,"May 14, 2016","Nice for almost one year, until they wore out","Nice in all ways except that the fabric gets knotted and old/ worn looking after maybe 4 months of gentle machine washing. So for school uniforms these worked great until they looked old (they also stain and since I don't use bleach that is an issue). After the school year I threw them out and bought light blue tops that are more of a dress shirt style fabric. For a very young child that does not yet know how to button his shirt these are good. Also, the sleeves are not quite to the wrist, which is good for young kids keeping sleeves cleaner and out of their work. The fabric is soft, comfortable, and tagless so kids like wearing them. The length was also perfect. The price was great too. They can last a full year if you wear a sweater vest over it during the colder days, which we did. So, these were our school uniforms for one year."
29,Mariazh22,3.0,the United States ,"November 7, 2020",Not as described,"I have bought this shirt for my son's school uniform. However, it is not a perfect quality fabric. Have shrunk a bit already already after first wash on a delicate cycle, and now it doesn't fit my son so well."
30,HighStandardMama,4.0,the United States ,"October 17, 2022",Better buy on Amazon then Frenchtoast,"First - Frenchtoast website is a ripoff! Terrible site and pissed that schools still use them. Their pricing is inflated/too high. That being said, I ordered from here instead, MUCH better pricing (just no embroidery options). Fit as expected. Updated: Quality is good on this one, washed multiple times and still looks good (be careful with dryer, there is some shrinkage).Ordering here was much better than dealing with the Frenchtoast website and their hours long customer service that sucks.(ordered for 3yr old, 33lbs, fairly tall)"

Size 20 pants are hard to find. They fit well, but upon folding the laundry, I was very disappointed.  They look like they were rolled on a lint ball.  The whole garment is covered in tiny fibers.  It has become the pair he wears when there is nothing else left to wear.  I do not recommend, especially for a uniform that would be worn often.  We like Dickies brand much better."

The pants came wrapped in plastic with the tags. Upon unwrapping the pants I noticed small white to gray spots on the pants which looked similar to mold( not really sure what it is..just my assumption). I opened up all 4 pairs that I purchased and all had the spots. I washed them and they came out. Has anyone else had this issue with the pants?

80,Gabrielle D.,4.0,the United States ,"July 14, 2020",Good fitting pant for school and casual dress,"Nice brushed cotton (98%) and fits well on my average shaped boy.  After three washings, lining on the knees is not yet compromised as experienced with another brand.  Hang or fold quickly after drying reduces wrinkles and is easy to iron.  The seam allowance on the back pockets creates an area which will stress the material and eventually tear, but how soon depends on the quality of the material (which seems good) and how much that seam is pressed against the pant.  THIS IS INHERENT TO THIS STYLE OF POCKET.  Other brands with this style of pocket have worn out quickly in the same spot.  In the picture the lighter color vertical line is the wear spot.Delivery was FAST! Have purchased this brand and style previously and he outgrew them before he could wear them out (~ 6 months of wearing/washing weekly)."

Well the day comes and my son is literally squeezing himself into these pants. We actually had to get him to suck in his gut so that I could clasp them for him.  (of course i had let them out as far as they could go.) His private parts were almost outlined for all to see. he wore them that day because we had no choice. that was miserable and he had a bad stomach ache at the end of the day. I bought husky sizes dickies just to get us through until i can find another brand that fits, which is amazing considering my son is only 61st percentile in weight and 50th in height!

I'm definitely sending them back. They do seem to be well made as far as quality. It's hard to find pants without the double knees.

I wouldn't wear them.Honestly, if I had had time to order something else, I probably would have. But I didn't.

They flare out a bit at the bottom (boot cut style). I wish they were fitted a little better for a sharp look but we made it work. Seemed to be a good value as they are nearly impossible to find in-store, as well as overly priced in-store. We purchased a size 18H originally which was too large then settled for 16H because anything smaller would be too small and a size up would be too big. Still fit good at the waist but too large through the legs and too wide (for my taste) at the ankles."

I got a khaki pair and a black pair and both on the day of school were way too small. They buttoned, but his tummy was squeezed tight at the top, so I returned them and ordered a size up. I receive both pair again, same shorts just a size up and am sure I am good this time only to try them on and the black pair fit, but khaki size won‚Äôt even button!! It‚Äôs like the size 10 khakis were smaller than the size 8 khakis!! I put them up together and compare. Both pairs are size 10 and are identical shorts only differ in color and you can clearly see that the khakis are waaay smaller than the black pair. Idk if these were labeled wrong in the warehouse or what, but I‚Äôd say definitely order a size up. I use to go through this with my oldest daughter when she was younger and wore a uniform I‚Äôd have to order all her French Toast brands one to two sizes up. I thought it was just her, but nope.

So we started a return and ordered a 14....which fit exactly perfect, without much growing room. I tried to get him to return those and find a different brand because I also felt like the material was bulky and kinda scratchy. However, he bought them with his own money for school and it starts in a couple days, so he just really wanted to keep them. They are ok shorts. They work, but just know that you may have to size down."

He's been really picky about shoes (everything is too loose or too small), I bought these about a half size too big since he has wide feet, and he has not complained about them at all and willingly puts them on."

802,C. Cresta,5.0,the United States ,"October 27, 2013",Flat feet are happy,"My son loves these shoes & he has flat feet & has to wear orthotic inserts. In-spite of the orthotics his foot sits in the shoes comfortably & at the correct height. We live in SE Asia where it's hot & humid all year round & he isn't complaining about having heavy or hot shoes as these Geox have a ""breathable"" sole & are light weight 100% leather. These are school shoes, so they go on at 6am & don't come off until he returns home at 4:30pm Mon to Fri, he's 9 years old, very active & says they're the most comfy & easiest shoes to put on & take off that he's had. There's the added bonus that they're without laces & he doesn't have to hear me say ""do up your laces, or you'll get hurt"" anymore. He has also stopped complaining that his feet hurt since wearing these Geox shoes."

Great quality I expect from Geox, and my son thinks they're comfortable. I originally tried the Geox William shoe because I like the style of it better, but it didn't work with my son's orthopedic inserts. These, however, are perfect.

The material is not as described,"I will start by stating; I should have read the reviews before making this purchase.  I did not, so, shame on me!  These shoes are of very poor quality.  The material is not as described, so, shame on Amazon.com for that one!  Now that I have given a tongue lashing to myself and to Amazon, it is time for Deer Stags, shame on you!  If you click on the image, you should be able to see the materials label.  It reads ""Upper: Simuleled Leather"", ""Balance Man Made Materials.""  I had to laugh twice in disgust.  Firstly, the manufacturer did not spell check the word and misspelled Simulated.  Secondly, to say ""Balance Man Made Materials"" is redundant.  It could have easily said that the shoe was 100% man made.  I won't go on with a diatribe over the use of a Chinese fabricator (Made in Wenling, China) by an American Company founded in 1929.  I will say that this shoe purchase was an epic failure.  Not only were the shoes poorly made, they did not fit well to boot, no pun intended.¬†

We bought them for our middle school-er for a band concert but they are versatile enough that he will be able to wear them for any dressy or semi-dressy occasion until he outgrows them (which will probably be in two weeks with the way he grows).  The shoes look sharp, have a timeless, non-trendy style and were comfortable to wear according to our 12 year old.  We actually bought these in a larger size as a replacement for a pair he had outgrown...our younger boys will inherit the older smaller sized ones which held up well for the five or six times he wore them."

When my son went to put the shoes on again for his first day back at school the synthetic toe caps had separated from the leather in places, and completely collapsed and hardened so he couldn‚Äôt even get his feet into the shoes any more. I was really disappointed with the poor design and shoddy materials used as I had always thought Geoxx were a good reliable brand. Obviously whatever inner material they use to maintain the toe shape just isn‚Äôt suitable. I managed to rip it out of one shoe, but the other is stuck fast around the base so my son had to go to school in his trainers. Rubbish."

Amazon were great with refund. Tried another pair as really liked the shoe and though it might have just been a faulty pair of shoes. Unfortunately second pair have exactly the same problem. Put up with problem for as long as possible, as it is so hard to find decent school shoes. We haven't returned them as they had good wear for 3 months (but expect shoes to last a lot longer than that!!) and can't be bothered to return yet another pair.  However, they became too painful to wear so were thrown away. Decided to try Matalan and found a pair straight away, they fit and are much more comfortable than the Geox.

The laces are quite high up too, so that made a borrow instep. They might have been long enough, but he simply could not get his foot into them.

I thought I had finally found a 10 slim since that was in the size drop down menu when I ordered it. NOT SO! My sister says the pant STYLE says slim straight BUT the actual SIZE label on the pant says 10 regular NOT slim. Very disappointed. My nephew will now have to wear this by trying to cinch in all the extra waist with a belt and leaving his shirt untucked to hide it. Not the look I was intending for him and I hate that he feels a bit self conscious about how it looks now too. I am giving it two stars though since the color was a nice, rich black and the quality of the pant is very good.

I bought this for a Christmas party because his size was impossible to find in store, when i received them they were the same thing as i could have found in store. Was not happy but by that time he had to wear them otherwise they would have been returned. I am fine with the main description listing slim straight but when you choose a size it should not list 16 slim because again these are NOT SLIM.

Also this is the only brand I can buy at the beginning of the school year for our super tall skinny kid that lasts the whole school year. They have plenty of well placed fabric so you can let the length down for height growth, and they have the adjustable waists that some of the older kids sizes that other brands don't have.

My 10 year old son wore these for about 1.5 months and then they were torn and had ripped around the toe and the rubber on the heel was peeling off.  He typically goes through shoes quickly (4-6 months) as he is hard on his feet but these were way too fast.  I'm thinking it's because there is no hard rubber around the outside of the shoe just leather and the rubber on the sole sticks out...?  I don't know but it clearly didn't stand a chance.  Will not buy puma again sadly.

NO offense intended, but it seems you can spend between $10 and $60 bucks for dress shoes for this age and frankly, I don't care for 95% of them.Enter this suede oxford for around $50. It has the look of a J. Crew shoe that retails for double this price, comes in colors both conservative and fun, and looks great on your little man's foot.My son said these were comfortable, and I really love how they stand apart from their plastic-y peers in this product segment.I would buy again without hesitation, and probably will as his feet grows and we need another shoe for dressy occasions. (Although I have to say these look just as fantastic with jeans as they do dress pants!)"

With the look of oxfords but no need to double-sock it, since they‚Äôre padded on the heel and tongue. They are also SUPER lightweight! Flexible, too. Great with skinny jeans or straight leg.

The bottom is plastic, which will slid (not grip) and wear down quickly, especially with an active boy.  I knew the price was good, but this is the example of something you will just spend more money replacing over time.  HOWEVER, it you just need it for one day for something like a wedding or a holiday service, they look decent enough for a wearing, but not super comfortable."

1145,"Leo Lam, PhD",3.0,the United States ,"January 2, 2020","Inexpensive, fits fine, but don't last at all","This pair of Deer Stag looks fine when it arrived; a little plasticky in a way, but seems fairly well made, especially considering the extremely low price. I usually wear Florsheims which are close to at least double, if not triple the price. Overall, these shoes serve the purpose of walking shoes, but I had to change out the non-existence insole with one that has arch support. I am wearing these as an adult (wearing size 5, at under 130 lb), though, so keep that in mind.The sad part is that, based on the order date, both shoes' soles have already split at month 4. Mind you, these are not my daily wear (I alternate between three pairs of shoes), and you should see in the photo that the split ran the whole width of the shoe. I have not had this happen with the Florsheims, and again, based on order date, all of my Florsheims lasted about a year. I had to retire those only when I wore through the soles.In short, for the price, these are fine occasional shoes, but not made to last. For about double the price, the Florsheims would last about four times longer and look a lot more expensive."

He normally wears crocs or winter boots, so he complained a little of them being tight in the toe, but I think it's because he's not used to wearing fancy shoes.  He normally wears a 1.5-2 in sneakers, so I order both sizes to see which would fit better.  Neither.  I had to return both and order a 13.5.

I first ordered my son a polo shirt that he loves so much I ordered him another color. Then I ordered this shirt which he also loves. It looks great on him and we love the shade of blue. It‚Äôs a very durable feeling material and has held up perfectly to multiple washings. He loves it so much I‚Äôm going to order the other colors as well. He‚Äôs almost 12 and about 5‚Äô5 but a slim build and the 14/16 is the perfect size for him. Looks great now but still has some room for growth. I took some pictures of him wearing the shirt and the one of him seated definitely shoes it‚Äôs true color better as light blue. The other one is leaning over the car so it‚Äôs a bit twisted but I think gives a pretty good idea of the fit. I‚Äôd say closer to a slim fit but not all that close fitting. Just not as blousy as some button downs can be. Looks great with anything and is easy to dress up or down. He‚Äôs picky about his clothes and their fit but says this is comfortable and looks great.
1212,ChickenFriend,5.0,the United States ,"February 19, 2022",Comfortable,"I got this shirt for my 8-year-old son, and he loves how comfortable it is. He has texture issues when it comes to clothes, like me, so it's wonderful when I find something he loves. It's on the thinner side, so it's best for warmer weather or with another layer.

He's also a teenage boy so they don't always stay white for too long. I try to keep him a nice supply so he isn't rewearing the same one over and over. I say that to explain we have owned a lot of white shirts. This is one of his favorites. He says that it fits well and is very comfortable. The shirt washes well and has held up remarkably well. It fit true to size for him.
1214,JJ,5.0,the United States ,"November 17, 2021",Wrinkle free!,I love this shirt! It is so smooth pressed and comes out of the dryer so nicely. The n√°utica brand does a really good job of making clothes that look pressed. And I hate ironing so this is perfect. It can look casual with the sleeves rolled or formal buttoned up with a tie. The color is perfect! My son loves it.

1229,ReviewToaKill,4.0,the United States ,"October 9, 2020","Great Quality, Price Point Smarts","I had one of those ""Oh, poop"" moments recently, when I realize my son had grown more than expected while quarantining.  He's always been a stringbean kind of kid, to the extent that up until this summer, he's still been wearing some 4T shorts and swim trunks despite being 7 1/2 years old.  That streak came to an end a month ago, when we tried to put on actual clothes.  He spent all summer in elastic-waisted athletic shorts, so we had no idea.  When face-to-face school finally started back up, he had 2 whole pairs of shorts (which I had mistakenly ordered too large last year) that fit.  I've been scrambling since to replace his bottoms.These are very nice pants.  The slim works well with my son's build, who is slim despite the recent growth spurt.  You have the standard red, white, and blue lining of the waistband, and it has the adjustable tab to help with fit.  The outside of the pants are entirely navy.  You wouldn't want to anger the Dress Code Gods.All that said, while I'm grateful to have these, the price point is a bit high for me for a 2nd grader's school uniform.  We're just not that fancy, and it's only a matter of time before he has another crazy growth spurt or decides to wipe his greasy hands on his pants and we're stuck with very expensive grease-stained pants."

1396,S,4.0,the United States ,"January 20, 2012",Good pants. No complaints.,"I bought these for my 8 year old who has, frankly, no butt. Waists have to constrict him for his pants to stay up. We used to use belts, but they were just too tight and he was always coming home with red marks on his sides. We tried suspenders, but that caused potty-time issues at school (he is non-verbal autistic). These pants work really well to solve the problem, and the kid seems content enough. He used to come home everyday asking to change into ""comfy pants"" but now he heads straight for the Wii instead. I feel that says alot. They're not the traditional cotton fabric/feel of regular pants, but not rough on the skin. They're a bit lighter. The bottoms of the legs are oddly narrow, I thought. They narrow as they go down the leg. We're not accustomed to that (but they do fit). They grip the waist just enough without causing discomfort, and I feel that's important for a kid's ability to focus at school.Regarding sizes, ... for my son (having no butt) we found a size 6 to work better than a size 7. Technically, he's a size 7 with regular non-elastic pants. So, go a size lower if you're experiencing a similar issue. We personally bought two of sizes 6 and 7 intending to return what didn't fit. We kept the 7s for next winter, anyway. Good pants. A bit nontraditional, but sometimes that's just what the doctor ordered. Not sure what the other reviewer's issue was with their toddler's pants.

I saved about $5 off the price I would have paid at the uniform store.  Pants have a nice elastic waist band that is small enough for my older son's skinny hips (he's the size of a 3 year old), but gives enough so it doesn't squeeze my younger (almost 3 years old) son's big belly.  Knees are reinforced with a patch type material ironed/glued on the inside.  It comes with about 3 inches of extra material hemmed on the inside in case you have a tall kid, but I have a shorty so I had to hem another 3 inches off the bottom.  Overall, the pants have resisted many paint and marker stains (washes right out with no pretreating).  Son can pull pants up and down with no problem.  Definitely satisfied with my purchase."
1400,mossmouse,4.0,the United States ,"May 26, 2015",Generous fit for Husky Sizes,"I ordered these for my hard to fit husky son, mainly because of the elastic waist. I ordered the 14H and found that they are a bit big in the rise like other reviewers have said, these are cut very square, like scrub pants. I then ordered the 12H and they also fit a little odd, and were too small when he sat down. The odd fit is the only reason I did not give these 5 stars, because otherwise they are just what we needed! The fabric is good, reinforced knees are always a must, full elastic waist is hard to find even in husky sizes and for the price I don't think you can go wrong. If my son wears a sweater vest these pants look great, they just wouldn't look right with a tucked-in dress shirt alone (no belt loops either)."

Glue showing all over the sneaker and when you walk in them there is a horrible squeaking noise.  Kept the sneakers thinking once they were broken in it would be better but unfortunately it was not.
1418,DaveV,1.0,the United States ,"January 3, 2014",Blow out after 3 months,My eight year old had these come apart after only three months.  I always buy a name brand with stitched on soles and usually have good luck.  These just did not hold up.  Will not purchase again.

1421,deng,2.0,the United States ,"August 23, 2014",The shows is nice but extremely narrow,"The shows is nice but extremely narrow! my daughter is tiny and has skinny feet. I ordered size 12 . the length is fine but it is just too narrow that her feet hurt when she used it on first day of school.  So last august 19 i ordered again and this time i ordered WIDE. It arrived today but although the box stated WIDE, the shoes is exactly as narrow as the M that i bought."
1422,Ray Medhus,2.0,the United States ,"March 25, 2015",Not up to par for a K-Swiss product,"the overall quality of the shoe does not match the price of the shoe in that the wrap around side of the sole has come away from the toe of the shoe in less than 1-weeks time. I have long thought of K-Swiss products as high quality, but this pair of shoes does not meet that standard."
1423,VGLeBlanc,2.0,the United States ,"December 18, 2014",Not as durable as I remember,I bought these for my six year olds school shoes because kswiss were always my go to shoes.  I think my son is just as rough on his shoes as any other kid and the rubber soles are separating and the laces have frayed pretty badly.  I don't think I'll buy these again.
1424,C. Bell,2.0,the United States ,"March 25, 2013",what is it?,"My young son keeps complaining of something pricking his pinky toe! I've looked, but I don't see anything at all. However, my niece who is older complains of the same thing. I would guess it was a manufacturing problem, only what are the chances that their shoes came out the same batch?!"
1425,Dorie M,2.0,the United States ,"February 4, 2013",Is lacking in some areas,"This shoe is narrow across the toes, and definitely needs a better arch support. I'm truly disappointed with this shoe, but wanted an all white leather tennis shoe."
1426,Richard Stagliano,2.0,the United States ,"June 18, 2014",No support,"I'm not satisfied with this K-Swiss tennis shoe for the price.  It has little support, thinner sole than pictured, and will not hold up in extensive play."

1431,A Herrera,3.0,the United States ,"March 5, 2013",hand-crafted?,"I really liked this shoes because of the looks and comfort that the shoes have given to my daughter but for this review, I'd have to say that they're just ok. This was my daughter's favorite school shoes and she comfortably worn a size 12.5 for more than a year until recently when she complained that her feet were hurting. Based from her other current sports shoes, I purchased a kids size 2.5 for her. I quickly noticed that the pair we received had slightly different lengths. My observation was confirmed when I saw that the right shoe insert was buckling up with the glue marks at the bottom of the insert showing, while the left one lay flat. I asked my daughter if she notices if one of them is smaller and she said no and she's comfortable with them. I'm not sure if she was really comfortable on them and she does not notice the size difference, or that she's just more comfortable with the new pair compared against the older one. I didn't return the item and she has continued to use the new shoes for about a week now."
1432,Lesley,3.0,the United States ,"April 16, 2016",These K-Swiss run small and narrow.,"I'm kind-of old school so I was really drawn to the K-Swiss Classics for my son when looking for a good black tennis shoe for his school uniform.  He has other K-Swiss and even though his foot is kind-of wide, I have never had any problems with regular width K-Swiss, Sketchers or Nike...until I bought these.  They were totally unlike the other K-Swiss we have had for him.  They ran very small and narrow.  He could not fit his foot in them comfortably for even 10 minutes.  We had to return them ASAP.It is a shame too, because they were cute.  But I must say that even the quality was off a little.  Not the best of the K-Swiss that I have seen.  Disappointed."
1433,Neynah Jaye,3.0,the United States ,"September 7, 2015",for one purpose and not for lasting purpose,they go with almost anything you wear but in that case they didn't last as long ( as we all know) classic k-swiss just come undone in stitching after a couple weeks..  I just wanted to have white shoes for an occasion and just today they will be tossed out--glad I waited for the price to drop.. (knowing in advance from prior purchases) they would not last--
1434,Britt C.,3.0,the United States ,"July 12, 2015",I love the look and the fit is perfect,"These shoes were delivered on July 7th, 2015 so they are shy of a week old. I love the look and the fit is perfect. I got a 4.5W, ideally I'm a 5.5 boys.  Unfortunately, the line design on the shoe has fallen apart. It was not sewed in, just glued on. That is the black stuff that looks like dirt. Love the shoe. Hopefully it stay intact."
1435,annette rivera,3.0,the United States ,"August 23, 2013",Nice Sneaker,"Good sneaker, comfortable.  Material good quality.  I received the black sneaker and I noticed that on the stripe part of the sneaker, the glue was exposed and I had to clean it to make the sneaker presentable.  I wore the sneaker today and it function well.  I also got the white pair.  The white pair was made perfectly fine, no glue stuff sticking out.  I would buy this sneaker again."
1436,Rachel Flannigan,3.0,the United States ,"December 3, 2014",Like the shoe but not how fast it looks worn out!,"My little girl likes the shoe and it fits nicely, however, these shoes looked worn out fast!!!  The very top looks very worn and we have had plenty of white keds that do not look nearly has worn out so early on.  That is my only complaint about the shoe...cute shoe, nice fit, but looks like an old shoe fast!"
1437,BAGS,3.0,the United States ,"February 14, 2013",It's ok,"Bought these for a white school uniform shoe. It is narrow at the ball of the foot, completely straight where your foot would be widest. Might want to consider a wide width or one size larger, even if you don't normally need wide. Seems to hold up well to wear. Leather in good condition."
1438,Kira7,3.0,the United States ,"November 19, 2014",a bit big on me,"Can't wear them for any length of time because they run big and slip up and down on my ankles and cause blisters. They also make me trip with my foot drop because they are ill-fitting. But if they DO fit you well, they ARE nice shoes. Very high quality"

1441,JKBlockette,4.0,the United States ,"July 21, 2015",good for cheerleading,"We bought these shoes for our 7 year old daughter for her cheerleading competitions. She does not complain about them hurting her feet, however, she does have narrow feet. She doesn't wear them for extended periods of time, but it able to cheer and dance in them without any problems or complaints. When she outgrows these, we will probably buy another pair if she is still cheering at this level."
1442,Julie,4.0,the United States ,"April 27, 2014","Nice fit, laces may not hold up",Both our sons have worn this shoe in various sizes. We like black leather because it holds up better than any other material we've tried. It's also a comfortable shoe. One of our sons is hard on laces and yanked them so hard whenever he tied his shoes that he pulled the metal rings out of the shoe. Our other son is a little more careful with things and never had that problem.
1443,Smittie,4.0,the United States ,"September 28, 2012",Can't go wrong!,"Recently bought these for my 8 yr old who plays football at recess everyday - last school year we went through about 5-6 pair of tennis shoes; I needed sturdy, but stylish, affordable but not cheap...and they had to be all white for his uniform. These K-Swiss are all that. The styling and stitching of the toe make them perfect for a pounding. ...and my boy says they're really comfortable. Price is decent too!  #winning"
1444,Dawnie,4.0,the United States ,"December 14, 2015",Comfy Shoes,"Purchased for my very active son for school. The shoes is soft and he prefers to keep them on all day and has asked to wear them to church too! Despite the attractive look of the shoe and they have held up to athletics and football, I am not sure if they will last the entire school year"

I don't know if I should keep them till he grows into them, sinceI got them for a good price or should I return them and get a smaller pair."
1446,A S,4.0,the United States ,"November 11, 2014",Not as comfortable as New Balance,"But its a nice leather shoe, a bit heavy.  Sole is moderately flexible. VERY good for the winter. Over all Better than most I have tried, alas New Balance and Nike get 5 star so this gets a 4 :)Get it you cannot go too wrong its a nice shoe, I would give it 4.5 stars but no option for that."
1447,Wolfi1313,4.0,the United States ,"July 9, 2014",Nice shoe,"Bought this for my daughter to go with more outfits than her other flashy brightly colored shoes would go with.  At first she didn't like them, then I offered to modify them with bright shoe laces (a different color in each shoe) and now she likes to wear them without having to be told."
1448,HeckIT,4.0,the United States ,"September 5, 2015",Classic Shoes,My son has to wear only white gym shoes for gym. Hard to find kids shoes in white only. This classic pair was perfect and won't get worn out as quickly because he only goes to gym twice a week.

Recommend kneeding or working that area prior to wearing all day.Other than that, nice product."
1450,Sfcitymom,4.0,the United States ,"July 27, 2014",Perfect for the school uniform,It is very hard to find all white K-Swiss in the shoe departments at most stores.  My daughter loves the all white and they are perfect for the requirement all white shoes.  They are made well and are comfortable for my daughter.
1451,docmom,5.0,the United States ,"May 20, 2012",Solid and Kid-Proof,"Thank you K-Swiss for making this shoe for decades.  I remember wanting a pair in the 1970's and now my kids are wearing them.  My children's school has a dress code with all white tennis shoes, which are hard to find.  In addition, I have tried to buy cheaper shoes and have ended up replacing them every 1-2 weeks - I'm not sure how my kids destroy them but it's downright frightening to my wallet.  So I invested in the K-Swiss and have not been sorry.  I literally bought 7 pairs of other shoes between September and December, then bought the K-Swiss and they lasted for over a year until my daughter grew out of them.  I do recommend printing out the size chart and making sure you get the right size."
1452,S. mclain,5.0,the United States ,"September 8, 2015",... and wants his THIRD pair so they must be comfortable! They are very durable,"These were purchased for my then 10 year old son who loves them and wants his THIRD pair so they must be comfortable!  They are very durable, much more so than other similarly priced brands.  His first pair was worn by a friend first so withstood the wear and tear of 2 rough and tumble boys.  His second still looks great and he is about to outgrow them.  He had a few pairs of a competing brand (two words, first word starts with N) that wore out so fast he went through three pairs of the same size."
1453,C. Chandler,5.0,the United States ,"November 8, 2014",SHOE,"These are very nice quality shoes, we have only used them for 'nice'.... so he hasnt worn them as a daily shoe!  or played outside for hours on end either....  maybe outside for a birthday party....  they are 7 months old and still look new!  of course they have had some CLEANINGS along the way!  Tho I put somewhat large.... that is only in comparison to the SKETCHERS that are the same size he wears.  they are NOT bigger like he cant wear them...  they are just almost a half size bigger at the toes!"

1455,Taneicha L,5.0,the United States ,"October 25, 2015",Fine Quality,I am not a fan of Kswiss but these are really great. My 7 year old wears a size 11 but bought these in size 12.5. His feet are really small so I wondered if these would be swimmingly big. They fit well with the right amount of room for him to grow in. He says it is really comfortable and hates wearing any other shoes to school.It has a little weight and feels sturdy. I also do not need to polish it often.
1456,David leija,5.0,the United States ,"December 7, 2013",k swiss review-,"My son is wears these to private school and is extremely tough on his shoes. they look great with his uniform and have held up very very well. I decided to buy these after he tore up his newbalance in only 2 months. these shoes not only look good, they have taken a beating and still look new. very very happpy with this purchase. I feel we will be making this our go to shoe brand for him. my son's only complaint is that the grip on the bottom of the shoe is not very good, but aside from that the shoe is awesome"
1457,S. Robinson,5.0,the United States ,"May 28, 2015",Built to last,We purchase at least two pair each school year as a part of the school uniform. We love k-Swiss and so does our son. The fit was comfortable and they are built for a rugged 8 year old boy. The only bad thing is the polish tends to fade and the shoe color is completely gone. We thought about shoe polish but with 8 more days of school we will postpone that idea for next school year. 8 years old 80 pounds 51 inches tall purchased size 2.
1458,Mommyof3,5.0,the United States ,"January 14, 2013",Always loved the KSwiss Classic,"I needed a pair of nice all white shoes for my daughters cheer competition which was really hard to find. Then a light came on ding ding ding ""MY: favorite shoe (lol) I wore these throughout my whole entire high school year and they are just as white and stylish today, as they were back then, My husband even told my daughter, those were your moms favorite shoes. But they are so clean and crispy white you can't go wrong. This shoe can be worn with almost anything and look good, And for the price of $28 was even better!!"
1459,Amazon Customer,5.0,the United States ,"October 15, 2012",Perfect shoe find.,"My son needed a pair of white tennis shoes for his casual choir outfit. After looking in every store around and online I was so happy to find these. I hated the idea of spending money on a pair of ugly solid white shoes that he wouldn't wear outside of choir and these are perfect. They are exactly what we were looking for and they are so good looking. He's completely happy with them, they fit well and they don't look like shoes his grandpa would wear. Love K-Swiss!"
1460,Dr. Lynn,5.0,the United States ,"May 3, 2015",Works for us!,"You really can't go wrong with a K-Swiss Classic. My only concern was if this was an authentic product and it is! If you need sizing, go directly to the K-Swiss website and print out there sizing form to ensure you're getting the correct length and width for your child. I also appreciate that this shoe is less expensive than going to the K-Swiss site to purchase. Same quality but better value works for me."

It was also a bit small, since we ordered a half size up and it was still a bit tight on his foot (and challenging to get on). That said, this shoe looked great and wore well with his suit. It looks to be of decent quality, though time and wear will tell me more."

He has officially out grown them and they still look brand new. He plays soccer, runs in mid, slides around on the floor and all sorts of crazy things that have torn up all his previous shoes. I‚Äôm VERY impressed with how well they have held up. So much so I‚Äôve ordered him a second pair."
1482,Forest,5.0,the United States ,"January 24, 2019",Great shoes!,"These shoes are really holding up well. My son has to wear them once a week for a full day at school. Last year, we selected a slightly less expensive pair, and they looked pretty bad after only a couple of weeks. He can be rough on shoes - we get keen for regular wear. This year, we got these for school, basically going for the brand name despite the iffy reviews (the previous shoes had an unknown brand and great reviews) and we've been very happy with them. He's been wearing them one day a week for about 6 months and they only show light wear. I just checked the edges, and I don't see any sign of the leather separating from the bottoms like in some of the reviews. I'm writing this review while ordering a new pair the next size up."

This shoe is very comfortable and durable.  I have bought this style for my son for his school uniform for the past 4 years.  The front does not wear out easily, though their school playground was concrete therefore other shoes used to wear out in the front.  He would wear this shoe through out the year if not for the growth sprouts.  I highly recommend this brand of Florsheim shoes."

After 10 min he announced that they were comfy and he liked them. So it took just 10 min. for the shoes to wear in. Yay! I also should mention that we ordered the wide width and they fit great. They will be his First Communion shoes so I want him to like them and be comfy, thinking about his First Communion, not his shoes bugging him on his special day."
1485,Angela Moorman,5.0,the United States ,"March 11, 2014",A Great Bargain,"As my son's feet continue to grow, I was looking for a nice, leather dress shoe for several upcoming events. He usually wears a youth size 7 (lace-ups).  I decided to take a chance and order this pair.  Upon arrival, my son tried the shoes on with his dress socks. His heel slipped.  They were slightly too big. However I don't think he could wear a smaller size and his feet are constantly growing.  Our solution - he wears them with his black Nike sports socks, which are thicker.  He said it works and also commented that these shoes are lightweight and very comfortable.  In my opinion, they are the best bargain you will find in a quality leather slip-on."
1486,linda M Stuart,5.0,the United States ,"April 20, 2017",One tough shoe.,"These shoes are amazing.  While I have just purchased this new pair, my grandson (age 8) had the same shoe last year in a smaller size.  It wore like iron.  He went to school, played on a playground, came home & climbed trees and rode his bike with them on.  Needless to say they took a beating, but still looked great.

Hence, the passing three stars! Regrettably, we did everything the instructions said on measuring my son's feet and vis-a-via the sizes online. Our first time buying it online. We felt there was something wrong but proceeded to follow the online instructions anyway. We were mistaken. It was delivered and they were several ages too big! We should've trusted our gut! Oh well lesson learned. Hopefully my son's growth spurts triples in the next months/years so he can enjoy the shoe he loves! Yes there were options to return but there's a reason we bought it online - no time. Anyway, I'm sure my son would rather see another happy child who will enjoy these shoes.
