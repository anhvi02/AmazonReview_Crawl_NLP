0,Shopping Guy,1,the United States ,21-Nov-19,The Versa 2 is well known to stop working and Fitbit won't refund your money when it does.,"Do not buy the Versa 2!  This device is unreliable, many user community reports confirm this and Fitbit will not back up their product warranty to refund your money when it doesn’t work.Details:I bought this Fitbit Versa 2 instead of the iWatch mainly because it’s supposed to track sleep and that feature isn’t available on iWatch yet and also because Versa 2 is less expensive, but paying less doesn’t matter if it doesn’t work.  Did it work?  Sort of - but only for a while.  It sort of tracked sleep sometimes for a few weeks, but not always.  Some nights it didn’t track at all and if you wake up for more than 20 minutes or so and then get back to sleep it stops tracking your sleep altogether.  Sleep analytics without the premium features were interesting when they worked because theres some nice graphs showing how much time is spent in the different sleep phases.  However, when I upgraded to the premium sleep features that you have to pay for the interesting data charts disappeared and the sleep features were actually worse.  I also noticed that the Versa 2 double or triple counted my steps and I was getting to 10,000 steps on days I spent mostly at a desk.  I checked the internet for Versa 2 user reports and found out that many users have the problem where the Versa 2 either over reports or under reports steps - which is the main feature of this watch.  Then, the Versa 2  stopped tracking sleep all together - nothing.  A few days later it also completely stopped synchronizing with the iphone app.  I spent a couple of hours going through all the online community information to determine what to do.Many people in the Versa 2 user community had similar problems where their Versa 2 stopped working, stopped tracking sleep and/or stopped synching with the app.  There are so many user reported problems that there are several professional product review sites that give a multi-step, multi-layer process for “fixing your Fitbit Versa when it stops working”.  I tried the Versa 2 restart steps that the professional sites recommend trying first and that did nothing.  Then I did what the professional sites say to do next if restart didn’t work - full Versa 2 factory reset.  The Versa 2 data and app purchases are not backed up on the Fitbit cloud so the restart caused the Versa 2 to lose all data on the device and lose the app purchases I had made.I would be forced to go through the hassle and expense of repurchasing and reconfiguring the apps, and then when the Versa freezes up again I would have to go through the process again.At this point I decided to return the product for a refund because I don’t have time to deal with unreliable electronics that don’t work, lose my data, lose my purchases and take hours to simply keep running.  I tried returning on Amazon but the Amazon site sent me to the Fitbit customer service website because I was outside the 30 day Amazon return window.  When I called Fitbit they gave me a big, long runaround and wanted me to spend more time fussing with them to troubleshoot their Versa 2 device.  They were able to observer their cloud logs for the device and they could see that it stopped working properly and that I had to resynchronize it, but that wasn’t enough and they wanted me to spend time over the phone troubleshooting why the device wasn’t working.  I said they have clear evidence in their own logs the device doesn’t work properly, there are a ton of user problems reported on the internet, and I simply want to return it under their 1 year return policy.Fitbit refused to honor their warranty and give me a return slip.  I asked to escalate and they said the would put me in the return escalation queue for an email response to my request, and apparently there are many people in front of me in that queue because they said it would be tomorrow or next week before they would send me an email, and it was unlikely the email would allow me to return.So now I’m stuck with a pretty expensive piece of electronic junk.  I’m done with Fitbit and the Versa 2.  I plan to wait until iWatch has sleep mode because iWatch is reliable and it does everything else the Versa 2 does plus more.  If you want an exercise watch that is less than the iWatch, go with one of the others but not the Versa 2."
1,Michelle,1,the United States ,15-Mar-20,"Huge waste of money, not really useful for much","Cons: So Alexa is what they advertise with for this model. She is pretty much useless. I wasn't able to find anything she can do except saying ""I didn't get that"", ""I don't know this "", ""Thete is no news on this"" or the weather. Although she isn't always able to show a forecast either. She varies between Fahrenheit and Celsius and even though my phone (which is synchronized to her via the app) I has a turned on GPS she stopped using the right place for forecasts after a couple of days. Then she would automatically use a village that is about 4 miles from where I grew up in Germany (never went there since I have a phone) even though I bought the watch in the US and it has never been in Germany with me.  Pretty ridiculous and super annoying.The sleep tracker sometimes doesn't track when you sleep or it thinks you sleep when you're lying down to watch a show or snooze/doze in the morning when you sleep in. Luckily, you can manually delete this though.When you work out it will often think it is Aerobics (happened when I was dancing in a bar as well as for martial arts). If it doesn't realize you're doing a workout it counts the active minutes (realizes that by heart beat) but when you add a workout for that time the active minutes get deleted and you might end up with 0 active minutes for that day. When you add a workout manually you have to add the calories manually which I feel is kinda not the point.The food tracking or rather the statement of calories you have left doesn't make much sense either, at least the calories in and out part which is why I haven't really been using it since it is just weird.I can't synchronize it in a way that I could use timers etc. on the watch.Not really good designs available for free but the orginal fitbit one is, so you could go with that. They let you try the ones you need to buy for a day though.I bought a pack of designs for $10 but afterwards they didn't show anywhere in the spot where you chose your design. I just got shown the one I had tried because that was already saved with my favorites. The other24 don't show and I don't know where to find them to use them. Wasted money again.Pros: Pretty color and watch seems high quality. Not a plastic but actual glass display. The showing of the sleep score and oxygen concentration is a great feature, especially for the sleep phases and the possible comparisons to your usual length of each phase and the average for your age and gender.The floor and step counter mostly works well too and I like that it shows how far you've walked with that and your burned calories and the heart beat plus your average resting heart beat.All in all: it has many great features but next time I would get the version without Alexa and always try to get it discounted because like this it's not really worth the money.EDIT:I edited my rating to 1 star because it keeps not synchronizing properly even though ""All-Day-Synch"" is turned on. Wore it for a run for the first time and even though GPS to track the trail on a map is activated there is no chance to see a map or pace. All it shows is heart rate and the way of energy use (cardio, fat burn, peak), duration, calories and steps. I was really looking foward to seeing a map with pace and distance but nope.Also, I found out I can't connect it to my whatsapp to see my messages on the watch.Guess an apple watch would have been a better choice. This device is not worth more than maybe 50-70 bucks. So I can not, in any case recommend it. I'm sorry.Edit after 4 months: Broken, watch display doesn't light up anymore, only the other tabs when you swipe - not the watch face"
2,Digitaldoodlebug,1,the United States ,18-Sep-19,My first smart watch which is a mixed bag,"Update 3-2-21The screen wouldn't accept touches around the top, or would do it intermittently. A few days later and now the touch screen won't work at all. So 1.5 years in and my $200 ""smart"" watch is only a watch with more on the display. I'll try another brand next time.------------------------------This is my first smart watch ever. I never preorder but decided to after reading a cnet article on versa2 and many articles that compared smart watches. The watch I'm sure is fine but the app is terrible. It wouldn't connect to let me create an account and kept saying the network was down. There is no documentation with the watch other than ""download the app"" and ""how to change bands"". I turned it on by holding down the one button but all it did was flash through languages saying to use the app. Which means it's completely worthless if the app doesn't work.-----The Bad----As I was trying to set it up I was ready to give it 1 star and wondering if I would have to return it as a paper weight. Once it finally let me join and login each page was terribly slow to load. It literally took 2 HOURS to make an account, update versa2, get it synced to my phone, and a few other basic things.Does it track steps or movement? Given that it's on your arm logic says the only way for it to track steps is based on moving your arm. However one moves their arm for many reasons. Getting ready in the morning and only walking through 2 rooms to do so it already had me at 400 steps for the day. Brushing my hair, pressing the tv remote, or other such tasks is not steps. It also auto logged me using the riding lawn mower as 30 minutes of bike riding. Pretty sure it doesn't burn the same calories so I'll be looking to see if the auto feature can be turned off. It lacks skating as an exercise so I'll have to choose something close.-----The Good----Once it finally got going it seems to be a nice piece of tech. Like a little phone on your arm but less features. It has tons of clock faces which each have a small cost, but will let you trial it.Still testing out the battery life. I am not using the always on and it used maybe 10% in 15 hours so it's looking good. I did not want a watch that had to be charged every day. It has a little charger it easily snaps into but the cord is very short and barely reaches my dresser.The heart rate monitor keeps up and appears to work well.It's also waterproof which is one reason I bought it.Played iheartradio on my phone with bluetooth headphones and the watch did control the volume.The sleep tracker appears to work as intended. There is no saying how accurate it is without a sleep study but it had me awake for 1 hour out of 8. It did take a while for me to fall asleep and I wake up many times during the night.I didn't see the point of a calorie tracker because I thought it had to all be entered manually and was just a digital notebook. However it has a barcode scanner so I was able to easily scan almost all of my meals for the day. Then it imported them to show an overview of calories and % of carbs, fat, protein.Did a manual start for the eliptical so that was recorded right.-----Other Thoughts----This is only day 3 with it and I'll update this as needed.In the food logger app you can click each item to see expanded nutrition. It would be great if we could see that totaled for the day instead of only calories. Such as total carbs, protein, potassium, sodium, sugar, ect.You can disable each ""auto exercise"" type so it doesn't log mowing for example. You can also change the minutes required before it logs them with a min of 10 minutes.It tracked a step for stepping into the tub so I was impressed with that. Then I went down my 5 porch steps and it didn't track it."
3,Jeffrey and Sandra,1,the United States ,18-Sep-19,Can’t use it in the pool fried  already after 1 day. Pink band was bought separately,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Another update before I return my watch for the second time: it’s 5:36am and my watch says that I slept 8 hours. I’ll upload the imagine. I went to bed at 11:15 and woke up at 5 am. I can’t believe how off the sleeping app is today.An update: my Sister got a new Fitbit versa for me again and I wore both Apple Watch and Fitbit Watch. The step count was very different. Almost 3 thousand more steps with the Fitbit. It counted extra 800 steps while I was in the resting position. Ones again I contacted the Fitbit asking them why this has happened, they told me Apple and other devices  count steps differently. 2856 step difference is huge though.My wife just got her Fitbit Versa 2 yesterday and went swimming with it as it today. The watch initially worked for a few minutes while using the swimming app. After 20 minutes she came out and the watch was totally off. We tried to charge it everything but it seams that it got water fried. It’s supposed to be water resistant up to 50 meters!  The pink band was bought separately. Original was purple. Had exactly same problem with last generation Versa. And from googling it seams that we are not alone with this problem. I returned my watch and asked Fitbit if they would give a discount if I buy a new watch they said they will not. Well I guess I’ll just save up extra and get an Apple Watch. Will definitely send all the videos I had made to the bloggers so others won’t make the same mistake."
4,Blackwood789,1,the United States ,25-Jun-20,Broke after 5 months,"We have had numerous issues with Fitbit and their tracking devices. I have had my Versa 2 for less than 5 months and the screen randomly popped off. It hasn't been dropped and you can clearly see that the screen in still in good condition. Fitbit support said it was normal wear and the policy does not include replacement for it. All I was offered was 25% off a new device and when I said that wasn't enough, the agent said I should end the chat. My husband and I will no longer be buying or supporting anything from Fitbit. Do yourself a favor and get yourself a real smart watch.Andres: Hi  Erin, My name is  Andres.  How can I help you?Me:Hi Andres. My fitbit versa 2 screen popped out of the watch and it won't stay back in.Andres:I'd be glad to assist you with regard to your Fitbit Versa 2 that the screen popped out of the watch.Andres:May I know the email address associated with your Fitbit account?Me:Andres:Thank you.Andres:I confirmed your Versa 2 last synced on June 24, 2020 with 54% battery using your iOS device.Andres:Our warranty policy does not include replacement for damage due to normal wear.Andres:Accidental or physical damage is not covered by our standard warranty.Andres:By the way, after our chat you will receive a brief survey.

5,Jackson Tech,1,the United States ,11-Feb-20,"Poor Tracking, Hidden Expenses and Ads.  Yuck.","When unboxing and pairing the fitbit and pairing to the phone, I was asked for a credit card to pay an extra $9.99/mo.  At first, it wasn't clear what that was for.  This watch was was already expensive, why is the phone app not included in the purchase price?  I initially declined the extra fees.When using the app to view reports from the watch, nearly every page displays an ad demanding you to pay $9.99 to access the full features of that page within the app.  I purchased this specifically for sleep tracking.  The sleep tracking page in the app conceals much of the data they're collecting on you without paying a monthly fee.  And if you don't want to pay the fee, prepare to be nagged about it constantly while using the app.  I had to give in and pay the hidden tax to access the features I bought the watch for.  Amazon should go ahead and list the purchase price as $250+$9.99/moEven though I'm already paying $9.99/mo, fitbit.com displays irritating pop-up banner ads if you try to view your reports there.  Great.  I love paying to see ads.One of the selling features of this watch is a customizable watch face.  Fitbit helpfully doesn't provide these for you.  They allow ""the community"" to make all the watch faces.  99% of them are awful, and were assembled by somebody with no visual design skills as a hobby project.  To find a stylish watch face, that doesn't look silly or ugly, requires scrolling through pages and pages of ""Baby's first watch-face"" style projects.After a lot of work, I found a few watch faces I liked. I only had to pay $3-5 to download them.  That's $3-5 EACH.Now about the poor sleep tracking.  It works great.  As long as I strap the watch to my wrist much tighter than is comfortable.  As long as the watch band is digging into your skin, and the watch cannot move at all on your wrist, the sleep tracking features are pretty slick.  I wake up with my wrist hurting, but I can ask the app how my sleep was.  If I wear the watch normally, it's possible for the sensor on the watch to lose contact with my skin for some periods of the night.  Then the app report says it's not able to provide good information on that night's sleep, and to wear the watch tighter.  And also, please pay an extra $9.99/mo while you're at it.If I want to check the time, on my watch, I have to press the button first.  The raise to wake feature usually doesn't work.  Except when it's not supposed to.  There is a feature to leave the watch screen on 24/7, but it drains the little battery rather quickly, and it doesn't even show your preferred watch face!  Want to see the watch face you selected?  Go ahead and press the button.As soon as I can replace this device with a better sleep tracker, I'm going to give it as a gift to somebody I don't like very much."
6,Grey,1,the United States ,15-Nov-22,Beware!,I know this will probably get lost in the reviews but just know that the Versa 2 is great for the first few months but then it will start having issues. I bought one for both my husband and myself and they have been nothing but problems. With mine the face just randomly popped off. I called Fitbit customer service and they replaced it but the replacement Versa was undoubtedly refurbished because the battery was worn down to where I had to charge it sometimes twice a day whereas the other one would last up to six days. I again called customer service and they said they wouldn't do anything about it even though it was still in warranty.As for my husband's Versa 2 his sensor stopped working to where it no longer reads his heart rate or zone minutes. His also started having battery draining issues despite going through all the troubleshooting steps.We had thought about upgrading to the newer Fitbit models but at this point I think we're done with Fitbit and will just look for another brand entirely that doesn't have all of these issues and honors its warranty.
7,Nhi Vo,1,the United States ,9-Dec-20,Do not buy this unless you only want to own it for a year,"I got this Fitbit Versa 2 last year as a gift from my family when it came out. I was really excited to use it because I work the night shift as a nurse. I was looking forward to using the timer function to set timers so I can return to the patients' rooms before the IV pumps go off and wake my patients up. I had an Android phone at the time and the smartwatch worked synched really well with it. My problem occurred when 2 weeks ago, my Fitbit started flashing that it was low battery even though I made sure it was fully charged before I left for work. I didn't think much of it and I figured that it will charge once I plug it in. However, the watch did not turn on. I thought it was my charging cable so I ordered new ones and even switched out the wall outlet adapter. Still, it didn't turn on. I tried to press the side button but only the indicator of low battery flashed on. Since it seemed like a manufacturer defect, I called Fitbit customer service to resolve the issues. The representative on the phone was not helpful. She told me to clean the back of the watch, which is already clean and has no dust trapped in it. I followed all her suggestions, including switching out the cables and plugs, all things I had attempted. She then proceeded to tell me it could be my outlet that's the problem, however, that logic doesn't make sense because other electrical products have no problem being charged using the same outlet. I asked if I could send the smartwatch back to the company so it could be checked. She did not respond and proceed to say that I will get an email regarding the warranty, but I questioned if I would be covered considering the product died a month after the warranty. She didn't answer me. Instead, she stated that my case had to be reviewed first. Later, I just received an email stating that my watch is no longer under warranty but they will offer a 35% coupon off any of the products. I do not want another product. I just want the one I had fixed. I understand if I accidentally dropped it and broke it and it's not under warranty anymore. But this product was defective! I only use it mostly for work and I remove it before I shower. So I don't understand how a $200 product can only last a year. I recommend you look elsewhere if you want a product that actually stands the test of time. I don't normally write reviews but I want to save you the money so here it is."
8,A. Mortenson,1,the United States ,13-Jul-21,A waste of $150…it lasted 13 months,"I got this as a gift in January 2020…AGAINST my daughter’s recommendation because she had two that stopped working even before the warranty expired.  I should have listened.The design is good, the screen large and easily readable (when it worked), nicely customizable, the band is comfortable, and I can wear the watch to swim/shower etc.  the battery lasts about a week, which is impressive.  Charging is quick, it takes less than an hour for a full charge.While it was under warranty it would occasionally just not record sleep, steps etc.  and the watch face would disappear.  I’d reset it, change the clock face and it would work again for a while.  It also only occasionally showed me the notifications it was set to show me.  I set it not to remind me to move, but it still did.  I set the app to use cellular data so I could log food while not on my own WiFi , but it never wouldWithin a month of the expiration of the warranty the watch stopped recording anything and the touch screen was unresponsive.  I reset it by pushing and holding the button.  That didn’t work and put the watch into a state of confusion as it just kept cycling through the startup process.  I read the Fitbit Versa 2 forums and found out that MANY Versa 2 owners had the exact same issues and a Versa 2  that is unresponsive needs to be replaced.  I called customer service who directed me to do everything I’d already done.  That worked somewhat…I got a clock face and it did record my steps, sleep and heart rate again…but I couldn’t scroll through the apps and the touchscreen was unresponsive.  The customer service rep advised me it needed replacing and offered me 25% off a new Fitbit…so my $150 watch lasted exactly 13 months.Today it is apparently logging my steps, but the face of the watch is completely blank.  I can track my steps on the app only.This is my fourth Fitbit, I started with the Zip, that was simple and good. Then I moved on to a Flex, then a Charge….this Versa 2 is my last Fitbit though…it’s too expensive a watch to last just 13 months before major problems, and as of today it’s going in the trash.  I strongly recommend you do not buy a Fitbit."
9,Krista Katchen,1,the United States ,17-Aug-22,Regretting my purchase,I really wanted this to work and I really wanted to like this but I just really regret buying it now. I don’t think the calorie and step counter is accurate. There’s a few times I’ve left the watch on a table for 2 days and I pick it up and it says I’ve walked 600 steps and already burned calories. On top of that I’ve developed really bad skin conditions from the watch. I don’t wear it in any type of water but I’ve seen when I wear it tight this happens (you have to have it tight or else it won’t pick up your heartbeat and track things). Now I’m stuck taking it off until my skin heals and honestly it’s just not worth it anymore. I guess I’ll get an Apple Watch. I really didn’t want to do that but I’m tired of being in pain. You can see in the picture I’m now breaking out in hives.  (Below was my initial review after I purchased the watch).Love this watch! Wanted something just for health purposes so I turned off the texts and calls aspect of the watch. The only thing I would say is I wish I had gotten the water proof ones for when I’m washing dishes or my face (it’s left something like a burn mark before) and I also don’t think it tracks calories accurately every time. But it’s a good cheap version of an Apple Watch
10,George,2,the United States ,8-Nov-19,"Wanted to like it, terrible software is a deal breaker","The battery life is excellent. Best in class in fact. The hardware is nice, stylish, has a good touch screen, and the sensors all seem accurate.The software is horrible and this is a deal breaker. Starting with the watch UI:- when an activity is being auto tracked there's no indication of this on the watch so you won't know until after the activity is done if it managed to track it or not. Also you can't modify a previously tracked activity. You can only delete it and manually re-add all the details. (duration, distance, etc. Ugh)- the only thing you can do with the side button is Alexa or fitbit payment. Nothing else is programmable. Would have loved to use it for something else like quickly turning on do not disturb or something.- despite there being a microphone on the watch, no voice memos or voice recording support.- when doing workouts using the fitbit coach app - fitbit's own app - it doesn't show up on the watch. There's no integration. If they can't even integrate their own apps it's hard to believe anyone else will make apps for this.- syncing the watch on your phone requires location services to be on on your phone (Android). I know it's a new android flaw but they (fitbit) could have said this up front. If I'm not going for a run with GPS or using a map it doesnt make sense to have my location being shared with fitbit and Google.- the fitbit app is just full of ads to upgrade and buy other fitbit things. Core content is lacking. It's also a navigation nightmare. Nothing is in an intuitive place.- despite this being a device that contains your personal health information, you cannot protect your fitbit account with multifactor authentication.- you can't manually track basic things like a walk/hike from the watch. You have rely on auto tracking - which you don't know is working until your done and you sync with your phone. While you can manually start tracking more diverse activities from the app, if you start it from the app there's no visual feedback on the watch. So start a walk on the app and you can't check your watch for duration and distance. You have to pull out your phone. Like what...- you can only sync music using wifi. Not Bluetooth. I could also never get Spotify sync to work for some reason. And despite pandora being free to use on your phone to use it with the watch you have to buy pandora premium.- installing a new watch face is a process. The fitbit made ones arent great and there aren't many of them. And the third party ones require granting permissions which seems strange since it's only a watch face. Also it takes a couple of minutes just to download it to the watch which is strange because again, it's only a watch face.- notification sync is stupid. If you take your watch off you'll continue to get notifications on your phone AND watch so your watch will vibrate loudly despite not being on your wrist.- it will not give you a sleep score if you start the sleep tracker manually from the app. You have to let it auto track your sleep and theres no visual feedback to tell you that auto tracking is working. So cross your fingers and hope the next morning to see a sleep score.- auto sleep tracking seems okay at first but there's very very little supplemental info provided to back up the sleep score they give you. I can get a 60 one night and an 80 the next and I don't feel any different. Fitbit only provides a couple short blurbs about the numbers and doesn't go into the details. Because it's their own proprietary sleep tracking system you also can't just Google it for more info.- Fitbit advertise all over about the always on display but when you actually try to enable this they warn you that it will hurt your battery life. I end up not using it much.- The automatic screen wake works really poorly. Half the time it doesn't wake up and you have to double tap the screen to get it to wake (that tip btw was hard to find). And, if using always on display then you always have to either double tap the screen or hit the button to wake the watch which is really cumbersome.- one small hardware frustration. The charger is just perplexing. They made it so that the warch can sit in the charging cradle in either direction but it only has one set of charging pins so in fact it can only charge when attached in a specific direction - which you have pay close attention too. Pebble had a design like this as well but unlike fitbit they made it possible to charge in either direction to avoid confusion like this.- the charger also can't sit flat. There's no elegance to it like the apple watch charger. Its like they expect it to just sit pilled in a corner or soemthing.- vO2 sensor thing. Supposedly the hardware to check your blood oxygen level is in the watch already but the software isn't ready yet/waiting for FDA approval. Either way. There's been no communication from fitbit to consumers about when this will be available and without a published roadmap its hard to believe this feature will actually happen.They should have just waited and released the watch after getting ALL the big features completed and all the major bugs worked out.I wanted to like this. Hardware seems great, sleep tracking okay, battery life excellent. The software is just so poorly implemented though that it makes this device infuriating to use. Totally worth it at $100 bucks but not for $230+tax"
11,G. Castle,2,the United States ,4-Sep-21,"Not bad, but not great","This review is split into two parts: one for the tracker itself and one for the app and company. My overall rating for this product is 2.5 Stars.Versa 2: 3.5 StarsI had my Versa 2 for a year and a half before it had a quick downward spiral from the touchscreen acting up a bit to completely nonfunctional within two weeks. While I am not impressed with the longevity, I found the watch to be useful and handy but also lacking for the cost. For context, I paid around $150 on a sale, and not long after I believe it went on sale for $130, but even judging by the $150 price and not the full price, it is disappointing.Pros-Tracking: For others, this may be a Con since I cannot verify how precise the tracking is, but as someone who uses it more casually, I found it to be perfectly fine. It did a reasonable job at tracking my steps, logging my exercises, and telling me how I slept.-Apps: Aside from the default apps, additional apps can be installed. You can rearrange the apps too to put the useful apps in easier access. Generally, I found it easier to use apps on my phone but some like the alarms and timers are great.-Customization: One big positive for the Versa 2 is that it is fairly customizable. It can change its clockface from a huge selection and easily swap between them. You can also swap out the watch bands.Cons-Alexa Support: This is an awesome feature in concept, but the majority of the time it failed to work. At least 4/5 times when I tried to use it, it would tell me it couldn't connect and to set it up in the app (it was already set up). It was so inconsistent that I stopped using it over more reliable means.-Bands: As nice it is to be able to change the bands, it is annoying to swap them. Other trackers like the Charge 4 can swap bands far more easily.-Interfaces: This is a more minor nitpick, but something about the look of the apps reminded me of a decade-old device rather than something modern.-Longevity: If you told me when I bought this that it would only last 1.5 years before breaking (averaging $8+ a month), I probably would have gotten something else instead. If you are used to upgrading devices often, this may not be a big deal but as someone who wanted a device for the next 3-5 years, this majorly underperformed.Fitbit: 1.5 StarsThe AppIn terms of content, the app is pretty nice. It displays the information from the tracker nicely and it lets you input additional data to track weight, food, water, and exercises. However, it has one glaring problem: connectivity. The trackers need the app to sync the data and from my experience, it likes to not do this for seemingly no reason. If you search ""Fitbit won't sync"" or look at the app reviews, you'll probably find I am not alone in this issue. Sometimes the troubleshooting like restarting Bluetooth or my phone will help but other times I can try every trick and it still won't manage to sync, then a day or two later it will start working again. At times it is so bad that I'd get my weekly report email and half the week with have nothing because it went that long without syncing. Other trackers may run into similar issues, but I don't recall it being nearly this bad with my old Fitbit One, which synced with an adapted on the desktop, so since new trackers only work with the app that seems to be at least part of the problem.The CompanyBefore the Versa 2, I had a Fitbit One that I used so much I needed my third replacement strap. To the best of my knowledge, that Fitbit One still works fine as ever. When the Blaze transition to Versa, I noticed far more negative reviews pointing out issues. I hoped the next model would be better, but the same problems seemed to persist or even gotten worse. And based on my own experiences, these new trackers do feel subpar and not as good as they used to be.After my Versa 2 broke, just after the year warranty, support did offer me a 30% discount on a new tracker through their website. Unfortunately, this didn't count for much as they'd run a sale within the week offering around 20% off. I ended up getting a Charge 4 and the tracker is pretty good, especially for what I paid, but the company stooped to a new low by dropped support for my device right after I ordered and failing to notify me, then giving me terrible support to the point it was insulting and refusing to accept any returns or offer any compensation for effectively delivering a product different to the one I ordered.Overall, I would not recommend a Fitbit. Personally, I am looking into other trackers/smartwatches, specifically Garmin. But if you want to try a Fitbit, I'd suggest a Charge or similar model over a Versa. Also, I'd look out for a sale, which tends to happen multi times a year."
12,Renaissance Man n Modern World,2,the United States ,25-Oct-22,"I love my Fitbit, but I cannot do this relationship anymore!","Within the last 6 years, I have purchased a total of 4 Fitbits. Yes four! I've become comfortable with the interface and have relied on the information it provides me. However, the last two Fitbits I have purchased within the last 2 years, the watch face has fallen off right outside of the limited warranty phase. When I purchased my original Fitbit  versa, I purchased at Best Buy and  I was told they no longer sold warranties for this watch through geek squad. But I went ahead and purchased anyway, because I liked the device. This device began to go faulty at about a year and a half to two years. I then upgraded to a versa 2, this device lasted for approximately a year and a half, maybe a little less. I then purchased another versa 2, In September of 2021, through Amazon. We are now at the end of October of 2022 and as I am wearing my watch on my wrist, the watch face just drops out hanging from the wire. I proceed to try to put it back in and when I did so, the watch face turned white, with streaks of color.  I actually contacted customer service to see if I could get a possible discount for another watch even though I was outside of the warranty by about a month. I knew the chances were slim that I would get any satisfaction, but you can't blame me for trying as this was a $160 purchase that only lasted a little over a year. A customer should have some satisfaction without having to purchase a warranty, that a product such as a sports watch would have some durability and that the manufacturer would take some pride in the quality and workmanship for such an expensive device. I just can't do it anymore!!!"
13,Dan G.,2,the United States ,20-Oct-22,Need to know before buying!,"I bought the fitbit because I found out in my family we are susceptible to Afib, so upon learning that I decided to get a fitbit to track my sleep breathing and also heart rate. After I got it and set it up and everything I put it on my wrist like I do watches and it wouldn't read my heart rate. I had family members try it on and it read theirs no problem. So I put it on the inside of my wrist and it read my heart rate.LONG STORY SHORT (and I had to call fitbit for this) IF YOU HAVE TATTOOS ON TOP OF YOUR WRIST the fitbit will not read your heart rate. I thought that made absolutely no sense but they said the fitbit can't read through the ink. Even though I have full sleeves. The inside of my wrist that's tattooed as well it can read my heart rate but not the top part of my wrist.I just found it interesting that that was the case. I thought I was dead inside and had no pulse or because it was me being a 300 lb athletic guy with thick skin. But sure enough it's because of the tattoos.Where it DOES NOT state anywhere that you shouldn't purchase this if you have tattoos because I wouldn't have had I known this. So an error on fitbit for not putting that in their disclaimer."
14,Shelby Rider,2,the United States ,16-Nov-22,NOT A Good Investment,"When I first got it - everything worked and all was well. Not quite two years in the watch screen was only responsive about half the time unless I didn’t wear it for a day or two then all of a sudden it was fine. The company was generous enough to send me a replacement, which worked for about a year and a half then IT started having issues with the watch screen. So for the last 6 months I’ve been alternating the watch faces, using one until it stopped working then swapping to the other one to give the first one a break. Now neither one is working. Just don’t spend your money on this. It’s taken too much of my time, energy, and stress trying to get these things to work. I will NEVER buy Fitbit again.Side note: it was always the watch itself acting up, never the app."
15,electrlux,2,the United States ,21-Feb-22,Frustratingly clunky interface constant Bluetooth disconnect,I had high hopes for this watch taking a chance and paying three times as much as dozens of other watches that look identical. With the name Fitbit being one of the most well-known and will established smartwatch manufacturers I expected they would have their act together.1. The interface / getting around the software on this watch is clunky at best awkward and disorganized.  Just trying to find the most basic of features on a smartwatch... . The sleep module is ridiculously hard to do. It's easy to find heart rate monitor calorie burning and step counting but try to find the icon for the sleep feature... Go ahead try!!The $30 smartwatch I purchased previous to this that looked identicle in shape and size I was easily able to find an spo2 feature. On this watch the feature does not appear as a separate module and when I try to download a watch face that displays spo2 it says it's unavailable for this model.Bluetooth: I have never had a smart device disconnect from Bluetooth as often as this one does.  It seems like every 10 minutes it's asking me if I want to pair the device.  in 2022 this is unacceptable. When I  search for solutions none of them seem to fix this consistently.Sleep monitoring.  My Galaxy watch monitors my sleep automatically and is relatively accurate.  The first night I had this watch on my wrist I woke up in the middle of the night took a look and not one ounce of sleep was monitored..... Since I can't even find a sleep module on the watch I look to my smartphone in the app and shows zero sleep tracking activity monitored. Maybe because the Bluetooth can't seem to get attacked together between the watch and the app?Doing good thing I had to say about this watch is that it was very accurate when I monitored my activity on my treadmill and my weight lifting and it is nice that it has food module you can log the food you eat.My wife who has sleep apnea is especially disappointed in this device not being able to monitor her sleep.  If I can't get this resolved I'm going to have to return both watches hers and mine.  They been manufacturing smart watches I think longer than anyone else..... You think after all this time they could have their act together?
16,Robert Z.,2,the United States ,15-Nov-20,Underwhelming,"After about a month of use all I can really say about it is ""meh"".Cons - (if you workout a lot) I found wearing this for so many active hours a week caused sores on my wrist. The material of the strap will do a number on your skin. I rotate wrists, right now the sores on the left wrist are recovering while the strap destroys my right wrist. - Heart rate monitor isn't reliable. I've had it strapped really tightly to my wrist, yet if I'm getting very active the heartrate screen blinks out as if there is no contact with my wrist. I have a medical grade heart rate monitor, I compared it to that one in real time. The Fitbit is off, usually by 5-7~. - The shortcut key is very annoying. Frequently when doing sphinx pushups or just pushups in general the key is depressed by my wrist. Alexa or whatever else pops up. Might as well set the shortcut key to nothing. - I turned on the 'Lock device if it leaves your wrist"" security feature. Even though its strapped tightly, I have to enter the code about every other 10 minutes. - The workout menu is full of activities I do not give a single shit about. I cannot remove them or add activities I  DO CARE about. - Spotify link to your phone is horrible, not sure why I'd ever want to use it. Half the time it says it cant find your phone, even though you repeatedly sync it. Spent more time trying to make it work than I actually functionally used it. - Quality of audio output to a speaker or blue tooth headphones is absolutely horrible. - The cardio fitness score makes zero sense. It started really high for me, then by the end of the month its telling me POOR to FAIR 31-35, ""Poor fitness for men your age"". I do at least 15 hours of cardio a week on a bad week, and a full lifting schedule. So I assume the rating is completely meaningless.Pros - Workout tracker is decent. Aside from the preset workout activities you cannot remove. - A selection of free clockfaces to find a display of information to your liking. Its not a very big selection though. - There is a method for adding and paying with credit cards using the device itself. I have not used this however, the security is dubious. - The phone app adds a lot. Its easier to track your calories and water on the phone, you can search from a lot of pre-made entries for common meals, organic breads, meats, etc. Pretty convenient for tracking your calories and water input. - There are a few handy apps you can get for free installed to the watch. Particularly handy is the 'Find your phone' app, for those of us who can't manage to leave it where we can find it."
17,Hammer75,2,the United States ,17-Sep-22,Stopped working in a shallow pool-NOT WATER-RESISTANT!,"There are many features of the Versa 2 that I really like so I was very disturbed to get it wet for the FIRST TIME, submerging it in a pool around 6"" for around 15 minutes, after which it completely stopped working.  Other than its failure in the water, I really love the alarm feature as it doesn't wake up anyone other than me.  The distance tracker is quite accurate and being able to configure the 'watch face' is fabulous as I can configure the time to be large so I can read it without glasses during the night.  I view the sleep analysis every day and it correlates with my own estimation of how well I slept.  There are many other features (e.g., reading texts on the screen, etc) which I haven't used so I won't comment on those. So, FITBIT, either make your device truly water-resistant ... OR... remove any reference to water-resistance!  Yes, I'm replacing the defunct VERSA 2 with another, but am starting to investigate other devices for next replacement."
18,Jason C.,2,the United States ,5-Dec-22,Not Reliable for Fitness,"If you're looking for an affordable watch to receive text messages, this is a good fit.  If you're looking for something to keep track of your heart rate during exercising, then this is not the right fit for you.  I'm highly disappointed in the inability of the Fitbit to track my heart rate, as soon as I start to sweat.  Since the watch is unable to accurately track my heart rate during exercise, then the calorie count is adversely affected as well.  Just something to be aware of before deciding to purchase."
19,Chris S.,2,the United States ,16-Nov-22,Leaves a lot to be desired.,"Pro'sComfortableHeart rate monitor is vey good. Its within 1 beat of my wahoo chest strap.Battery life is very good. I get a week out of it.ConsSleep tracking is awful.Exercise tracking is non existent, unless your walking or tell it what your doing. Ex. I have a spinbike . If I set it before exercise its fine, but if I forget it doesnt log any excersice even at 135 bpm for 30 mins.Its basically a very expensive digital watch.If you can get it under 75.00. Its ok, but there are much better watches out there. Especially if you need smartwatch functions"
20,Amazon Customer,3,the United States ,20-Aug-22,Would love it more if it were accurate,"The Device: I love the design and comfort of the watch. It’s display is simple and has all the items I wanted. The main face shows steps, pulse rate, calories burned, and the time and date. You can swipe to track exercise and multiple other features with a simple press of a button. You can program your regular forms of exercise to show up first so you can quickly select without having to scroll through a huge list. Battery lasts 4+ days of regular daily use. Charges quickly within a couple of hours. The problem I have is that the values of pulse rate and calories may not be entirely accurate. I recently confirmed that the pulse is extremely off. I chose the Fitbit over Apple Watch primarily because everything was in one app and because the heart rate was supposed to be more continuously monitored. I had a stress test done at a cardiology office and was wearing my Fitbit. My heart rate increased to 170 during the stress test and at the same moment the Fitbit said my pulse was 117. It said I never even reached the “cardio zone.” I also have noticed other times when I looked at the watch face and it said my pulse was higher like 125 and it never recorded on the app and showed my highest heart rate was 101 or something much lower.The App: I love that the app has all the features in one place. Other watches requires multiple apps to track food intake, steps, exercise, etc. My biggest problem with this app is that there are a lot of inaccuracies. The food tracking has some values for nutrients that are extremely off. Every day it says I’m consuming 10,000+ % of my iron which is far from the truth. I’ve logged a lot of foods that I have to adjust the calculations because the macronutrients are inaccurate. I recently caught a food item that I verified had about 12g of sugar and the app logged it at 74g of sugar. That’s a huge margin of error!! So I have to monitor my entries way too close and it’s really annoying. If I didn’t know so much about nutrition I’d be really concerned if I was looking at my daily nutrition report. I log everything I eat and drink into the tracker and really wish it was accurate. The heart rate log does not match my watch face. As I mentioned above, I have looked at the watch face to see it was measuring my pulse rate at a high number like 125 then it never recorded me going over 101 for the day. I wonder how accurate the sleep log is because I really love looking at my sleep record but now question how accurate it is.Overall: The Fitbit has helped me gather some useful data for my health and fitness goals, however the accuracy of the data is questionable. The simplicity is the best part but I think it is important not to rely on it too much due to the issues with accuracy as I mentioned. If they could improve the app and sensor accuracy this would be an amazing product."
21,Homeschool Mom,3,the United States ,29-Feb-20,"Overall, Underwhelming","Very reluctantly, I had to admit that my 2nd Pebble Round was no longer worth nursing along. The battery was done, and support for the product long since ended.Versa 2, with its fairly low price point, 3+ day battery life, heart rate tracking, and ability to verbally respond to texts - plus use most Alexa features - seemed like a decent replacement. (Pebble's ability to respond to texts was one of its major selling points, until the feature died with the product support!)Unfortunately, after wearing it for about 10 weeks, I remain underwhelmed.Let's start with the good, though* Battery life really is in the 3 day range* Bright, legible display. I found a decent free watch face that displays on an angle, so your arm can stay at a more natural one.* Comfortable strap, nice look overall.* I don't really have a baseline for sleep or heart rate tracking, but it seems to work fine.But now, the not so good.* Connectivity to my Moto Z Play is spotty at best. Unlike the Pebble with its bluetooth icon right on the watch face, the watch itself gives you few indications about whether it's communicating with your phone. Your first clue is usually when you hear your phone binging, but realize you got no corresponding buzz on your wrist.Long story short, my experience is that once connectivity is lost, rebooting the phone is my only option. No amount of begging for a re-sync through the app, or even force-quitting the app is going to cut it.I doubt I've ever gone 24 hours without losing connectivity either - frankly, I think simply stepping out of Bluetooth range is enough to kill it most of the time.I know this works better on other phones, but as I am not looking to replace my beloved Moto Z, this is cold comfort.* When everything is connecting nicely, the voice-to-text feature works pretty well. Except that sometimes it gives every indication of having sent your text, but it never actually makes it out of the ether. I won't venture to guess how frequently it fails, because frankly I don't get to use the feature (for the reason above) enough to have a good idea.* The app itself is not particularly intuitive. I know I've bought into the Fitbit ecosystem here, and that the same app does for many devices. But I wish it were a bit more device-centric and spent less time trying to upsell me on premium features.At first, the app was crashing constantly, and noisily, several times a day. An update sometime in late January or early February (to the firmware?) seems to have addressed that. Now it just doesn't really like to sync. :)* I seriously question the step-count. I have GoogleFit installed on my phone. My Pebble's step count and the phone's step count were always within single-digit percents of each other, unless of course I'd put the phone down for long periods of exercise.The Versa 2 on the other hand consistently reports a step count 20% higher than my phone.Without a lot more research and motivation I obviously can't prove which device is more accurate, but let's just say the Versa is the ""minority report."" The minor attention I've paid to the issue suggests that the Versa picks up and counts a lot more random non-walking movement than the Pebble, as the phone and watch seem to stay in closer agreement when I am actually on a long walk.  (Oh, and while we're at it, wouldn't it be nice if the Versa could sync with Google Fit?!)To sum up, I would Happily add a fourth star if this silly watch just stayed connected with the phone without all the drama of silent failures and annoying reboots. But as it stands, I have found myself less and less motivated to do those reboots and just lived with a largely crippled watch, without consistent and reliable access to many of the features that I was most looking forward to, and - I might add - just Worked on the Pebble."
22,Gerry Thurston,3,the United States ,2-Dec-22,Important to know before buying!!!!!,"Versa 2 does NOT support personal music any longer.  I successfully transferred music on my first Versa 2; however, when I tried to transfer music on my new Versa 2, Fitbit Customer Support, told me they are promoting the Versa 4 and no longer support the personal music functionality for Versa 2.  False advertising!!!!!"
23,MN,3,the United States ,17-Nov-22,Not new,"Bought this as a gift and gave it anyway as time was an issue. Product box was opened and retaped and a weird code sticker on outside.  Inside all the safety tape was remived and it was just in the box, not as a new watch!  Trashy that amazon resold an already opened item at the new price!  I'm hoping it works as should. But leave yourself time to return if they send you an opened/used item!"
24,Amazon Customer,3,the United States ,12-Oct-20,"Decent, but don't expect this to be at an Apple Watch or Garmin level of quality","Disclaimer: I've since just bit the bullet and purchased an Apple Watch Series 6, as this product was sufficient for a while but did not ultimately suit my needs.The FitBit Versa 2 is a perfectly fine steps and activity counter and tracker. It is comfortable to wear all day and keeps a charge very well. In addition, the sleep tracking and heart rate tracking features are great. If you are in the market for a budget activity tracker, this is a great option for under $200. I purchased the Special Edition, which came with the woven band and also a silicone band. I actually stopped wearing the woven band, as it became uncomfortable rather fast. The silicone worked great.The issue with this device is that it does not display miles walked on the actual watch (you have to access the app for that) and also there are some serious issues with the tracking of calories burned/how many calories you should consume during the day. I'm 5'4"" and weigh 180 pounds, and I walk around 6-7 miles per day. Because of the weird algorithm within the FitBit system, it tells me that I should be consuming between 3,000-3,500 calories per day, as a result of my level of exercise. Walking 6-7 miles burns around 350-400 calories, which for someone of my height and weight (which I entered into my profile on the app) means that I should actually consume between 1,800-2,200 calories per day, once the exercise is factored in. My assumption is that there is some level of heart rate + steps + whatever variables that cause the astronomically high calorie level to be shown. This is a legitimate problem for someone who wants to use their fitness device to actually help them maintain or lose weight. FitBit would be better off removing that functionality from their devices until they can fix that bug. I have seen others complain about similar things, and I've even seen articles in tech magazines called ""Is Your FitBit Making You Fat?""The Display is nice looking; it looks very sleek and well constructed, and is bright. The phone pairing works nicely but without the ability to actually function as a true extension of the phone (texting/calls/etc, as with the Apple or Samsung watches) it's more of a novelty than anything else.I've had this device for four months and I've enjoyed it. It has helped me to get my body moving more, and it was affordable enough that I just bought my wife and I each one at the same time. That being said, now that I'm ready to really start using my fitness tracker to help me prepare for some significant hikes and runs, I needed something better. The Apple Watch Series 6 is miles ahead of this in terms of look, functionality, and true fitness tracking. The blood oxygen monitoring and sleep monitoring are very similar, which I give FitBit credit for. If you are willing to drop $500 instead of $200, I suggest going for the Apple Watch. If you are looking for something on a budget, this is perfectly acceptable. You will just need to fully and completely ignore the calorie tracking, and you'll need to access your phone app for information about the miles you've gone or flights you've accomplished.3/5"
25,Navneeth Jayendran,3,the United States ,17-Oct-21,The watch had only one or two jobs and did them poorly.,"* The watch is too weak to do anything particularly useful. The UI is very limited and many of the apps can't be adjusted at all on the watch itself. You can't even adjust interval times for an interval workout on the watch. As a result, I don't use the watch apps for much.* It shows phone calls and email notifications. The phone call notifications are alright, but the email notifications arrive in massive batches that can obscure your current workout view.* No built-in GPS so you need to bring your phone along for accurate workout statistics, making its advantages over a mobile phone even smaller.* The two things it adds on top of a regular mobile phone fitness app are sleep tracking and heart rate monitoring. Sleep tracking is alright and much easier than remembering when I actually fell asleep, though I'm not sure how accurate some of the sleep phase measurements are. Heart rate monitoring is rather terrible whenever you are doing exercises with high heart rate variability such as intervals. For me, it consistently undercounts my heart rate with laughably high errors. A 15 second count of my carotid artery gives a heart rate of 160, whereas the watch gives a rate of 115. I can get more accuracy from a 3 second count of my carotid than this without paying over $150.* The app is decent for calorie tracking, step counting, checking hours where you met the 250 step goal, etc. Though you can get the app for free and use mobile tracking for free. Beware: the mobile tracker tripled my footsteps one day so I had to disable it.* Not enough features for an app that has so few jobs. Workout groups exist with features like contests. But there are no contests for things like mile time, etc. It largely centers around steps. The calorie tracker doesn't support ""calorie builder"" features of any kind, only custom dish entries that can be scaled by servings or serving size.* I've seen insane bugs such as interval times constantly getting reset by the watch after adjusting them from the mobile app. This is especially funny since the watch doesn't let you set interval times. How can it mess up the interval times when it doesn't even allow you to set interval times? You tell me.* The watch has pretty good battery time. I've only ever had it die on me once or twice. I charge it around twice a week and use it around the clock, even when showering most of the time. Though it started to cause my skin to peel after a month. This has improved since I started washing it more often and not wearing it in the shower.It's definitely better than not having a fitness watch or using a fitness app. However, I would recommend spending more money for a higher quality product like an Apple Watch."
26,David & JudyPaul,3,the United States ,28-Nov-22,Ok Could Be A Lot Better,"Watch works well. Poor battery life. Abismal app.  Hrad to get things to sync from the watch.  Tried different devices, still, it takes a long time if you can even get it to sync.  Previous synced data may disappear after subsequent syncs."
27,Allison,3,the United States ,15-Aug-22,Very frustratingly disappointed! I need my music!,"I have owned the original Versa for quite a few years with absolutely no complaints functioned perfectly until recently it completely broke. Ordered the Versa 2 for a slight upgrade and realized after much distress that there is no means of downloading music to it. What happened??? I bought this product specifically for this reason I use the offline music feature daily gym,work,cleaning and just to unwind. Sadly, I would have not purchased again knowing that there is absolutely no way to listen. Pandora (which I pay for) does not work at all can't even log in just keeps turning. Called Fitbit support who stated they have had multiple complaints and I would be put on the list of non working Pandora. No resolution and no idea when or if it will be running again. Downloaded Deezer also never loads just keeps saying one more sec... forever. Went to Spotify it no longer offers offline listening. Tried the personal music transfer option and apparently this year that to has been discontinued. Very frustrating to say the least purchased for the fitness options of course but the ability to listen to music through my Versa was a top priority. Wish my old one would have not busted because with it I got what I wanted. Why is it when you ""upgrade"" you lose all the things that matted most!"
28,Ron,3,the United States ,11-Oct-22,Disappointment,"Increasingly unhappy after 9 months. Accuracy in sleep and exercise questionable. Example from this morning: On elliptical, this device showed bpm = 158 while the elliptical's monitor showed 114. My body would have sent an emphatic message if I was at 158. Later, on a treadmill, this device reported 68, while the machine reported 107. My resting bpm is around 65 and I was not resting.With sleep monitoring, the results have shown sleep starting 1 to 2 hours after I know that I fell asleep.I appeciate that there will be measurement error with these devices. But not of the magnitude that I have experienced. And the inconsistency calls reliability into question.I would not have bought this device knowing what I know now."
29,Mose,3,the United States ,4-Oct-22,It too impressive,"Sleep monitoring is not accurate at all. Many apps that you don't want on the Versa2 you can't remove. Not functional GPS. Music is a hassle (forget listening to music). However, the charge time is good, nice choice of watch faces, heart rate is ""iffy"". Watch band is interchangeable with watch band selection. I like to ride my bikes but there is no consistency in distance and mileage. I managed to graduate up from the first Fitbit to the Fitbit 2, but cost is the only reason I have one. Doesn't seem to have very much competition in price and style. I don't want a big clock on my wrist like some others, but to each their own."
30,Just Theo,4,the United States ,27-Jan-20,Love Alexa on my wrist! (wish it wasn't FitBit),"FITBIT overall score: 2 stars. I'm going to put this out there..... I am not a fan of fitbit. I think it's crap that you have to pay extra for services they advertise. I get it if they have extra stuff like coaches and videos, but the tracker related stuff should not be charged for. I tried the premium membership and I prefer beachbody workout on my TV than the tiny screen on my phone giving me a workout.... and if I was traveling and had no choice, I could still use my beachbody app. The only feature that I would have used is the sleep insights and I am not going to pay for a membership to use one feature that I don't really care about.  I also dislike the fact that they hype you up and act like they will consider a new feature and I have yet to see them implement a single feature I have voted for. They leave it under consideration for months and then say 'nope'.  Their reminders to move feature is only useful if you're a total couch potato and want to be reminded to get up for the last 10 minutes of your hour. I wanted to use it to remind me to move if I haven't reached my own hourly goal.... you're stuck with their 250 step hourly goal. You can't change when the reminder to move goes off either. Sooo, say I want to set an hourly goal of 1000 steps, the reminder to move sounded 10 minutes before the end of the hour (and only if I haven't taken 250 steps) By the time I could find the graph with my hourly steps and mouse over each section to get the actual count and then add up each count, my 10 minutes was almost up. If I can't change the 250 step count, it's not motivating me to move MORE than I already do. If I can't change when to remind me, then I don't have a chance of completing it. What if my work break is at the beginning of the hour and I forgot to take my steps? The ability to change the hourly step goal and the reminder times are a simple fix and Fitbit closes their ears to people.On my fitbit charge 3, I had a work around and set a silent alarm on the fitbit app to remind me to complete my own step goal. This was fun, because I had to write down the steps I had already taken for the day and then get my steps in. I spent more time sitting in front of my computer trying to figure out how many steps I took than I did actually taking steps some day. The funny thing is, on the versa 2, it actually does show me my steps this hour... but only until I reach the 250 step goal and then I am back to using the graph on my phone again. Now the even funnier thing is, Fitbit has removed this feature of setting silent alarms on the app. At least for the Versa 2. I googled where it was and searched for THREE hours, it's no longer there. I even watched a video that was on youtube showing it was there two months ago, but when I followed the steps, my screen didn't match up with the video. I can set a silent alarm from my watch, but only 8 alarms total, so I can't set an alarm to go off each hour for 12 hours to get 1000 steps each hour...... And the hours I need it to go off changes depending on the day of the week. The other feature complaint is the 'relax feature' I like it, BUT you can only set it for 2 or 5 minutes.... why the restriction? Why can't I pick 10? 15? Set my own? It's not relaxing to reset it every 5 minutes for 15 minutes.My final complaint with fitbit (there really are more, but these are the biggest ones), the user manual within the app is USELESS. Take the above example of silent alarms. If I go to the 'how to use' section and click on silent alarm section, you would expect a walk through of how to set a silent alarm, right? No, this is literally what is says: Silent alarms: Set a silent alarm on Versa 2. Your device gently vibrates to wake you up in the morning or alert you at a certain time of day. If you don't dismiss an alarm, it goes off again in 9 minutes. (Btw, when I got the charge 3, it took FOREVER to figure out how to dismiss a silent alarm instead of snoozing it). And this is how the entire 'how to use' portion is on the app. It's all a description on what each feature is used for, no instructions on how to set it up. Notifications? Timers? Alarms? Quick Replies? Weather?Be prepared to google search how to do EVERYTHING other than how to remove the wrapping from your watch.So why the 5 stars? Well, I knew when I bought this watch that I think fitbit trackers are the dumbest of the trackers. BUT when I got the Charge 3, I had a newborn baby. I was going to return it the day I bought it, however I discovered one redeeming quality.... it will notify me by vibrating when I have a call. I am on the clock 24 hours a day and when you have a newborn baby, the phone ringing is frustrating. Missed calls when the phone was on silent. So the notifications and quick replies gave me a reason to keep it. So I can't give a crappy review of fitbit on this device when I knew going in that it wasn't going to be what I wanted for a tracker. I gave it a crappy review on the Charge 3.But this time, I bought this one due to Alexa being on the watch. I have a Fire TV, an echo show, 2 echo dots, a kindle fire and a kindle paperwhite, (earbuds are on the way) I am a prime member and I have several subscribe and save items. My whole world is tied together on this watch. My packages come? Shopping list? Whatever reminders I setup through Alexa comes on my watch too. I can watch my workout on the firetv and if the baby needs me, press the button on my watch and have it pause the TV.... I can't tell you how many times I have had to look for the remote in the baby's toybox just to pause the tv, then rewind and pause.... lol. I know that amazon music is not tied to the versa, I am hopeful that Amazon flexes a little muscle and gets it. Or google buys fitbit out and uses common sense and adds it as a feature. But the notifications from my phone, the link to Alexa were enough for me to upgrade from the Charge 3. I have found I like the clock faces for the versa 2 and the ability to see more of my stats from the watch and less looking at the app. And being able to have Alexa log my food on myfitnesspal for me is nice too.Ok, one final complaint about fitbit..... versa 2 has Alexa.... common sense to have amazon music, right? Nope they must be getting money from Spotify and Deezer to keep it off there. But I am not paying for a second service for music when I get amazon music with everything else I need, shipping, movies, tv shows, smart house controls.UPDATE: disappointed with bluetooth range. The watch disconnects from my phone a lot. I know that some of this is the phone, however my apartment is small and my Charge 3 never lost connection while I was home. I sit my phone on my desk to keep it out of reach of my toddler and rely on my watch to notify me if I have a call (can't hear the ringer with the toddler and kids). Realistically, I am usually within 10 feet of my phone 90% of the time, 15 feet if I am in the kitchen. I will go to use spotify from my kitchen and it will tell me connection is lost."
31,Sakura,4,the United States ,22-Nov-20,Excellent smartwatch on a budget. Software is a hot mess.,"As a small disclaimer - I bought my Versa 2 through a local retailer earlier in the year since I was able to take such an amount off with coupons. Were it not for that though I probably would still be using my first FitBit watch, an Alta HR to this moment. The deal was hard to pass up and just for $10 more I bought some extra bands and cases here on Amazon, perfect for me so I could keep my motivation at a high as I was expecting to be home quarantining for months.THE PROS/FEATURES:- A step-up from any old FitBit model on a budget (especially if you can get one for under $150 USD).- Battery is advertised to last 5 days, but you can potentially stretch it 1-2 days past that point.- In addition to the battery life, this thing charges pretty fast!- AMOLED screen - beautiful picture on a small screen, and plenty bright to see outside on a sunny day.- Very easy to wear for hours at a time, even through periods of sleep.- Accurate heart rate readings; I've noticed taking my own pulse the watch is at most 3-4 BPM off.- Application support, with a few standard with the watch - Spotify, Pandora, Alexa to name a few.- Able to setup push notifications right to your watch, from nearly every app. Even simple stuff like the news.- Appealing watch faces, with many custom choices available for download.- Waterproof to an extent, can even setup exercises for swimming activities- Able to time and track specific physical activities, including sports and use of workout equipment.- Integrated feature to find your phone by setting off a LOUD noise; do not do this with headphones in!- Able to answer or deny calls right from your watch, even supporting iOS.- Ability to track your sleep, though not perfect and some insights on that data gets locked behind a paywall.- Fun challenges to take on yourself, or compete with others.OKAY/SUB-PAR:- A majority of custom watch faces are paid, and it is a pain to determine which are free or need to be bought.- Some durability issues, which could be partially adverted with third-party cases/screen protectors.- Current price should be lowered given the recent release of the Versa 3 and Sense.- Included charger does not support watch cases, and the charging cord should be way longer.- Lack of customization when the always-on display is in use.- Cannot use applications such as Spotify or Pandora without relevant subscriptions.- The only way you can power off or reset the watch is a hidden option in the ""About"" area under settings.- Alexa app has no audio feedback and will lack full functionality w/o Alexa app installed on your phone.- Offers use of a tool like FitBit pay, but you can't use FitBit pay for things like watch faces or subscriptions.- Google Assistant now supported, only for the newer watches despite previously announced to support Versa 2.- Weather app will ask you to sync if it's been awhile, will not show any weather otherwise.- App choices are slim and are nothing compared to what you'd see on other high-end smart watches.- Should let users have more information you can track, such as how Apple lets you record things such as symptoms.THE CONS:- No built-in GPS and instead relies on your phone to track location.- Cannot respond to texts from app (such as a pre-canned message) on iOS, supported on Android.- Bare minimum Alexa features such as no support to control smart home devices.- Zero integration with Google or Apple's health applications.- Many features locked behind premium service, despite ownership of a spendy watch.- No speaker, but I suppose this makes sense given it's a watch and not a phone.- Warranty is not done directly through Fitbit, and they may likely direct you to Square Trade.- Lackluster customer service and have personally experienced two cases of rude customer service agents.- If you have a feature, you have to go to a vote-based suggestion forum that is essentially a graveyard for all sorts of user-submitted ideas (some examples on this later).THE BAD, UGLY:This completely concerns the Fitbit application, because I have such a strong dislike for it. First off, there's often troubles with syncing whether it be syncing your watch where you'll sometimes get the message it cannot find your Fitbit device - this even extends to little things like Spotify, so about once or twice a month I have to sign out and sign back in to get the Spotify app to work. What's more is sometimes the app bugs out in little places, I'll have times where I want to switch or install a watch face and it will get stuck (to the point of where the only fix is to change the face manually from the watch, and restart my phone). It's also worth mentioning there are Mac and Windows versions of the Fitbit app but they're a colossal waste of time and not fully-fledged with features like the mobile versions. Last but not least what bugs me the most is a lack of a dark mode (despite having previously suggested by users over 5+ years) which includes both the iOS and Android applications. On iOS there is also no home screen widget support, a feature Apple rolled out with their most recent firmware update. Finally and as mentioned earlier there are a number of features locked behind a premium plan which includes things like better insights on your data, workout tips and even simple recipes - this will cost you a hefty $120 a year via. monthly plan or just under $80 through an annual yearly plan; for a watch you have already paid over a hundred dollars for.OVERALL THOUGHTS:For how big the smart watch market is today, the Versa 2 being now in the past generation of Fitbit's watches still holds up well with the caveat the sale price still hasn't been lowered, which definitely should be the case as new watches (and even those not from Fitbit) are out with more and better features. This is a perfect option for somebody on a budget, especially if you're an existing owner of a Fitbit watch. But because there are other options out there such as Garmin, Apple, and even Samsung you may want to do heavy research on what fits you best.Personally speaking this is my fourth year of using Fitbit devices and may consider a new model when I have the money to upgrade. However with the pile of issues the application has, the absence of not considering ideas from the community and even the price for what they are I am thinking also about other brands for my next watch."
32,Sabrinna,4,the United States ,13-Nov-22,"Tracker, watch, digital assistant helper","I loved my previous Fitbit trackers but I'm not a fan of watches. Saying I rarely wear a watch is an understatement. I enjoyed my previous tracker (Fitbit Inspire HR) for tracking sleep, steps, exercise, setting alarms, etc, (its ability to provide the time was good but not necessary) but when it broke in a way that it could not be used as previously, I decided to do an upgrade and got this one which looks more like a watch to me than a fitness tracker but in my older years I'm trying to venture out of my comfort zones. This thing works really well. Not only does it track my steps, sleep and exercise, I can also use it to give commands to Alexa and it works with that feature at least 90% of the time. Thus the reason for the 4 star review. Seems to fail more often when I am not home and I ask something like ""turn on the lights.""I get text notifications when my phone is within range and can decide if I need to get up to grab the phone to check the entire message or if it's something that can wait (like my group text with my cousins and they are complaining about sports which I don't watch). I also get notifications of who is calling when my phone is out of reach or in my pocket and decide if it's a call worth rushing to answer or something that can wait. I like that it's waterproof and relatively lightweight. It has alarms via vibrations which I haven't used with this one but I did use with my previous model. I no longer have need for the notifications but it's good to know they are there if I ever need them again. It has several clock faces to choose from and there are additional ones that can be downloaded from the Fitbit website to really provide a good variety of options. Right now I don't have any cons about it and I've been using it now for 9 months. I usually try to wait to write reviews so that I can give a more accurate and functional review and not just how it worked the 1st week."
33,Tori Kleine,4,the United States ,2-Dec-22,A great product,"I love how easy it is to change the look of my Versa 2 into something a touch more classy than a fitness tracker usually looks. Between the wide assortment of bands and clock faces, my Versa will look appropriate for work, a night out, or just putzing around the house.I bought it primarily for the sleep tracker, and it works wonderfully. It keeps track of naps during the day as well as each night, and there doesn't seem to be a minimal amount of time needed to sleep for it to register.It is Alexa compatible, but I was disappointed to find that there is no option to use my Amazon music account with my Versa. I don't use either Spotify or Pandora, so that isn't very helpful.There have been some issues syncing the fitbit with my phone, but there are several possibilities for why that is occurring, so don't let that dissuade you."
34,Shawna A.,4,the United States ,3-Feb-22,Fitbit Wearer for 10+ years,"Like many, I've been a Fitbit user for a very long time. Cycling through almost every new Fitness Tracker they came out with. My most recent of these being the Versa 2, it's comfortable and sleek looking.There are many things I really LOVE about this watch, but I'm beginning to wonder if maybe Fitbit is not putting enough quality into their products, and I'll tell you why below. However, I would love to share what I like about the watch, and some features that I use almost daily.Features I love, and use often:- I never realized how much I would use this feature, but I find it so very useful: The timer option. I don't use it for laps, or anything of that nature as you have that built into the exercise feature. However, I do use this to time my son's reading for homework. Grilling outside. Reminders of letting my animals back inside after being let out. And for so much more, I truly utilize this function on an almost daily basis. Such a great feature.- The exercise button. You can customize which exercise buttons are quick access, via the Fitbit App. This is useful because I do most of the same type of exercises on a regular basis, and this makes it easy. The one downfall here is that if you chose to activate the GPS option for a more accurate distance calculation you MUST have the app open on your phone. I don't love that, as I would think it should calculate it based off your phones location, but I'm no engineer.- Sleep Score & Cycle Tracker - I like to take a look at my sleep score over time, as I tend to not sleep a lot. I have a toddler and wake up at early hours each day to fit the needs of my family, and maintain my full time career. It helps me understand why I may be more tired on some days vs others. And each person needs a certain range of sleep, I try to stay within those parameters, but often my toddler disrupts my sleep cycles. It's been pretty accurate, any time I've tested it against what I have recorded manually. And I love the Cycle Tracker as a female. I have PCOS so my cycles have always wee bit wonky. This helps me track them, know when to expect them, and edit my information to have the most accurate account of each cycle. You can input your details about mood, flow, etc.With that said, I have noticed a few downfalls regarding this (and other) newer models: I go through about 1 a year. I am not the most kind to anything regarding accessories, so I understand I can be rough on them. But I do take care of my watch. I wash it, dry it, keep a screen protector on it. I don't shower with it, and charge it as often as I need. But I've had watches just stop working, the HR function quit, and all this within 1 year of purchase. Yes, Fitbit does have great customer service, and often without question they will send a replacement. However, I just feel like they're pushing out models constantly vs trying to really fix the problems.Like other reviewers, I've faced connectivity issues. Sometimes my watch just won't sync, then it won't record, and the app isn't updated. When exercising I've had the watch not pull GPS because it says it cannot connect, but I've done everything I can to troubleshoot. The Alexa function doesn't work for either of the two Versa 2's I've had. I've enabled it, and had it close to my phone; but it doesn't work.I really love the look of this Versa 2. With the one button on the side, to assist with maneuvering through the watch. I love the Customization features of this watch through the app, it's great. Fitbit really has something there, the app is so user friendly. However, I wish they would make a watch that lasted longer. And I know they're not Apple Watch price tags, but they're close enough. My MIL has the same problems as I, and she's not nearly as harsh on hers as I am. At this point, I'm looking into a different brand, just to see how I like it because my current Versa 2 (a replacement from the first one) is losing the seals around the bottom of the unit and I fear it will quit being water resistant.I would recommend this watch, absolutely. Especially for a beginner in this market, and for someone whom likes to track their daily movement. But maybe something a little more rugged for those that aren't so easy on our accessories."
35,Beatriz Valenzuela,4,the United States ,2-Dec-22,Great for tracking health patterns,"I really enjoy the simplicity of the design and how easy it is to use. I originally thought it was going to be complicated to use, but I was surprised to see that it wasn't. I've found it super helpful that it buzzes to remind me to take my hourly number of steps and it's so easy to keep track of my calorie and water intake, all in one!So far, I haven't had any major issues, the only issue that I've encountered is connecting my device to my Spotify Account. It's not that big of a deal for me, but I'm throwing that out there in case it is an important aspect for buyers."
36,Kindle Customer,4,the United States ,6-Nov-22,Glad to have a working Fitbit Versa 2 again.....,"The Fitbit Versa 2 that I have relied on for the past several years, bit the dust after the latest firmware update.  White lines, couldn't charge it, went on the fitbit community website and tried a couple of things that didn't work.  I read where the latest upgrade ""bricked"" the fitbit Versa 2, so I purchased a new one.  I am glad to have a working device but I believe Fitbit needs to do a better job of communicating issues and ways to correct the problems that occur.  But, in the grand scheme of things, they got a new purchase, which may or may not be what they are hoping for."
37,shan4606,4,the United States ,6-Dec-22,Not what I was hoping,"I was so excited to get this, and the Afib program on it never let me finish set up (went on fit bit community ,common problem) plus the 02 sensor and body temperature never even read the sensors....so I never knew.  Just disappointed"
38,Kelly,4,the United States ,8-Nov-22,Works like it should,"Not sure what the life span of this watch is, but for me it was about 3 years. Right before it stopped working, battery life was lasting about a day, vs 5 days. I liked it for steps and physical activity, which I felt were pretty accurate. I liked using it for sleep as well. When it worked it worked great, but was frustrating when it started dying. Overall, based on my personal experience, I would recommend."
39,Tori ,4,the United States ,25-Nov-22,Great!,I bought this for my mom and she loves it. She hasn't  has any issues with it and she wears it everyday.
40,Mels,5,the United States ,27-Nov-19,Versa 2 Comprehensive Review,"Love the watch.  The size is perfect.  The screen/resolution is crystal clear.  The selection of bands is great (though changing bands is a bit challenging).  The fabric band that comes with the Special Edition version is great.  Classes it up a fit.  Have also ordered a sport band to wear while playing soccer, swimming, etc.  The device includes nearly all desired features needed for a fitness/smart watch.  It does not have built-in GPS but rather uses connected GPS.  Some may see this as a deal breaker; others will recognize the battery savings that this affords.  And so far, the watch performance has been excellent.There are some reviews that describe Versa failure after getting it wet.  I have successfully showered with the watch with no problem.  I have not yet had a chance to try it in the pool.  Based on the specs it should be fine, but time will tell.  The Versa is not recommended to be worn in hot tubs.As Fitbit has long been a leader in activity tracking, I won’t spend time on those features.  Compared to the Samsung watch that I’ve worn … step counting, heart rate info, calories and sleep tracking all seem to be in line with my historical measurements.  A big benefit is that the Fitbit app is much more robust then the Samsung health app with significantly more data to analyze.The watch software and the battery consumption on both watch and linked phone need some attention.  I’m still trying to determine the optimal settings to achieve a balance of desired performance versus battery life.  With current settings, I can average about 3 days before needing to charge give or take a half day depending on usage.  I’m currently using the always on display which is nice.  It does consume some battery, but so far has not been too heavy of a drain to make the feature unusable.If you choose to use the music app to control music playing on the phone, then expect a massive battery hit.  This functionality requires linking an additional bluetooth connection called Fitbit classic.  It’s my experience that this connection continuously drains the battery on both the watch and the phone -- as much as 20% while sleeping.  That is with the watch in sleep mode and the phone on do not disturb.  I have removed this connection and will control music the old-fashioned way.  Note that this applies ONLY to playing music on the phone and not to connecting to bluetooth earphones.Another setting offered in the Fitbit app is “All-Day Sync.”  This feature constantly updates the data -- activity, heart rate, etc. -- from the watch to the phone.  Sounds good, but it also is a battery hog and I have it disabled.  As far as I know, syncing can be done one of two ways -- either via the all-day setting or manually when you open the app.  I’m currently choosing to update manually.  The developers need to add an option so the devices can be set to sync on a user-defined interval -- hourly, every six hours, daily, etc.  A setting like this exists for nearly every other phone app that requires data to be synced.  Weather apps are the first that come to mind.I am a Samsung user -- Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Buds (wireless earphones).  I can tell you that the Galaxy Buds will not work with the Versa 2 watch (as of 11/26/2019).  The Buds will link, but they will not play audio.  Something to do with different types of bluetooth used in the devices.  The issue is discussed in several online forums, but no word from Fitbit or Samsung if it will ever be addressed or fixed.  The watch does pair to the S10 without issue and works perfectly well.  All notifications are received timely and the bluetooth connection is much better/stronger than with my previous Samsung watch.  It easily stays connected at 30-40 feet.There are a couple of issues that need to be addressed related to phone notifications on the watch.  First, Gmail is the only client that is available as the ""default"" mail application.  Or, at least it is in my Fitbit app.  I can select to be notified by other email apps from my phone, but Gmail is the only app that can be set to receive ""special"" notification treatment according to the Fitbit app.  Secondly, alarms on the phone (and I use quite a few) are NOT available to notify on the Versa.  This feature would be a big plus to me.  You can set 8 alarms on the Versa.  However, each alarm uses some battery, and I would simply be duplicating alarms on multiple devices.  For example, I would not remove an alarm from my phone as I may need it while the watch is charging or not being worn.To correct other reviews that I've seen, music CAN be uploaded and stored on the watch.  The process requires using the desktop app and is a bit slow, but it works.  IF I had wireless headphones that connected properly, then I could play music direct from the Versa without the phone.One other small issue is that weather info does not exist on the clock face by default.  Third party clock faces can be installed, but I’ve found that they often require a separate setting for weather updates, which then only work if the All-Day Sync option is enabled.  I’m continuing to search for alternatives to see what options exist.There are quite a few apps available for download and use on the watch.  I haven't found any to be all that relevant or helpful to me.  At least not yet.  But the platform and functionality are there to use if desired.Also, I need to mention that the Alexa integration is great.  We have a heavy investment in Echo devices in our household, so to have the same functionality on my wrist is a great bonus.If, like me, you are apple averse, then this is one of the best smart watches available that I have found.  And very affordable.  At this point, I would rate it 8 out of 10.  And I would certainly increase that rating with continued additions to and improvement in the software, connectivity and watch features.**UPDATE 12/9/2019**Fitbit released a firmware update a few days ago which added some great features.  The Versa now saves your 5 most recently used clock faces and you can change them on the fly without having to go to the app.  Though there are tons of clock faces to choose from, one of the drawbacks with Fitbit is that you cannot flag, save or otherwise have access to your favorite faces.  You have to keep a manual list of the names or just remember so that you can find them again.  There needs to be a way to store a list of favorite faces and apps so that you can access and install them quickly.Other updates include that you can now customize the action of the side button, the sleep score is displayed on the watch, the list of exercises to choose from has expanded, and by reports the heart rate data has been improved.So I've learned that one of the tricks to manage battery life and connectivity is to restart the watch after making certain changes, such as switching to a new clock face.  You may notice that the Versa stops sending notifications or is not syncing to the app.  I've found that after a quick restart, the watch works perfectly again.  Maybe it's a software glitch, but at least there is an easy workaround.  And if you leave the watch alone, then these issues should not occur.For full functionality of the watch, including some features of many clock faces, I have re-enabled the All-Day Sync setting.  The watch and app perform much better with the setting enabled.  And unless I receive a ton of notifications or am constantly playing with the settings, I am now getting 4 to 5 days of battery life which is great.  This could also very well have something to do with the recent software update.  I am not currently using the always on display.  I estimate that AOD cuts the battery life by 30 to 50 percent.Also, before you make a decision with the help of reading these spectacular reviews, you might gauge the quality of the reviews.  This watch is by no means perfect and may not be the best choice for you, but you should decide that for yourself.  Then return it if you're not satisfied.  This is an electronic device and there can be duds.  Some buyers have expressed frustration after receiving a device that was dead on arrival.  Completely understandable.But there are many 1-star reviews that are not from a literate source.  A two word review that reads ""hate it"" is not helpful.  One review reads only ""no fitbit pay"" which is completely untrue.  The Versa absolutely has Fitbit Pay.  Also, I'm intrigued that apple phone users don't just pair their phone with an apple watch.  Not sure why they are shocked that the Versa does not work as seamlessly for them as a product designed by their phone maker.  Bottom line ... be your own judge.As referenced in my original review, I have updated my rating of the Versa 2 to a 9 out of 10, based on performance and recent software updates.  Hopefully my positive experience will continue."
41,Beercan79,5,the United States ,20-Oct-22,Exactly what I needed for phone notifications,"I purchased this smart watch 13 months ago. I had a Garmin VivoFit mainly for a pedometer and a watch. I was tired of missing calls, texts, and messages when my phone was not near or on me. I have loved getting most notifications from my phone, even in the next room. I can read and see them, but not answer, which is fine. Some app notifications are not available for FitBit, which is fine. I was mainly needing it for missed calls and messages. It has other basics synced with my phone like calendar (2 days out), calculator, weather. Can upload clock faces. Can add apps like games, which is kind of fun. I have my watch set so the time is constantly on, so I have to charge it every couple days, which is fine with me. I charge my phone daily, so it's not a huge deal to me. If I had the constant clock off, I could see it lasting more days between charges. I have had a bumper with a screen protector on the watch since opening the box, so the watch is still in great shape. The band is only now starting to show a little rubbing where the metal buckle sits. No other wear and tear on the band or watch. I sync it each morning to see my sleep report. You can set personal goals, like one of mine is 10,000 steps a day. The watch will give me a celebration each time I reach that goal. Other areas can have personal goals and tracking."
42,Jennifer Dreyer,5,the United States ,4-Nov-22,I'd be lost without my fitbit!,"I use it to check the time, date, day of the week, weather, and keep track of my steps, of course! I've had mine for over a year and it's till going strong. I change my display with my mood or the seasons. There are many free options as well as very reasonably priced options. My fit bit vibrates when I receive a call or text message so I never miss a call when I have to keep my phone on silent.  I got a different band from the one it came with.I bought my husband one and he got water on it the first week and it never worked again. So even though it says something about being waterproof, it's really not. Take it off before showering, swimming or doing dishes."
43,Cory L,5,the United States ,10-Apr-21,Great look and feel. User friendly. Perfect for a budget.,"Formalities: The watch was delivered on time, and in new condition. Box was sealed and no signs of damage. Now that all that jazz is out of the way.I used to wear a Samsung Gear watch to go with my phones, but I just couldn't pinpoint why I didn't care for them. It bugs me, but I just didn't like wearing those watches, so I switched to a FitBit.The FitBit Versa 2. I ordered the Grey wristband version and I really liked the light grey color of the silicone bands. However, like a few other people mentioned, the silicone bands weren't for me. I shower/clean myself daily and wash the wrist bands separately every morning before wearing. Even though I took precautions, I still developed a very itchy, open sore/rash. To fix this problem I ordered separate Grey wristbands right here from Amazon that are like a fabric texture ($13 for both small and large bands) that are 100 times easier to connect to the watch than the original bands by the way. No more rash, and they are extremely comfortable.Setup/App/Functionality:Setting up the watch is straightforward. Charge the watch. Download the app. Turn on watch. Follow prompts. Very easy to follow and very easy to connect watch to Wi-Fi.Functionality wise, this watch provides enough information. Steps. Heart rate. Obviously the time, etc. However, this watch does not have the ECG/EKG function. It has plenty of watch faces you can download, free or for a buck or two. Please note that some watch face creators actually have it where if you purchase a face and install, but want to change up to a new face and choose to go back to the one you just uninstalled, you will have to purchase that watch face AGAIN to re-install again if you want to go back to it. Pretty grimey, but it is what it is, I guess. Battery lasts about 2 days or so. It really depends on how you have your personal settings set up. Lastly, as I am sure everyone else that owns a smart watch has determined this, but if you are using the watch to gain exact measurements, heart rate, actual steps, I wouldn't go by this. My actual resting heart rate and what the watch displays are two totally different numbers, and the watch counts driving (turning the steering wheel) as steps. I use the numbers  from the watch as a baseline.The App:I have an S21 Ultra, so Android version of the App. I, personally, find the Android look of the app to be, well, just better looking than the iOS version. I have the Android phone, she has an iPhone. The layouts are slightly different, so it will just boil down to user preference. The App can prove difficult when trying to find some things, like attempting to change the time from standard to 24HR or military time. It requires taking a few different avenues, but once you figure it out, it's easy to remember.I already voiced my sort of gripes above with the watch face schemes, my personal experience with the silicone bands, and the accuracy of the steps and heart rate, but other than those things, this watch looks and feels great! I'm a larger man, and doing a pushup with my thick forearms, they don't press the single power button on the left side of the face over and over 🙃. For that, I am grateful.I cannot compare this to the other Fitbit watches. She has a Versa lite, which I feel has the same footprint as my Versa 2. Other than that, I like this watch. If you were considering this watch and it has been sitting in your list or cart for a while, go ahead and get it. Just remember the option for different material wristbands if the silicone bands give you trouble, or just preemptively purchase the other bands at the same time.Stay healthy my friends!"
44,Nancy,5,the United States ,4-Dec-22,I’m enjoying it.,I got confused by the stress measure.  I know that I was very stressed one day and it gave me a 94 which is supposed to be very good.  So clearly not measuring my actual stress.

46,Mary M,5,the United States ,5-Dec-22,Gave me notifications of irregular heart rate and advice to call doctor. Very accurate.,New versa 2 Fit Bit sent me notification and vibrations of irregular heart rate and to contact my physician. Highly recommend for tracking heart rate.
47,Susan Khoury,5,the United States ,16-Oct-22,Outstanding Smartwatch,"I bought this as a gift for my husband, whose recent diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes demands he exercise more and lose 50 lbs.  With Fitbit's recent firmware upgrades, it also now checks for heart rhythm abnormalities, important because he has heart issues.  He loves it!  He's on track to reach 10K steps a day and has dropped 14 lbs already.  The battery life is amazing: 6 days!  Compare that to my Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 that has to be recharged every day!  We counted his steps to see if it measured them accurately, and it does.  The app is very useful.  He appreciates the large display and the ease if swiping through his stats.  Highly recommend the Versa 2."

50,Noah Kaufman,1,the United States ,14-May-19,Complete Crap - Go Buy a Fitbit Instead,"I really wanted to like the Withings Steel HR since I dislike the clunky look of other fitness trackers such as the Fitbit Blaze and the Apple Watch. The product is attractively packaged, and seems well made until you try to pair the device with your Apple iPhone. The Steel HR features a single button where a regular watch has crown, which gives the device a classic look, and also makes the product a complete nightmare to interact with.The Steel HR features a ""Demo Mode"" for retailers to be able to show off features of the watch, however it is incredibly easy to put Steel HR into Demo Mode while trying to do a hard factory reset. And once the Steel HR is in ""Demo Mode', the process for getting it out is maddeningly difficult (and is different than what Withings provides in its documentation). After multiple phone calls to support, it was only by accident that I learned that you have to hold the crown until you see the words ""affichag sortie"" (which is French for 'exit display'), and then you must short press the button five times in rapid succession followed by a long button press.Attempting to pair the watch to my phone was a hopeless endeavor in frustration. My experience was that I could get the Steel HR through the initial part of the pairing process. My phone would successfully connect via Bluetooth, but after connecting the Withings app insists on attempting to update the Steel HR to the latest firmware -- which inevitably FAILS. After the failure to update, the Steel HR then becomes unresponsive and must be 'factory reset', upon which the same thing will happen again, and again, and again.For me the update always failed at the 15% percent mark. At one point after failing to update, rather than resetting the Steel HR, I retried the update which then got up to 68% percent before failing again -- forcing another factory reset.This could be a great product but unfortunately the software is complete rubbish; the fact that the user has no way to set up the Steel HR without updating the unit first is really, really, really DUMB design decision since one bad software update and you are unable to use the product.I'm disappointed and returning mine to Amazon for a full refund and going back to using my Fitbit. Although the Fitbit looks terrible, at least it works."
51,K,1,the United States ,1-Jan-19,Lovely Watch. Horrible Company Philosophy.,"I've had this watch for a few weeks now. I love the hardware for this watch (except for the very weak vibration motor). The company philosophy behind it makes my skin crawl. Would not recommend.My first step after opening the box was to figure out how to set the time. Ok. The ""manual"" just says to get the app. Ok. The app says to make and account with Withings. Strange but not completely out of the ordinary these days. Account setup with Withings says that it will send all collected data back to Withings and you CANNOT OPT OUT. So, there I was with a dilemma- Make an account that will pass all my information (GPS location, Heart Rate, Steps, Sleep Patterns, Contacts, and Notifications) back to some company, or return my new watch because it WON'T LET ME SET THE TIME.So in case you couldn't tell- I bit the bullet and made the account, got the app, set the time and tried to do so with the least amount of ""Allow Withings to send you promotional information"" that I could, and I still received promotional emails. One was an ad for a sleep study (for sleep apnea) because the app can't track sleep very well, one to their Black Friday sale which had my watch for 30% off as the first item (thanks!), and most were other targeted advertisements based on the information I'd given them in the account setup. Since then I've found the hidden opt-out options and these have stopped for now.I just wanted a watch that could look nice, let me know when I had a new notification, and could give me a vibration alarm. I really didn't care about the fitness side of this watch. I didn't want to buy into some kind of data harvesting lifestyle. A simple stand alone app would have made me a happy customer, but now I'm just full of sadness and mistrust every time I look at my watch."
52,byrdshadow,1,the United States ,26-Apr-20,An Expensive Mistake,"I have had this watch since the last week in February when I bought it just prior to having a pacemaker installed. I needed a device that could help me keep track of heart rate as I engaged in daily activities and working out.  I opted for this one because of the stylish design.  With the exception of the almost unreadable analog time face, I was very pleased with it and, at Withings request, left a very positive review.  However, 6 days ago I placed the watch in its charging station and it absolutely refused to charge.  There were some limited suggestions on their support site which I tried to no avail.  Meanwhile, my battery was slowly draining.  I contacted customer support three days ago and expressed urgency given the medical need for the data and the battery draining.  After 24 hours passed I sent a second request via the support site and then a third via email.  There is still no response.  I am done with this and have ordered an Apple Watch 5.  I suggest if you're serious about this you do the same...no need to waste $200 on this like I did.  Withings is touting a new version, awaiting FDA approval, that can also collect electrocardiogram data. I hope the FDA doesn't approve because this will make them even more dangerous should the watch fail."
53,Jack Harvey,1,the United States ,19-Aug-20,A watch I really wanted to like,"Think of the Withings HR as that supermodel (gender of your choice) about whom you had fantasies of a relationship. Great looking, fantastic specs, good price point. But, then, reality set in...I actually tried 2 of these watches. The first arrived stuck in Demo mode and all the tech support in the world couldn't un-stick it. Couldn't sync it with the Health Mates app or install updates. Amazon was great about taking a return and quickly supplying a 2nd watch.Watch #2 actually paired with the Health Mates app (improvement over watch #1), but the software updates would never install past 7%. So again, the watch wasn'te usable. Thanks to Amazon, again, for taking a return and giving a refund.Withings customer support was slow to respond and only offered snips of instructions from their website that I'd already followed. Amazon tech support (new experience for me) was quick and responsive, offered snips of instructions off the Withings website, and provided no resistance to arranging a return.I don't recommend buying a Withings watch. I'm moving on to a different brand. If you do get sucked into the supermodel fantasy (we all do...), buy from Amazon and not direct from Withings. At least you can easily return the watch when it doesn't work."
54,Josue R,1,the United States ,25-May-18,First the Pros 1) It's a beautiful simple watch,"I think it should be fair that going from a Fitbit Charge HR to the Steel HR at twice the price should provide twice the benefits.First the Pros1) It's a beautiful simple watch.2) Easy to setup3) Comfortable4) Cool visible 0%-100% step goal dialThe cons1) Continuous HR is only manually activated by going into activity mode, which can be left on indefinitely if desired, but takes the battery life down to 3-4 days.2) Once in Continuous mode, only HR and timer are select-able by pressing the side button. you can't see your steps, distance, calories or battery levels can be seen. none of that3) I don't think it has a floor counter like the fitbit, not a huge turn off, but maybe for some.4) No HR live view on your phone only average.5) The included band can make you sweat a bit.This watch could get a 5 Star if they advertised it as 25 Days Average/5 Days continuous HR. with a mode that always has HR always on but will let you cycle through your steps, distance and calories. I'm sure they could do it with an app update and firmware as well.That's the other thing that's missing, live stats on your phone, HR and steps as you take them getting updated on your phone screen like the fitbit.May return it and the the Garmin Vivomove HR for $20 more or go back to a Fitbit"
55,tfmal,1,the United States ,25-Jan-18,Can't read the time!!!,"OK, so when I read the reviews, at least one person complained about not being able to see the hands but I did not think it would be that bad judging by the pics you see online. Well guess what..... 9 out of 10 times I looked at this watch I struggled to see the time.Now, if you have a white watch, you are probably OK, I assume. I think this is most likely an issue with the black face watches. Unfortunately the larger size only come in black - BIG STUPID MISTAKE by Nokia. I would have swapped my watch for a white one but its only available in the small size which is way too small for me and many people Im sure.So, the problem is the silver metal hands. They just blend right into the black face under most conditions. If you turn it just right, the light will reflect and look fantastic and easy to read, but you have to keep slowly turning your arm for several seconds and to me this is just silly. A watch first has to be just that.....a watch. You should be able to quickly see the time.Also, on day 2, I stopped receiving notifications even though it said my watch was connected.I really wanted to love this watch. It is just what I thought I wanted, but with major flaws I returned on 2nd day."
56,nancywonderland,1,the United States ,30-Jul-19,"Very very pretty, but that’s it...","Oh how I wanted to love this product so so bad. Unfortunately, I had to part ways and return my Steel HR with a much heavy heart. Physically, the look and feel of this watch is solid and so so pretty a 5/5 hands down . The first day I wore it I got oh so many compliments. Sadly, very quickly, I realized this is where Withings’ strength lies in its beauty, because what is under the “hood” was an entirely different story. I must disclose I have been a Fitbit user for about 4 years now, if you too are a Fitbit user contemplating switching to Withings please expect to be highly disappointed as step tracking is very very far from being at the level and accuracy that Fitbit offers. In fact, I wore both simultaneously and experienced anywhere from 500-1500 step difference. I didn’t want this to be the case and continued to wear it for a week in hopes that at some point the difference would not be so great, but sadly, it remained the case. Thus, forcing me to return it. I hope that Withings can perfect their algorithm so that it is more exact in tracking accuracy of steps, because it is such a pretty product! Withings, I hope you are reading this :)"
57,Cam,1,the United States ,3-Jul-19,Doesn't sync well. Terrible customer service,"I am so incredibly disappointed with this watch and the customer service behind it. I purchased the watch about three months ago and started having syncing issues (it would not reliably connect for incoming messages, calls, etc). Customer service ran me through all sorts of tests, which took hours. It didn't solve the problem and I kept calling them. They told me not to return it or exchange it, they were ""updating software"" or ""just finishing a new part of the application"" so I should hang tight. Finally, the watch stopped altogether- no syncing, incorrect time, and wouldn't hold a charge. Instead of replacing it and working with their customers, Withings put me through days worth of back and forth. Constant ""delete this app and try these 6 steps"" - they even had me go find another phone to try to connect it with...to no avail. I finally had it when I repeatedly asked them to just replace/return the item for the 10tj time and they then asked me to take a video of me doing the entire reboot process.Thank you to Amazon, who despite it being over 30 days, heard about my situation and felt bad that as a consumer Withings did not hold up their end. So I was able to return this nightmare of a product for a partial refund."
58,j xu,1,the United States ,18-Jan-19,"I got very unlucky, amazon was great help","I would not give this any stars if it wasn't for amazon's customer service.I needed to replace my broken fitbit charge 2.What caught my eyes was the battery life for this watch, not having to charge it for 20+ days would be nice for a smartwatch. So I made the purchase.Two days later, i got the watch, But it would not charge no matter what I tried. So i called amazon customer service, the representative ask me to purchase a new charger at no cost to see if it is a charger issue and i did.Two days later, the charger came, as I suspected, it was not a charger problem as the new charger does not charge as well. so i got myself a defective watch, this is the first time i got a defective product from amazon, so I was very disappointed at the brand/manufacturer. I have decided to go with another brand instead of nokia/withings.While the watch would not charge, i used it for a couple of days with the power that the watch came with, it was comfortable, measures steps, heart rate and sleep well. I was just unlucky that I ended up with a defective unit.amazon was amazing at helping me fix the issues, thanks Amazon!"
59,Cady,1,the United States ,12-Jan-20,So disappointed by sleep tracker!,"As someone with CFS/ME, I struggle to wake up more than the average person.  I did research to find a tracker with a smart-alarm to try to help me wake up easier and less groggy during lighter periods of sleep.  I was so excited when I ordered this watch.  When it arrived, it was beautiful! The first night, it seemed to work great....I think the smart alarm did work the first morning.  After that, though, the sleep tracking has been a nightmare SMDH.  First, be aware that it does not track naps...which is apparently intentional, but a terrible idea...especially when the watch doesn't even know what a nap is.  If you wake up for too long during the night, it will stop tracking your sleep...and the amount of time you have to be awake for this to happen is extremely inconsistent.  If you have a child who wakes you up on occasion as I do, don't waste your time or money on this garbage.  And, the moment that it's decided that it doesn't need to track your sleep anymore, the alarm no longer goes off.  IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD SLEEP TRACKER, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS beautiful piece of garbage."
60,Kindle Customer,2,the United States ,5-Jan-18,Thewatch looks nice,"The watch looks nice.  It looks just like a regular watch. The analog step tracker is a nice touch, I think. Cycling through the differnet screens is slow and clunky as others have noted. The wrist band is comfortable and easy to clean.NotificationsThe watch only gives notifications for calls, text messages, emails, and calendar appointments. I use the Outlook app on my Android phone for email and calendar, and I never once got a notification for either. Only texts and calls work. text notification don't show the text for sms messages, unfortunately. It only shows who it's from.Sleep trackingSleep tracking is not good. It always shows that I went to sleep at least 2 hours before I actually do. It even shows me as awake during most of these 2 hours, but still considers it part of my 'sleep'. There is not way to edit the sleep sessions in the app or on the website.AlarmI set an alarm for 6 AM Mon-Fri. But the alarm goes off at around 5 AM every morning. I thought I could outsmart it by setting the alarm for 7 AM, but then it just went off at 5:30. I have a feeling this has something to do with Daylight Saving time, but there watch and my phone show the corect time. Because it's a 'smart' alarm it picks what time to actually wake up up. I haven't found any way to disable this.Step trackingStep counts show about half of what my previous fitness tracker showed. I'm not certain which was more accurate.Activity TrackingActivity tracking is very inconsistent. I did the same exact workout every morning.  The same 30 minute Elliptical program, followed by 20 pushups and 20 situps. I activated the 'workout' mode every day before the workout, and de-activated it immediately afterwards. Here are the results:Day 1: Android app shows 8 minutes of swimming. I try to change the activity type to Elliptical and the duration to be 30 minutes, but the app tells me that there is already another activity during that time, though it doesn't show any.  I go to the Nokia Health website, which lists the 8 minute swimming activity, but also an 11 minute walking activity that overlaps the swimming time by 2 minutes.  I delete the second activity, and change the swimming activity duration to 30 minutes.  The website automatically adjusts the kcals for the activity.  Back on the Android app, the activity type and duration are updated biut the kcals never do.Day 2: Android app shows 34 minute activity. All I have to do is change the type to Elliptical.Day 3: Android App show no activity. The website does show an activity, though I have to change the type and duration.Day 4: App shows 33 minute activity and asks me to specify the type.  I update it, but then the app shows the updated activity, and the original activity.  Same time and duration on both.  I have to delete the second activity to make it go away.Day 5: App shows 38 minute activity, website shows 17 minute activity. I hade done my morning workout, then 10 minutes later went outside to shovel the driveway.  Both the app and website start their activity about half way through my workout. I update the start time and the duration of the website activity, but it never changes on the Android App.Day 6: Android app shows no activity. Website shows 17 minute activity that starts about 10 minutes after my actual workout. I edit the website activity, but it never shows in the app.Workout modeI'm not sure what the purpose of the 'Workout mode' is. You would think that it would automatically log the activity whenever you activiate it, but that doesn't seem to be accurate. So, if not for that, then maybe it's just to help you keep track of things like heart rate, distance, calories, sn time.  It shows heart rate and distance, but distance is so small it's difficult to read. The screen doesn't stay on in this mode either, like other fitness trackers so you cant just look down at your wrist to see the heart rate, you have to actually push the button everytime to turn the screen on."
61,IMRAN QUADRI SYED,2,the United States ,23-Nov-22,The watch Is beautiful but it can't count the steps correctly,"I like the watch. It is beautiful but the problem is with step counting and not being able to turn off bluetooth on watch. These 2 things are a big problem for me. I would have returned the watch but keeping it for wearing it in parties. But for regular day I will wear my Garmin watch which is much accurate with steps.I checked the step count by manually counting steps and comparing against my Garmin, apple watches. Withings watch counts about 25% less steps."
62,Blaise Hartley,2,the United States ,15-Jul-18,"Beautiful concept, disappointing implementation...","Having lived with a first-gen smartwatch for several years, I knew exactly what I wanted and this watch seemed to fit the bill.  It’s a sleek, beautiful watch with physical analog hands and an uncomplicated face, but still provides notifications, a fitness tracker, and alarms. It even has a fancy feature called ‘smart wakeup’ that lets you pick a wakeup window, rather than time, and wakes you at your lightest sleep cycle during that window.Having used the watch for a week, I was devastated to be forced to send it back for a refund. It is surely a beautiful watch, but fails in virtually every other way. Other than the appearance, I was looking for three features:1) An analog watch that worked well and looked and felt like a real watch on my wrist2) Notifications from my phone, so I would be made aware when messages or appointments came up3)That super-cool smart wakeup featureWhat I found:1) The watchface, while delicate and beautiful in good lighting, has vanishingly thin hands that are utterly unreadable in anything less. Not only that, it has no backlight you can activate, so it’s effectively unreadable a lot of the time. Now, you might think, as I initially did, that since it has a screen that can show the time, I could use a gesture control to turn the screen on as needed, but you (and I) would be wrong. The screen can only be activated by pushing the stem/button. This means that unless you are outside in daylight or in a well lit room, if you want to know what time it is, you need two hands!2) The notifications on the watch suffer from several defects. First of all, the power of the notification vibration is so low, you basically never feel it unless you happen to be very still in a very quiet room. Second, while the notifications *do* inform you of calls, calendar events, and messages, the only calendar it will use is the stock google calendar, ignoring all others. Third, literally the ONLY messages you get notifications for are SMS messages, and even then, only if you are using the stock text-messaging app. No WhatsApp, no Signal, no Facebook Messenger, no Google Hangouts, nothing. Effectively, this watch is utterly useless at the single most important function a smartwatch can provide!3) The smart wakeup feature depends upon the watch’s alarm. They aren’t joking about the “Alarm” part, either. There is literally only one alarm on the watch. You can’t even set different wakeup times for weekends! Over and above this, during the course of a week, the “smart” wakeup woke me every single day at the earliest possible point in my wakeup window. Yet again, useless in every possible way…I wanted to love the Steel. I *still* want to love it. It’s beautiful and elegant, and is billed with great features. It just doesn’t HAVE those features yet…"
63,informaticist,2,the United States ,26-Sep-21,Only if you don't care about calorie tracking,"I'm returning ths to Amazon and going back to Fitbits, which I'm very sad about because all my Fitbits have died after 18 months, and there are some things I really like about this. watch.  But the most important feature that I use in a fitness tracker watch is calorie tracking during workouts. I""ve lost some weight because I track my caloric intake and I track my caloric burn while exercising to reach my daily balance goal.  Withings does not assess caloric burn in any way that is useful or reliable.  It is not based on actual effort, e.g. HR (despite the name of the watch...).  In the week I've had it, I've seen too many useless calorie measurements.  Also, you can't check the calories burned while working out, so you can't walk/cycle/etc. until you've reached your goal for the workout (even if their calorie burn calculations were actually accurate).Other negatives: the sleep tracking is okay, but definitely simplistic compared to Fitbit. The digital readout is really, really small.  The watch hands are virtually unreadable without twisting your wrist to get the light at the right angle, at least for the black version.On the plus side, it looks nice, the band is very comfortable compared to Apple Watch or Fitbit, the app is simple to use, and battery usage after a week has so far tracked with their promise of 20+ days per charge.If Withings would incorporate heart rate into caloric burn, show calories burned while working out, and increase the width of the watch hands just a bit to make them more visible, this would be amazing.  But alas."
64,Sus,2,the United States ,20-Jun-22,Expensive disposable watch,"I loved this watch so much that when my first one broke after 2 years I immediately purchased another. That second purchase was in 2020 and this spring when the clocks were set forward the digital time corrected but the hands did not. They will not fix the watch because it is out of warranty so here is a second watch dead in 2 years, actually less than 2 years. The app has also done crazy things and often shows me dashboards from previous watches that have long been deleted from 2015. When it works the watch is super cool especially for tracking sleep and keeping you informed throughout the day. However the app is wonky and the watch will only last you 2 years pretty expensive for $175 watch. Unfortunately my advice is not to buy."
65,Andrea D.,2,the United States ,11-Apr-20,5 stars for style. 2 stars for actual step tracking,"5 stars for style. 2 stars for actual step tracking.If you've read other reviews, you've probably seen that Withings products record fewer steps than other trackers. I've been in touch with them on this issue and worked through potential troubleshooting.  I understand their goal is to have the most accurate tracker that doesn't pick up false steps from other activities.  Fair, but in their pursuit of that goal, they've created an incredibly inaccurate step count for many people.I just spent 2 hours working around my house this morning,  and it recorded a whopping 52 steps...in 2 hours.  This is my main issue.  I could deal with a reduced step count on average and just adjust my expectations-- if I only had steps each day that were outdoor steps on hard pavement.  Any walking indoors, especially without shoes or on carpet, barely registers at all.  There's no relative consistency if you have differing activities by day.Withings needs to relax their goal of a perfect tracker for one type of steps.  There should be a tolerance level so that users can test with their own steps.  I'm going to have to hang with this tracker for now, but I wouldn't purchase another Withings at this point until I'd be sure I can get a relatively accurate basic pedometer function along with the otherwise very well designed piece.I consistently receive compliments on this price and would love to be able to recommend it.  Please update your product, and I'll be an avid promoter for it!"
66,Boyce B.,2,the United States ,1-Jun-18,"Great, elegant looking watch. But time is the only thing it really does well.","Great, elegant looking watch. But time is the only thing it really does well. I really wanted to like this watch, but as a fitness tracker, the data it collects is mostly fiction. I used it for three weeks. I shudder to think Nokia is using the data to research the health of their customers. Garbage in, garbage out.The calories burned is way off, too low.  An earlier reviewer said she contacted Nokia and was told it did not use heartrate to calculate calories. I didn't see that review before I bought this. What is the point of tracking heartrate if it's not used in calorie calculations?It sort of tracks the low and peak heartrate for each half hour, but not very well. It's almost like they think people only work out for a half hour. Most of the time it does not sense a hard workout, or cuts out after about a half hour.  It will track longer if you manually tell it you are working out, but even then not for 90 minutes. The calorie count is too low, and the heartrate graph does not have actual heartrates. And the graph does not match the one from my cheststrap. My cheststrap and the elliptical machine say I burned 400+ calories, and the watch says I burned 58.The sleep tracking is wildly erratic at sensing the start of sleep. It thinks I'm sleeping when lounging around watching videos at 1900. There's no way to edit this to my actual bedtime. It does a good job of sensing wakeukp time. Because it includes awake time in the resting heart rate, that rate is high.I think the problems are mostly software. Looks to me like they added heartrate tracking to an earlier watch and didn't put much effort into integrating  the heartrate information to track fitness. I really wanted to like this watch. I would try the next generation of this watch, or give this generation another try if they made a big claim of upgrading the software. Meanwhile returning this one to Amazon for a refund."
67,Victoria,2,the United States ,28-Jul-22,time,"I don't recommend this watch as it doesn't keep time.  I do use this watch for knowing the accurate time.  I've had to reset it 3-4 times since owning it for a month or so.  I would think it would remain synced with the phone and I would expect a watch to keep accurate time.I would return if I could; however, it appears my return time has expired.  Not satisfied."
68,Ryan,2,the United States ,26-Jan-18,Only get this if you care more about looks than tracking,"The watch is gorgeous. I'd say it is definitely better looking (IMHO) than any other fitness tracker out there. However, that's about all that it has going for it.Pros:-Looks-SizeCons:-Inaccurate step tracker. I used an elliptical on two days. The first I did it normally, the second I exaggerated my arm swing. On the first day the number of steps looked woefully small, only about seven hundred. On the second day it looked more accurate. So if you don't swing your arms quite a bit, it's not going to catch it.-Sleep tracker inaccurate to the point of uselessness. I didn't go to bed until eleven. The tracker had me asleep at 530 because I was working on my computer. I'm not able edit the time in the app (at least as far as I know).-Wonky manual activity tracking. I was using the aforementioned elliptical when I turned on manual activity tracking and turned it off after I was done. It did not get uploaded to the app so I had to manual input it (even though it was saying there was something already during that time...even though there was not).-Not as advertised battery life. I charged it yesterday afternoon to 100% and this morning, before I went to the gym, it was at 90%. I'm not seeing how it's going to last another 25 days.-The app is missing a lot of tracking features. When Nokia bought Withings, they changed the app. They really should've left it alone, as the previous app was better in every way possible.-Lack of partner apps. You better hope you like Myfitnesspal, because if you want to track calories with the watch  and show remaining, that's the only app that you can work with.I like the watch as a watch, but I needed a tracker as well. I'm honestly not sure if it's worth the plethora of issue. I'm probably going to return this."
69,Jimloco,2,the United States ,3-Jun-20,"Expensive for a disposable watch. Battery lasted for 11 months, Nokia didn't honor their warranty.","I bought this watch before Christmas of 2018 to give as a present to my wife. She started using it Christmas day. In November the battery would intermittently not take a charge. I used Nokia's knowledge base, and chalked it up to firmware because each time there was a firmware update it would start charging again. In January 2020, it died for good. I was in the beginning process of looking to return it to Nokia and COVID-19 hit. Fast forward to two weeks ago, and I finally have a chance to start this process again, and understandably it takes two weeks for Nokia to respond.This is the response ....----I sincerely apologize for the delayed response. Due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), our support centers are currently operating in a reduced capacity. As such, please expect a delay in our responses to your support requests.Upon checking your proof of purchase, your Steel HR is already outside of the one-year warranty period. Although this is not covered under warranty, you are eligible for a 25% coupon to use towards a replacement product.---So now I have a $189 paperweight. Given the warranty is only 1 year, and I can find no instructions on youtube, etc on how to replace the battery or what components to buy, this watch instantly becomes disposable. It's unfortunate too because it's a really nice looking watch."
70,TJG,3,the United States ,2-Jul-19,Nice looking watch but the step tracking leaves a lot to be desired,"Bought this watch a few months ago as my first ""smart watch"".  I am a traditionalist and don't like the looks of a lot of the new smart watches.  They are either square, huge and bulky, or cost a small fortune.  I was basically looking for a watch that looked like a regular watch and had smart features.  This is where the Withings HR shines, but there are a few drawbacks which I will outline below.Looks:  Traditional round face and with the exception of the small round circle under 12 o-clock you wouldn't know it wasn't just a regular watch.  The size is perfect and should fit both large and small wrists without looking out of place.  The rubberized strap is minimal and even though it's not leather I don't think it would look out of place in a business casual or even business setting.Comfort:  The watch is comfortable.  I have been wearing it 24/7 since I bought it a few months ago without issue.  The band doesn't seem to make me sweat or collect gunk.  I normally just wipe it down after I charge it and every few days in between charges.  I noticed a small bit of chaffing after I slept for the first week or so, but after I found the correct tightness for the band it went away completely.Function:  Here is where things start to break down a bit.  First, please note that this is a HYBRID smartwatch.  If you don't know what the difference is, I'd highly recommend doing some research before you purchase.  I knew what I was getting into when I bought it so I was fine with the tradeoffs.  Battery life is amazing.  I charge this thing maybe once a month and it usually takes between 1-2 hrs for a full charge.  The heart rate function seems accurate enough.  I don't think I'd trust it as a medical device and it does get a little wonky if you are really pushing yourself, but the average user should be fine.  The step counting is the biggest let down for me.  I knew coming from a FitBit which seems to overestimate your steps that my daily step count was going to drop.  Well it did.  I went from around 3000 steps on a lazy day to about 700 steps.  I don't care how much fitbit overestimates it's steps, something is wrong if you go down that much just by changing devices. I tried a small test where I manually counted my steps and walked around my house for a couple of minutes and it seemed like it was picking up 1 step for every 10 actual steps I took.  I contacted support and just got a normal ""how do you know that you didn't really only take 700 steps"" response.  It was rather insulting given that I spelled out the test I did in the email.  I do notice that if I walk outside the house it is a little more accurate so maybe their algorithm is tied to the GPS in some way, but if you work from home or pace a lot, don't count on getting credit for those steps.  The rest of the features seem to work fine.  I get notifications when somebody texts me and as long as the message isn't too long I can read it on my wrist which is coolOverall, this is a nice looking hybrid smart watch with some basic features.  If you want a watch to help keep you notified of your calls and texts this watch is fine.  If you are looking for a fitness tracker stay with fitbit or pay the extra cash for a higher end product.  I'll be hanging on to this until the smatch watch ecosystem matures a bit more and then upgrading to something more accurate."
71,SimSim,3,the United States ,21-Sep-19,"I love it, but it has flaws.","The watch looks nice on; I've received many compliments. However there are things to mention.1. Inside seal: There's a single strand of a fuzz on the inside of my watch which drives me nuts bc it's a white fuzz and always makes its way back to the black screen.2. Metal and glass quality: I have watches I've worn for 8 years as a teacher, and let me tell you...I beat the hell out of them! Yet this watch, after owning for less than 3 weeks, already has scratches all over the metal, and even a scratch on the glass.3. Comfort: I find the watch comfortable to wear throughout the day; however, I've found myself waking up at night due to the discomfort of the watch. Idk if it's because I'm pregnant and my arm is swelling at night, but this is disappointing bc the main reason I bought this watch was to track my sleep (or lack thereof). Also, once I wake up at like 330am and go back to  sleep and wake up like 3 or 4 more times before 730, it doesn't track the sleep bc you have to be asleep for like 3 hrs straight before it tracks again.Step accuracy: seems accurate. My husband was concerned that his wasn't accurate bc we were both walking nearly the same distances while visiting Disney parks for a week and my steps were way higher than his, I'm talking like 3 or 4,000 steps more. We switched watches one day and turns out his watch was fine, it just wasn't tracking a lot of his steps bc he was pushing the stroller and not moving his arm enough. Also, after checking, steps weren't tracked whenever I was walking while carrying our child.My husband really loved this watch but he couldn't see it as a worth while purchase due to how easily it scratches. He also was having an allergic reaction to the band.Me on the other hand, although disappointed in a few aspects of the watch like the fuzz in the face, and how fragile it is, I've grown attached to this damn thing and love it as an every day casual watch. I bought a bright yellow silicon band from Archer watch straps on Amazon and it is cheery looking. The band is insanely comfy and smooth; I like it more than the band it came with originally."
72,Zulma,3,the United States ,2-Jul-21,Inaccurate pedometer,"I can't believe how hard it has been to find a simple watch that looks nice and measures my steps accurately. Apparently that is too much to ask. I've had this watch for one day. I know that's very little time, but I already know the pedometer is terrible. I wore my regular clip on pedometer yesterday and the watch. My clip on is very accurate as I can see the steps go up with each step I take and every test I've done where I count and use the pedometer it measures my steps very accurately. Yesterday the watch was behind on my pedometer by almost 1000 steps. It does not count steps when the screen is lit and when I walk and count to see how the step tracking is doing it is often off by 5-10 steps ( I would only count between 10-30 steps at a time). Another thing I don't like is that I can't turn off bluetooth from the watch. But I was willing to ignore that if it was accurate at step counting.Otherwise I really like the watch. I like the design, the simplicity, comfort, the small digital screen, and the fact that it doesn't look like a smartwach. I will continue to wear it for a few more weeks to see if it improves and update my review if it does. Otherwise I will sadly be returning it. Next I'm trying a casio step tracking watch. If that doesn't work I guess I'll have to stick to my clip on, which is just very impractical to have to remember to actually clip it on and find ways to hide it."
73,Arda A.,3,the United States ,19-Mar-18,I have been using Steel HR and i liked it very much but have to list its cons ...,"UPDATED:Sorry to write this but the watch is too vurnurable to scratches. I have mine scratched with a touch not noticable to me at all. Now i have to use mine like this because of the warranty rules—————————————————have been using Steel HR and i liked it very much but have to list its cons too:)Here goes my pros/cons review:Pros:-The watch looks amazing and probably the best looking watch with tracking abilities but the 36mm version can be a little bit bigger like 40 or 42 for the men- Step tracking is pretty much accurate and had similar readings with my moto 360- Sleep tracking gets the awake hours and the total time correctly but the pulse may be a little bit off during the sleep- Continuous activity tracking seems to work well- 36mm version is pretty light and easy to wear during the day. The only problem as i mention in cons is silicon wristband.- No connection issues so far. Its very satisfying as i had many issues with my android watch.- Charger is not the best but it does its job.Cons:- Watchband does not fit the beauty of this watch, it looks and feels like cheap silicon- 10min for regular pulse readings is way to long to give the correct readings for instant heart pumping activities during the day.- Its hard to display readings from the watch as its reuired fot you to push side button. It will be much better if it displays the info with wrist motion like in android watches.- Only specific apps has notifications on watchface like calls,sms, calendar etc()no whatsapp so far)- Health Mate app is the real problem here.  -It can only import 2 weeks of data from Apple health and its discouraging to see that you are not able to consolidate your 2 years of readings in a single app(maybe its apple's limitation)  -No HR sleep average for week and month intervals and i guess no year display for any stats,  -No barchart graphics for longer periods. Only the colored circles indicating you surpass your goal or you're short of it.  -No setting to devrease or increase the time interval of readings(10min by default)  -Not enough meaningful program to join in app with the steel-hr(only sleeep better)  -For now not enough data comparison and smart analysis from the previous readings. Only the ones for badges, goals and programs."
74,Amazon Customer,3,the United States ,25-Feb-22,Notifications functionality does not work well with iPhone IOS,"The watch firmware does not appear to refresh its connection with my iPhone 12 when I am not in motion. Therefore, I am not notified on my Steel HR when I receive an email, text, etc. while I am sitting at my desk working unless I regularly access the Health Mate app and search for the device. I have contacted Withings on numerous occasions and they do not seem to have a solution.Other than the above, the watch is attractive, has great battery life and seems to be a very accurate activity and HR tracker. So if you do not care about receiving notification alerts it is a good product for the money."
75,jhemp,3,the United States ,5-Aug-18,Fell Short,"I really wanted to like this watch.  It had 2 main shortcomings that led to me returning it and going for my old faithful Fitbit.  If you're coming from a Fitbit, these same issues may be a major factor in your decision.My Fitbit Charge 2 died out of warranty so it was time to get something new.  I researched and came across this watch and the battery life had me intrigued.  It's phenomenal.  With that, you don't get as accurate and consistent of a heart rate reading as a Fitbit throughout the day, but in exercise mod it can perform same as a Ftbit.  The shortcomings for me were that it didn't show your resting heart rate in the Health Mate app nor REM sleep patterns.  These two metrics are ones that I really like to keep an eye on.  Maybe the watch can't accurately calculate them, or maybe it's the software.  Either way, that was my main reason for returning and going for a Fitbit Versa.  I would have been willing to deal with the Health Mate app which is meh compared to Fitbit's.  I'll wait and see what they do with the next version.  Another issue, but not a dealbreaker was that the watch needed some glow in the dark paint somewhere on the hands and minute markers.  I realize that takes away from the sleekness, but it made it impossible to read in low light and you're forced to have to hit the button for the digital time. Hopefully this is addressed as well.Overall, if I had the extra money I would have kept this to use for times I need a classy watch.  But for an everyday wearable, it just fell short for what I wanted it to do."
76,NotHappy,3,the United States ,29-Apr-22,Steps counter is highly inaccurate,"Good building quality, app is nice but not as good as the Samsung health one and there is no way to transfer steps to samsung health. The steps counter is highly inaccurate, and about 50/60% of what fitbit, samsung is measuring. Do not buy if steps accuracy is important"
77,daisy_miller,3,the United States ,3-Jan-20,Does the tasks I require—almost.,"I really like how this watch looks. The design is clean and modern. The band is very comfortable. Watch is easy to operate with the app. The battery life is terrific. This is important to me.What I don’t like: the limited apps that this watch works with in displaying notifications. I use Google Voice and Spark email and I can’t get notifications for any of my Spark accounts, nor with Voice. Not good.The design of the face could use a little tweaking. Without my glasses on it’s hard to read the hands of the analog clock. A red accent color to define the hands (as on the Steel HR Sport) would differentiate them from the steps dial in low light, and would be ideal. It would also look sharp. The OLED Notifications display does not have a brightness adjustment. It’s too bright for me.I’m not sure if I’ll keep this watch or return it. If it was able to send me notifications in more apps, it would do exactly what I need it to do. No more nor less.I would have chosen the Sport if it did not have a black-only case. The hands are ideally readable."
78,Lindsey,3,the United States ,31-May-20,Classic Look with some concerns,"I spent a lot of time looking for this watch. I wanted something that looked classic that could track my steps and this hit the mark! I get a ton of compliments on it and people are always impressed by what all it does. I also love the battery life as I can do weeks without charging it.While I love the watch - it is not durable. I wish I would have listened and bought a screen protector because now it’s scratched and there’s not much I can do now. Additionally while the watch was initially comfortable, my skin has a reaction to wearing the watch. I can no longer wear it at night without breaking out in bumps and I try to avoid wearing it all day - taking it off mid day to give my skin a break. I regularly clean the watch but something about it doesn’t jive with me.The app is pretty intuitive but glitchy. It takes time for it to download information and is prone to crashing."
79,KS,3,the United States ,20-Sep-18,HUGE!! But I’m starting to like it. Notification issue currently,"Updated:Getting used to the huge display.  Actually had a stranger come up to me and commented how nice it is.  I changed the band to a steel link so it’s a bit classier.Having a bit of a sync problem as it’s not notifying me of texts, etc even though it worked fine the first few days.  Maybe ios12 changed something, but I quadruple checked every setting. Nokia/Withings said they will do a firmware upgrade to fix it soon.  When it worked, the first few days, I really liked it.  Wish it integrated with more apps though.I’m wearing it on my left hand, and all day today, for some reason, my wrist must have kept triggering the button, cuz it kept doing continuous heart rate readings, draining the battery a bit and beeping at me.————Whoa! I expected big but this is HUGE!!  Way way bigger than expected, mostly how high it is!!  I got the 36mm one too and it dwarfs me and feels like it will catch on everything. Pics are erroring or id post. Litteraly just got and battery dead so ill update post after it charges but photos and photos on people are very very deceiving!"
80,Anon,4,the United States ,22-Jul-19,"Gorgeous, functional watch, with great battery life (though I doubt it will last 25 days)","The watched arrived promptly. I immediately charged it and updated the software. I ordered the limited blue (not the sapphire blue, which has a brown band). It came with a plastic sport band and a blue leather band. Both look great, but the sport band is more comfortable at the moment. It looks gorgeous, and I get compliments on it everywhere I go. People cannot believe it is a smartwatch. I was having trouble deciding between the Steel and the Steel HR. I didn’t like all of the features included in traditional smartwatches, but I liked the idea of a fitness tracker that would buzz me when my phone rang. I currently use a Fitbit Flex 2, but it only lasts for 3-5 days at a time. I always forget to put it back on after I charge it. I was intrigued by the battery life of the Steel. But ultimately, I wanted the phone notifications, which are only available on the Steel HR. There is a promise of a 25 day battery life, which I think assumes that you have no alarms or notifications. After one day, I’m at 92% battery. So I think I can expect this sucker to last about ten days to two weeks. Still impressive for a smartwatch. I also think that once you hit the end of its battery life, it has some reserve power to keep the timepiece going. If you’re looking for something with all of the features of an Apple Watch, keep looking. But I don’t care about checking my email, paying, etc. from a watch.Fitness Tracking. I like the step tracking. However, there are complaints about its accuracy. I wore my Fitbit on the same wrist as the Steel HR to see if they matched. I also kept a close eye on my Samsung Health tracker in my phone (which just meant I couldn’t leave my phone on my desk). They were all different, but the two closest to each other were the Withings and my Phone (about 5% difference). The fitbit was about 10% off from the others. That’s good enough for me. The smaller dial with the percentage tracking is helpful. Once I set my goal in the app, it does the math for me.Heart Rate. The HR tracking appears accurate. The bummer is that it doesn’t appear that the software/app takes the HR into account when calculating calories burned. That is disappointing, but not a deal breaker for me, as I usually track my activities in MyFitnessPal. I also participate in athletic activities that require me to take my watch off, so those have to be manually added anyways. But being able to see my average heart rate during a workout session allows me to use the Runtastic calculator to come up with calories burn in the activity, which I then plug into MFP.Sleep Tracking. My fitbit and Steel HR matched very closely in terms of sleep tracking. Both had the same start and end time. The Steel HR picked up some awake time that the fitbit didn’t – probably because of the heart rate change, as I didn’t get out of bed. And both said I got terrible sleep, so that’s accurate. I read some other reviews with complaints about how the Steel HR cannot tell the difference between you lying in bed reading and being in a light sleep. I’m not sure what people expect from a watch. If you have a low heart rate and you aren’t moving, you cannot be mad at the watch for thinking you’re asleep.Watch Face/Screen. I wish the hands and numbers were luminescent. And I think that with the Steel, this would be a problem. But with the Steel HR, pressing the crown will bring up the date and time, so you can check the time in the dark. It would be nice if Withings incorporated luminescent hands and numbers into its later versions.Notifications. The vibration for notifications is pretty strong. The screen scrolls with either a phone or a message bubble (call or text) along with the caller/sender name, followed by the text of the text message. That latter feature – the scrolling text of the message – is pretty neat. So far I’ve only noticed one message that I didn’t feel the vibration. I think it’s because I had the text conversation open on my phone at the time.Alarms. The alarm mildly woke me up, but I definitely wouldn’t use it as my primary alarm. It’s too easy to switch off, and with no snooze, you’ll have to set multiple alarms to be safe. Luckily you can set more than one (three I think?). But using this function surely shortens battery life, so I might turn it off.Overall, I’m pleased with my purchase so far. It’s a gorgeous watch with features that I’ll actually use.I’ll update once I have more data to pull from (particular regarding durability and battery life)."
81,Jack,4,the United States ,6-Dec-22,"Overall, satisfied",Wrist band broke after 9 months of daily wear that I needed to replace. But overall satisfied with the watch. Pulse readings are accurate and phone notifications on my wrist are very convenient and customisable. Battery life has declined a bit since purchasing but still only requires charging once approximately every 3.5 weeks.
82,Teresa,4,the United States ,6-Jul-22,Exactly what I was looking for,"I was looking for a sleep/step tracker and did not like the look of the sport versions.  This watch has a unobtrusive, minimalistic look that I really like. I am constantly asked about it and complimented.  Many people are surprised to find it is activity tracking, it looks like  a regular watch.I am writing this review because after 5 years of wearing it (almost) every day, I think it's life is coming to an end and I am pretty sure I will be replacing it with the same model.Up until this point this watch has served me well.  The down sides have been few.  There is a learning curve for the app, the sleep monitoring is a little wonky if you change time zones or go to sleep after midnight, and there are some occasional, annoying, syncing issues - but that's about it.One of my favorite features, when I first got it was that it held a charge for almost a month.  Lately, the charge holds for about 20 days or less. The crystal is pretty scratched up (it has seen lots of ocean time) and I have replaced the plastic band twice.  In the last couple of days the step counter has been a little off.  OK, maybe a lot off.  Today it says I have gone .45 miles and burned 950 calories.  That would be cool, but not accurate!! My only hesitation...... Is a 5 year life span fair for paying $180.?  I would have thought it would have lasted longer, but I guess that's the way things go.  I liked it enough that after its last gasps, I will probably get another."
83,Alina K,4,the United States ,3-Aug-22,"Great watch, minus the sleep tracking function","I was forced to find a different Hybrid Watch after my Kate Spade watch ans all were bought out by Fossil. I went with a Fossil Hybrid Watch and it was awful (battery had to be changed every month), so I found this one and decided to give it a try.The sleep tracking is awful. It logs me at like 3-3.5 hours a night. I’ve been tracking my sleep for years and I tend to start tossing at this time within my sleep, but I definitely sleep longer and usually get a good 7 hours in. Apparently, as soon as you move in your sleep this Watch just gives up and counts you as awake. It’s rough because this is definitely a feature I appreciate from these watches.Otherwise, I definitely think the calorie function is a little higher than what’s accurate, but I really love the features of the watch. The heart rate function is new for me and seems accurate, as it shows my HR when I’m “immobile” on the stair master. The steps match that of my iPhone, so I find that reliable, too.The band isn’t super breathable but I’ll be ordering a metal replacement, anyways.If sleep tracking isn’t super important, highly recommend for all other features!"
84,John,4,the United States ,8-Jun-20,Great multi-function watch,"I bought this watch in April 2019 (about 14 months ago). I was looking for something that could count steps and other fitness functions. I personally found Fitbits, Apple Watches and other smart watches to be eye sores. I wanted something that looked like a watch that I could wear casually and professionally. I bought the black 40mm version. Note that I was never interested in reading texts through the watch, so this is a function I have no experience in.Pros:- The watch is handsome. What you see in the image advertisements and customer images is what you get. This won't compare to high end watches, but I like it.- The battery life is incredible. If you don't use the text function (hooking your phone up to the watch via bluetooth and reading texts) the watch can easily last multiple weeks. After a few hours of charging the watch can last 4-6 weeks with daily use, if not longer.- While I don't wear the watch while running or exercising, I've sweat quite a bit while wearing it. It's easy to clean and seems well built.- I'm pretty active, so I like the visual pedometer on the bottom of the watch. At a quick glance I can see the amount of steps I have for the day in a stylish form.- The button on the side can show a variety of information, including the date, steps, heart rate and others.- The app is pretty simple and straightforward.- After over a year I have no visible damage to the watch. It looks near mint.Cons:- The minute and hour ticks are very faint. Upon a quick glance you may not be able to read the watch. You will have to get accustomed to the position of the minute and hour hands to read the time and not depend on the ticks. The other styles appear more visual based on the images provided by Amazon.- The glass screen is bubbled above the metal border, which allows it to get bumped and scratched. I still have no scratches, but if you were in a very physical environment I would be concerned it could scratch.- The pedometer is not perfect but appears relatively close. I tested this watch with my Fitbit Charge 2 and it seems like the Withings watch registers about 75% of the steps that the Fitbit registers. The Fitbit seems to over-register and the Withings may under-register. The truth is probably somewhere in-between.Overall, if you are looking for a simple-looking watch that has many of the same functions as a Fitbit with an incredible battery I would strongly recommend buying this. You'll be hard pressed to find a watch with similar features at this price."
85,severin,4,the United States ,19-Feb-21,A decent enough fitness tracker for the casual crowd,"Note: I have had the watch for about a week.I would make a Pros&Cons list because it's really not that black and white.The accuracy is weirdly inconsistent in some areas and somewhat better in other ones.- Heart Rate: (7/10) I heard a lot of not-so-great reviews in regards to the heart rate monitor, and well, it's true. But if you're not in a dire need of the best of the best heart rate tracking technology then maybe any sort of wrist-worn HR tracker isn't for you. (Or get an Apple Watch)- Step Counter: (5/10) The steps are crazy off. Sometimes there's a delay in recognizing the steps but sometimes they just don't register. There have been times where it would register steps while I'm sitting or even laying down.- Calories Burned Tracker: (?/10) I really can't say how accurate or inaccurate this is. As far as I am aware most wrist-worn fitness trackers are not really accurate when it comes to tracking this in particular so I'll assume it's not very accurate.- Sleep tracking: (7/10) This right here is really interesting. The very first night, it did very poorly in tracking my sleep. It said I woke up hours earlier than I actually did and it has done this another 3 times since then. But, and I do mean BUT, it has an interesting feature where you can edit the sleep times (through the app) and has an option to fill in that edited data with sleep data. I can't really say if the filled-in data is accurate or not, but I do believe it's better than having just empty data. I also believe that it takes time for the watch to get used to YOU and your sleeping habits. I've noticed more believable data the more nights I've worn it (even the filled-in data).Conclusion: Overall I do not regret the purchase, BUT it is a little pricey. I would've felt more comfortable with the price being closer to $125. I believe this could be a watch for people who aren't really interested in fast and accurate data, but more so for the casual crowd of folks who need to see minimal data during their workouts and runs.Overall Rating: (7/10)"
86,Jania,4,the United States ,20-Aug-19,Good performer with recharging function,"I have been wearing this watch for a month and am pleased with it's ability to track activities and to recharge.I bought this model because it comes with an external battery charger (USB, so you can plug it into a PC or your phone charger) and that function works well.  The battery charges quickly to 100%.  The claim that the battery lasts over 20 days is overblown, but up to two weeks seems reasonable for those who use the watch to track their fitness. In my experience, it needed recharging after 12 days when I was using it daily to track various activities and to transmit data to the mobile app on my smart phone.  I look forward to NOT having to go to a store to have the battery replaced every year.The watch appears to track my activities with reasonable accuracy, and the heart rate monitor works consistently.  I can't claim to have tested the heart rate monitor against other external monitors but the readings appear reasonable.  The watch tracks my swim strokes accurately, though it appears to require a tighter fit on my wrist to get heart rate readings.The data from the phone transmits well to the mobile app, though this process can sometimes take several minutes.  Interestingly, the app appears to also read ""steps"" data from my iPhone and to use that data when the steps count is significantly higher than what is registered on the phone.  When using the phone while biking or walking, if the app is on and the phone is nearby, the app will use the phone's GPS to build a map of the area you travel.When tracking tennis activity, the app will register steps and heart rate, which I find useful.  It isn't clear how it determines an estimate of calories burned - I assume it is simply based on an assumption of average calories burned during certain types of activity.  Perhaps it adjusts the calories higher based on elevated heart rate.  It would be nice to know, but the documentation is thin, one of the few negatives for me.The watchband is described as silicone, and it is flexible and comfortable, even when pulled tight during a swim.  Withings offers replacement bands, but they are expensive.I've had several complements about the styling, with several people noting they like the fact that it doesn't appear to be a smart watch.The related app works well but isn't great in terms of offering views of activity data.  But, it gives you the basic information.Overall a very good product at a reasonable price.  I recommend it."
87,Amazon Customer,4,the United States ,15-Nov-19,Read this before buying!,"First I must say it's an amazing watch and I love it. It does everything it claims to do at a great price and excellent quality. I did not buy this watch for health reasons but I have quickly adopted it as a ""health"" device for its sleep tracking, activity tracking, wake up alarm (based on sleep cycle and very accurate), and step counting (also very accurate but will catch regular wrist fidgetting). I have to say that getting a better sleep score is probably the biggest thing that has helped me ""health"" wise.Nerd Data: I cut my battery use in half on my phone by using this watch for telling time and notifications and it's been three days with notifications turned on and the watch is still at 100% battery. I send all of my messing apps notifications to it. It will vibrate and scroll across the screen. If you do not dismiss the notification with the button then it will remain until the next time you press the button on the watch and it will display again. Unless you dismiss the notification on your phone then, in that case, the notification is no longer present on your watch. Yes, if you dismiss a notification on your phone it also goes away on the watch. However, when you dismiss a notification on your watch (by pressing the button) the notification does not dismiss on your phone and will remain on your phone. There is more bit of specific information I would like to give that I feel is also important and sadly a negative. When you walk out of range on the Bluetooth connection and you receive a notification on your phone when your watch reconnects to your device you will not receive the notification on your watch.Works with Google Fit: Yes it can import Steps and Weight from Fit. You can only export Activities, Daily steps, Weight, Heart rate, and Blood pressure (if you have a BPM device). You can not export your sleep data to Google Fit.What I wish it did: Tell me the weather. Dismissed notifications on the phone when I dismiss them on the watch.What isn't wrong with it that everyone else complains about in the comments: The analog clock hands are very accurate. The trick is the calibration process. It displays a line on the small screen that perfectly aligns with the ""12"". If you don't calibrate it correctly then it will be wrong."
88,Kmiho,4,the United States ,21-Nov-18,"Beautil watch, so-so functionality.","Background - I had a Fitbit Alta HR for a year and a half that I loved and wore every day, and then bought the Steel HR and have been wearing it for 2 nights/3 days.Pros - BEAUTIFUL watch,  I got the 32 mm and absolutely love the way it looks. I have been struggling to find a smart watch I can wear with pretty much any outfit without looking too gadgetty and this fits the bill. However, the black silicone band doesn't seem to fit the style of the watch (it does easily collect dust) - which is why I ordered a leather band. I like the ""workout mode"" where you hit the side button to start your work out and it displays real time heart rate and work out duration. Some reviewers complained the workout mode only lasting 30 min - I haven't tried a workout this long yet but if I run into this issue I will update my review. The analog watch face looks really nice but I like that you can also illuminate the digital display by pushing the button (great for at night). Some reviewers have complained about only being able to set one alarm - this seems to have changed since you can now set multiple alarms. Also love that it is waterproof and that you can change the display with a button unlike the Alta HR. If it's not immediately apparent, the little dial on the watch face is an Activity Dial which measures your percentage to your daily step goal, so that's kinda fun. Battery life is also fantastic compared to any silimar watch.Cons - the sleep sensor doesn't work nearly as well as the Alta HR, it only measures deep sleep, light sleep, and awake. If I wake up to my alarm then lay in bed for 30 min before getting up my Fitbit would recognize that I'm awake and so far the Steel HR doesn't seem to recognize that (thinks I'm still asleep until I actually get out of bed). This less sensitive sleep sensor also causes the Smart Alarm to always wake you up at the beginning of the window. It also does not seem to pick up when I wake up for a minute, roll over to check the clock then fall back asleep, where the Alta HR would pick this up. Apparently you can upload all of your Fitbit data to your Withings HealthMate account, but I haven't been successful yet. One thing I miss the most from the Alta HR is that the Steel HR doesn't really calculate your resting heart rate but rather averages your ""Day time"" and ""Night time"" heart rates. If you worked our that day your average day time heart rate goes way up, where as the resting heart rate calculation from the Alta HR remained constant even if you worked out."
89,shoe lady,4,the United States ,14-May-22,doesn't count my steps accurately,"first, it's a lovely watch & I do like the idea of a hybrid smart watch; however, it does NOT accurately count my steps. google fit is much more accurate for this. I also love that it holds a charge for weeks. I'm keeping it because it's a cool watch & I am hopeful that they can/will fix the step counting bug. I had full spinal reconstruction about 1.5 years ago & so am able to walk & walk & walk; it's a big deal for me to know how many I take in my average day, so I carry my phone whenever I can to get the google fit count."
90,mike,5,the United States ,15-Nov-22,"beautiful design, it gets compliments..  functions like an Apple Watch without screaming","I really don't want something that looks like a computer, on my wrist.This watch is incredible.With a silicon band and 2 months of rechargeable battery, I can shower, sleep, swim, run, travel for months, etc wearing this watch, ,without taking it off or worry that the battery will die...it just goes and goes and goes...it has a quality glass crystal face, which I have scratched on the floor of swimming pools -  it takes a beating... and yet, it still looks unmarked.  It's like brand new.It has a small OLED display that is great for showing the time / date, in the middle of the night, when you can't see the analogue time.  Doubles as a faint night light for navigating a dark hall.Note: Do not compromise on the cheaper version of Withings (Active / Motion), which doesn't have a rechargeable battery, and has a plastic glass face which scratches easily.The app software experience is hit/miss.  For iPhone - Notifications work 50/50 & GPS mode needs to be turned on once a week, if you want to track hiking or running trails.Sleep tracking quality is accurate enough, to get the point across ( drinking coffee before bed, is going to screw up your sleep cycle, etc).  It helps establish a baseline and figure out good habits from bad.The ease of turning all this movement into a log of charts and graphs for sleep, steps, heart-rate, hiking trails, running, swimming, gym, tennis, etc are a great record of activity.Also, it's easy to find cheap alternative wrist bands on Amazon."
91,V Ong,5,the United States ,19-Sep-22,Discreet and Functional,"I've always worn watches and wanted something that struck a balance between functionality and discreetness. In the past I've used both Fitbit and Samsung Smartwatches. While those had fantastic features, the relatively short battery life and form factor / flashiness were a drawback for me. The Withings Steel HR delivers, being both functional enough as a smartwatch, yet discreet as to be mistaken as a normal wristwatch. It also has a fantastic battery life, which means that I can treat it like any other watch and forget about it at the end of the day.Physically, the watch feels very solid- I have the 36mm version. The face is clean, and easy to read. The silicone strap the watch comes with has held up well to everyday use, and is comfortable enough. The watch strap has a spring loaded pin which allows for it to be easily taken off and replaced. The watch ""dial"" has a nice actuation click when pressed, and is simple enough to navigate with. The heart rate readings and sleep tracking seem to be quite accurate, and have not noticed any issues with it yet.The charging puck is quite large, and connects via a standard USB-A plug. The watch attaches via pogo-pins, and can unfortunately only be placed one way, indicated by an indentation. While a minor limitation, this may limit which side you may decide to lay the wire on. That being said, the long battery life means that charging won't be something done very often.The Health Mate App is a nicely done app. It is easy to navigate, and allows you to set-up, manage your device, along with viewing the fitness data that the watch tracks.In terms of functionality, the watch is quite limited. Beyond fitness tracking, the app allows for wake-up alarms, and notifications. Essentially all apps that send notifications are able to be added to the notification forwarding list. However, I've noticed that sometimes the watch will show the notification icon, but provide no further details. The addition of some sort of play / pause music control would also be quite nice.tl;dr: If you're looking for a watch that is discreet yet function, the Withings Steel HR is certainly a good option to consider."
92,Amazon Customer,5,the United States ,19-Oct-22,"Excellent pseudo-smartwatch with minimal fuss, long battery life","This watch is a perfect fit for me. I like the convenience of a smartwatch that tracks steps and shows me notifications, but I really don't need all the fuss of a full smartwatch. For years, I had a Fitbit (Charge 3 / 4) that did this for me. However, I hated that the screen wasn't all that bright in the daylight, making it difficult to read the one thing a watch should be foolproof at: the time.I love that this watch has analog hands and an analog step counter. A quick glance at the watch face tells me the time and my steps, without the need for a screen to come on and show a poor approximation.I have also been pleasantly surprised by the notifications feature. I thought that, without a large screen, I would only get the sender name and no additional details. However, the notification scrolls across the screen, giving me more text than even my old Fitbit did. All this with a battery life easily double or triple that of my old Fitbit.My only real gripe is that the heartrate monitor is a bit lackluster, since it only checks every few minutes. This can be fixed by going into workout mode, but that really begins to drain the battery. This is a small sacrifice for the extended battery life, though, and one that I'm more than willing to make.If you like the look of an old classic analog watch but want something a bit smarter, this could be perfect for you."
93,mama2boys,5,the United States ,26-Jul-20,"Great watch, terrible charger","UPDATE: After four months of use, I still really like this watch. However, it has gotten quite scratched. Make sure you get a screen protector. The sleep data has gotten less accurate. It does a great job of tracking your sleep... if you don't wake up in the middle of the night. I have also noticed that the time between charges has slipped slightly. Not much, maybe a couple of days, but it is noticeable. One more thing to note is that you have to reset the time on the analog watched her you charge it. Not a big deal, but noteworthy. I still really love this watch and get compliments on it often.I absolutely love this watch. It has all the features I was looking for, but looks fantastic. The app is very useful and easy to use. However, the charger is cheaply made junk.The watch itself is solidly made and initial set up was easy. The battery life is great. Definitely 20+ days. The strap that comes with it is silicone, which I didn't think I would like, but it has grown on me over time. I like that I can pop it off, wash it, and pop it back on. The black watch face that I got is a bit hard to read sometimes, but not terrible. I can always push the button to see the digital time. Features I like: heart rate, activity tracking, sleep tracking (didn't think I would use this, but I really like it). Features that I don't use: calories burned, alarm. The slight vibration for notifications is really useful for me since I am a teacher. I can glance at it quickly to see if I need to excuse myself, or can ignore it. I actually prefer that I can't reply from the watch. I see a lot of others that have that option and it is distracting for them.The app itself is very useful. I really like the setup of the dashboard and the timeline. There is a LOT of information inside the app, as well. It also syncs with My Fitness Pal very well. I use the reminders to help me remember to take vitamins and hop on the scale. I have lost a bit of weight since getting the app, and I find the data trends inspiring. One note: I have had to re-pair my device a couple of times. And you DO have to have your phone with you to use some of the features, like GPS. This isn't a problem for me, since my phone is usually in my pocket when I go for a walk, or on my desk, nearby, when I am at home or work.The charger: it worked really well... the first time. When my watch got to about 30%, I tried to charge it. It got to about 45% and stopped charging. I knew it was the charger, it took a while to convince customer service of this at Withings. I had to purchase an extra charger (which I wanted anyway, but still) to prove that it wasn't a hardware issue with the watch and that I didn't need to return the watch itself. However, after all of that, they are shipping me a new charger.Overall, I really like the watch and the app. They are both easy to use and motivating. The charger is junk. Buy a backup if you find that the watch isn't  charging."
94,Bill,5,the United States ,30-Jun-22,Great first impression,I almost purchased the newer Scan watch because it has a flat sapphire face but I am not a fan of larger watches and have no need for the extra features so decided to give the 36mm a try. On first impression it is a great looking watch although I immediately replaced the band. navigating the app and setting up notifications was easy. Will update my review later if I have any change of opinion.HR seems to show about the same as my old fitbit. Like my old fitbit it has trouble keeping up over 120 but I am also using a non adjustable metal band. It also doesnt kick out of workout mode for notifications which is a big plus for me
95,Nicholas Pater,5,the United States ,5-Aug-22,I like it,"I got this about a half year ago, and mainly use for sleep tracking. I have worn this as my 24/7 watch and it’s been great! Glass hasn’t scratched despite me never taking off to do anything (I don’t shower with it but you could).I would strongly recommend getting a nylon or canvas watch strap because silicon is absolutely not doable if you want to wear this for a large portion of the day."
96,Jorge Argueta,5,the United States ,26-May-20,Great watch but not for fitness,"First, I would like to say that the watch looks amazing in person.Pro:-The band is really soft and makes the watch feel secure around my hand.-The watch is durable, I'm clumsy with my things and often break them but this watch has survive my lifestyle pretty good-It just looks really nice, it is kinda small but that kinda just adds to the minimalistic style that it has.-Notifications are nice, the watch vibrates enough to let you know but not too much that it makes noise, personally I only have notifications turn on for phone calls as I find annoying having it on for everything else that doesn't require my immediate attention.Con:-IT IS NOT AN ACTIVITY TRACKER. Comparing this to my Garmin watch is like comparing my skating skills to Tony Hawk, I know how to skate and do a basic ollie and one or two tricks but that's about it, the same goes to this watch. While it does ""Track"" your workouts, if you go for a run it uses your phone's GPS, so might as well just use you phone to track that run, all the other workouts are not as accurate.The Ok:-Sleep tracking is ok but to be honest there are not that many watches that are accurate with sleep tracking without manual input, I do like that it tries to wake you up in your lightest sleep face when you set up an alarm in the watch.In conclusion. I will be keeping the watch to use it as a normal watch that counts my steps and lets me know that I have a call coming in but I won't use it to track my runs, I'll use my Garmin for that"
97,Michael John Barnes,5,the United States ,25-May-18,well executed and easy to use product,"First off, I write very few product reviews on Amazon. Second, I work for Amazon in product development & product experience design. Third, I have owned so many fitness trackers I have lost count but spanning 3 different Nike Fuel Bands from the very early days and the very first wrist heart rate/ fitness trackers from Mio etc etc.So, suffice it to say I have been using QS (Quantified Self) fitness/wellness products from the early days of IoT including the Gen 1 Withings scales etcWith all that said, this is simply an extremely well thought out, well-designed, well executed and easy to use product. Despite all the Fitbit reviews and plethora of tracker choices, I intuitively felt this would be the right product and design for me. It definitely is.It does not have a bunch of superfluous hard-core features you will never use, but for me, it has ALL the features I will always use! Steps, calorie burn, sleep, heart-rate, discreet vibration for notifications/phone calls, and best of all killer battery life.It integrates with the elegantly designed and mature Health Mate App along with the excellent Body + scales (which I also own - a great combo). It just pairs instantly, easily and works simply without additional interaction or hours of frustration and tears. So many products don't do this, I know...I have owned them. The box opening to actual use journey on this product is the shortest I have ever experienced and has been really well thought out.Hats off to the Nokia/Withings team for seeing the need for an elegant timepiece with the fitness essentials and delivering a great-looking product with just the right balance of features/price that is not at all techy, clunky & pairs over Bluetooth first time seamlessly and the onboarding experience is effortless. I even synced it with a seldom used, several years old Withings profile from my generation 1 Withings scales and it imported that legacy profile fine too!The only thing extra I personally would ever want is multiple alarms and multiple time zone clocks I could step through for monitoring my teams when traveling - I have to track 5 time zones ( California, Austin, London/UK, Tallinn/Estonia, Japan) , but this could be very easily added via software update. (**Please Nokia consider these features if you read these reviews which I know a good Product Manager does!) :))"
98,Abraham Ayorinde,5,the United States ,20-Sep-22,Great gift for giving,Long battery life and beautiful.  The glass is not the best.  Possible to get it switched with sapphire?
99,Lisa Idell Sassi,5,the United States ,5-Apr-21,Well worth the money - love my Withing watch.,"I’ve had this watch for over a year and I absolutely love it.  I can even compare it to the Apple Watch.First, the battery life is spectacular on the Withing watch. The battery life on the Apple Watch absolutely sucks.  The Withing watch has not been charged for a month and it’s at 50% right now.  I had to charge the Apple Watch every other day.I love the watch face, how simple and elegant it is.  The features of the watch is easy to use with the push of the side button.  The list of exercises you can program is extensive.  You can also choose to get notifications on the watch for texts, phone calls, or apps.  It tracks sleep cycles and steps accurately.I also bought the Withing scale which is was a very worthwhile purchase as well.Definitely very happy with the Withing purchase.  It has been well worth the money.  And I never wear the Apple Watch anymore.  Yes, the Apple Watch has a lot more features, but I almost always have my smartphone with me and felt it was duplicative and overkill to have a watch that does the same thing my phone does."
100,MP H,1,the United States ,4-May-22,"Inaccurate tracker, buggy app","I bought this product because of the analog watch face - I just couldn't read Fitbits outdoors, where I usually exercise. Also, the battery life was highly attractive. Plus, any 20mm watch band fits it - that's really nice. I was also intrigued by the fact that one of the workout tracking presets is for equestrian sports. It seemed like the perfect device for me (I'm a dressage rider).However, after just about a year and a half of using it, all of those good points are completely overshadowed by the device's shortcoming - the app (Healthmate) is HORRIBLE and customer service is worse. The app dissociates from the watch several times a day, so I can't rely on it display incoming calls or text messages when I'm working out or otherwise have my hands too occupied to pull my phone out.I have a perfectly good scale - I don't want to buy the fancy one that the app can pair with, but you have to wait 24 hours to manually enter a weight. I've brought this up to customer service several times but they won't help me unless I get a video of the problem. Yes, they want me to have my husband video my trying to make a manual entry, have him send the video to me so I can send it to customer service. And the customer service emails are long and ungainly because they copy the entire thread in each reply, so the conversation becomes impossible to follow.Real-time heart rate tracking doesn't happen, and when I review my workouts there are a lot of places with no heart rate data. Its step counter and the one built into my phone disagree by about 10-20% most days. Thus, I question its accuracy as a fitness tracker.The sleep tracker is also wildly inaccurate - it consistently shows that I wake up at 0345 (my actual wakeup time is 0420).Bottom line, it's a wristwatch that gives you a vague idea of your sleep and activity levels. If you're serious about tracking your health and fitness, pass on Withings."
101,Amazon Customer,1,the United States ,11-Nov-19,"Great watch, horrible customer service","Bought this watch on October 15th, charged it up and worked great.  Then I needed to recharge the battery probably 2 weeks later. I put it on the charger, grabbed the watch the next morning and while at work I realized it was not charged and had about 8% left so I knew I would easily make it through the day. Got home that night and put it on the charger and nothing happened. Tried different outlets, plugs, restart, etc. I contacted Withings support and this is where the one star comes in. I emailed them, and they had me try a few things and none of it worked. They asked for a picture of the charger, so I sent them one with a video of me placing watch on charger. Now a new person emails me back and asks me do do the exact things I did with the first person. I replied and told them we had already been through these steps and I believed it was a bad charger. Now another person replies and we are back to square one again. By now, the watch is sitting on my dresser dead and unusable and I am getting frustrated and told them.  This is the reply:“ Thank you for writing back and I appreciate the photo and short video clip you sent.I understand that you have done all the things we have asked you to do and yet the issue persists. Please know that our team is currently conducting a thorough investigation of this matter. Thus, I will have this support case put on hold and will keep you posted as soon as a resolution is in place.Thank you for your patience and your understanding and I'm deeply sorry for any inconvenience.”Well, lucky for me by person #2 I was impatient and wanted to use my watch so I bought a charger off of Amazon and, drum roll please...it charged on the new charger I bought. Wow, that was difficult. I can’t believe how bad their customer support is. I would send the watch back, but I am past the return date. No big deal I guess since I do like the watch and spent money on a band. I hope one day they figure it out and either pay for the charger I bought or send me one. Be careful if you buy. If you have any issues, their customer support is horrible and would be easier to return the watch and buy a new on."
102,Hardibity,1,the United States ,15-May-20,"Exactly what I was looking for, if the features worked","The media could not be loaded.
                



 I really wanted to like this watch. Aesthetically very pleasing and it has exactly what I was looking for and the battery life is impeccable! I just wish the features actually worked. I thought I maybe have received  a faulty watch but after going to their website, it seems these have been an issue for over a year with no solutions. Four issues (all that have been on their website forum for over a year without any solutions from the company):1. My biggest gripe is that they report it works with MyFitnessPal. I use this because their healthmate app doesn't have food logging. Their Withings app does not automatically sync the step count to Myfitnesspal. You have to open up their app, refresh it, then open up myfitnesspal every time. This should be done automatically like every other watch. If you don't do this, then your steps will be logged incorrectly every day (see video)2. Step count from their app vs watch step count off both off somehow. I don't understand this since their app should be getting the step count from the watch, but the app always reports more steps (see both pictures)3. Gets email from my Gmail account widget however it does not send notifications from the iPhone email widget.4. You have to unpair and pair every morning if you have your iPhone set to DND overnight. Otherwise, you don't get any notifications.Also, the increased the prices on their watches. I purchased this for $150 and they are now selling it for $200. For that amount, I’d suggest the garmin vevomove 3 (which is what I replaced this with) or the fossil HR. Also, I still have my heard back from their customer service. Terrible product and service"
103,Martin Edic,1,the United States ,18-Nov-19,Mine is defective on many levels and they won’t deal with it,"Do not buy this watch. The only star-worthy thing about it is the appearance, it’s problems make it worthless to me. For a start, it will not sync up to Bluetooth and it’s app. I have been back and forth endlessly with Withings’ customer support and all they can do is keep copying and pasting things from their Help app that do not work. It is defective and they will not back it up.- it does not keep good time. It is currently 7 minutes fast and you cannot adjust it without the app, which, as noted, it can’t connect to- I just returned from a cross country trip and had no way to adjust it for time zone changed. Useless.- the only thing it tracks accurately is steps and the app can do this without the watch- none of the other exercise or sleep functionality is accessible because of the Bluetooth issue- notifications do not work for the same reasonI have repeatedly asked for a replacement or a refund but this is ignored or they refer me to Amazon, which only takes things back with less than thirty days. In the first month I still held out hope that there was a fix. Now, six months later I am fed up with this piece of crap and this company’s incompetence. As I said, don’t waste your money on this or any of their products.Since I wrote this a few days ago it has gotten worse- it will no longer charge at all. If you work with Withings/Nokia you should be embarrassed to have anything to do with a product this poor."
104,sa,1,the United States ,11-Feb-19,Terrible materials make this product abysmal.,"I researched a great deal for a good looking sports watch. Features like continuous HR and sleep tracking were a must. I already own an apple watch but it felt tiring af with all the apps and stuff. I finally settled on this model.Pros:The design of this thing is great. It’s very well thought out. There’s no bulky OS like Apple or Android so it’s multi platform compatible. They also implement Bauhaus style and it’s one of the best combo I’ve seen.  Withings also make great health products and as expected the heart rate monitor is great. Sleep tracking is also supposed to be one of the best.Cons:It’s a shame they didn’t give the execution the same respect they gave to product design because this thing is terrible. There’s a one star review mentioning glare and whatnot and I thought it was manageable but the glass itself is very badly produced. $10 watch on ebay have better construction.The hr monitor maybe accurate but I got burn marks/allergy reaction within a minute. I think it’s allergy reaction but I don’t have any allergy so I settled on burn marks. I did get similar marks on Apple Watch but it was after 48 hrs of continuous wearing and it didn’t itch. It also went away in a couple of minutes. Withings mark is going to stay for a while.I look forward to Withings executing this better because the concept, design, etc. is great. They badly need a re construction and a new manufacturer if they want this thing to succeed."
105,Christopher P Scott,1,the United States ,28-Oct-22,"Great features, but not durable","This is a great watch with an insanely long battery life; however, the glass cracked within 2 months of owning it.  I don't remember hitting it hard at all.  For a ""sport"" watch, I would've expected it to be more durable."
106,James Long,1,the United States ,7-Sep-20,Fragile piece of junk,"After exactly one week of ownership I looked down and it was shattered. I’m a 47 year old dude in the suburbs. Today I did some exercise, did some yard work, and took a hot bath. When I got out of the bath I noticed the watch face was foggy. Turns out the crystal was shattered. I didn’t fall. I have no bruises, and I have no idea what broke this piece of egg shell masquerading as a watch. I’m very disappointed as I’ve never broken a crystal on a watch in my life. This thing is clearly poorly designed.Update: I was pleasantly surprised that when I contacted Withings they replaced my watch. I was unpleasantly surprised that the watch required manual adjustments of the hands every few days. It will tell great times them one day it will be off by 15 minutes. This is just stupid as crap to have a watch this technologically advanced but it can’t point the hands at the right numbers. And today I’m trying to set the hands but I can’t without first resetting my password. This piece of trash annoys me to no end. I completely regret buying it."
107,Michael Ngarimu,1,the United States ,8-Mar-21,Caveat Emptor: Erroneous mileage; customer support asinine at best.,"Below amateur product. Customer support worse.Long story short. The companion app (Withings Health Mate) started incorrectly reporting mileage run in the workout summary. Split times were correct for complete mileage. Mileage was complete right before ending the workout. Mileage reported on the Withings website was correct.Since the summary mileage in the companion app was incorrect, the calories burned was incorrect (too low) and incorrect data reported to other apps making any level of fitness tracking useless.I spent weeks back and forth in emails with Withings asinine customer support. Lots of apologies, many guarantees that they're going to change, and no actions to actually resolve the issue. The last straw was AFTER I provided screenshots where their own website showed the app was broken Withings support gaslighted me with ""why do you think anything is wrong?""After reading other reviews I'll be forking out over 3x the price of this for the Coros Apex Premium in hope that Coros are professional."

109,Dustin Jay Allison,1,the United States ,10-Sep-19,Overpriced watch with step tracker,"I switched from a Fitbit Charge to this  because I needed a tracker that looked more traditional in a professional setting and I already have the Withings scale. The watch looks great but is otherwise useless as a smart fitness tracker.The calories burned calculation is based on total steps and NOT the heart rate. I used to question why until I realized the HR tracker is inaccurate and off by at least 40 bpm when compared to manually checking HR during exercise.  Now, the HR tracker for exercise sessions has completely stopped working only 2 months after starting it.Want to track your running route and gather those statistics?  You’ll have to bring your phone along for that to work which defeats the purpose of having a small tracker.The text/call notifications never work either even though my tracker is connected to Bluetooth.At this price point, buy a Fitbit product. Any Fitbit product will be an upgrade from this device."
110,Jeffrey Finkelstein,2,the United States ,15-Jul-20,A quality hybrid fitness watch worth considering as long as you never need support for problems,"Starting with some history. I’ve been a long-time FitBit user from the original bands to the Charge 4 and Versa 2. Was very happy with them, at least until the recent problems related to battery life (needs a charge every 3-4 days) and app crashing. The last update was the biggest disappointment as it bricked my Charge 4 which was 1 month out of warranty. I did manage to get it working again after a complete factory reset, but it really should not have happened.I was looking for a fitness device that would track steps, sleep, heart rate, different exercises, and have a long battery life. As a result I purchased the Withings HR Steel at first in black. What I learned was it did exactly what I needed and looked more like a traditional analog watch. Unfortunately the black hands on a black background were too hard to see with my aging eyes.I sent it back and got an HR Steel Sport with a black background, which according to the pictures had brighter numbers and indicators. When I received it I found that it still had the same issue of not being able to see the hands in low ambient light. So back it went in exchange for another HR Steel Sport, but this time with a white background.The white background made all the difference. The watch is easily readable in all light and does not strain my poor eyesight as a result. Regarding the fitness features the steps are a bit off (maybe 2%-3% compared to the FitBit), heart rate is about 1%-2% high compared again to the FitBit, and sleep is as accurate or inaccurate as the FitBit depending on your view. Battery life is exceptional at approximately 20-25 days between charges. I go for long walks daily which does not put a tremendous drain on it as I use my phone connection for GPS tracking.I very pleased with the Withings HR Steel Sport in white and if like me you are an older person it is not a strain on the eyes to read the time. While not as accurate as the FitBit Charge or Versa, it is close enough for my use. If you are looking for a more traditional looking fitness watch this is one worth considering. Amazon has been wonderful handling the returns and everything could not have been easier.Pros:Nice looking easy-to-read analog watch with a small black circle below 12 for notifications and detailsExceptionally long battery life, I can get up to a month with my occasional exercise and daily walksVibration alarm is enough to wake me from a deep sleepComfortable on the wristWaterproof enough for my swims in pools and oceansCons:Healthmate App uses excessive amount of phone battery and over 24 hours can use up to 50% of your battery worst caseHealthmate App is okay, not nearly as good as FitBitOnly 3 alarms availableNo countdown timer or stopwatchSteps are off by 2%-3%Sleep is inaccurate compared to FitBitOriginal band is okay, but replacement is much better for comfortWithings support is very bad, you will never get a response for problems or questions posted in their forum."
111,Yaz,2,the United States ,2-Oct-21,"Works fine, but has some infuriating issues","First, I'm going to start with the good. It's a stylish item. The battery life is amazing. The interaction with the watch to do stuff is intuitive. One button: press once to scroll through the basic tracking features, long press to scroll through specific activities you selected in the app.There are a few issues with this, and some are infuriating.- I noticed a skin reaction to the band that came with the watch, it seems that my skin is allergic/sensitive to something they use in the band. I bought a third-party band and that resolved the issue.- Heart rate tracking is weird, you'd have to roll the watch around so that it's over the veins on the same side as your palm, basically think in movies where they check the wrist for a pulse. Otherwise, don't trust the heart rate reading.- The app is lacking in useful features, it keeps a log of things, but it's not useful otherwise, except to correct the most infuriating thing about this watch:- The hour hand 'drifts' over time, basically you set the watch and 'zero-out' the hands, then over the next couple of months the hour hand starts lagging until it's about an hour behind. So basically, you have to re-zero the hand every few weeks.- This is not a bad thing about the item per se, but it's a loss of features from an earlier item I had from the company. My previous tracker was able to detect certain activities automatically and start logging them. I swim a lot, with the old tracker, I just jumped in the pool and started swimming, with this one, I have to remember to start tracking my swimming, otherwise it won't get logged. After a few frustrations with forgetting to do that, I guess I acquired the habit, but it's sad to lose that feature."
112,Slip,2,the United States ,23-Jan-21,Great concept — but quickly stopped working,"Pros: Simple watch, which offers exactly the functionality I needed, and nothing extra. I wanted something that would track HR and location for my commute bike rides and casual runs and sync the data to Strava, and this did the trick.Cons: stopped working after 3 weeks. This was actually a stepwise descent. First it stopped displaying notifications (texts and emails), which was not a big deal to me. Then GPS tracking (which it outsources to your phone via Bluetooth) became intermittent and unreliable. Finally, the watch refused to connect to my iPhone at all. I did factory resets, reinstalled the Health Mate app, toggled every possible relevant connection.... and eventually the watch became totally unresponsive. As I only bought it three weeks ago, I am still in the window for a free return, and will get a refund. I’ll try to find something from a different manufacturer, though I did like the concept of this watch a lot.One other con: the watch face is totally unreadable in low light. It would have been nice if they could have made the hands luminescent, or something, like real watchmakers have been doing for years.Another con: syncing to Strava is slow, and when it does sync, it adds a comment in the description of your activity which is basically a little advertisement for the watch. I have not seen any other activity tracker use the description field in Strava in this way. It’s obtrusive and annoying — and annoying to have to delete it so as not to spam your Strava feed."
113,metzmedia,2,the United States ,14-Oct-22,Dead pixels in the display.,Loved the watch until the pixels died in the display.Now it's just a watch.
114,kra9235,2,the United States ,26-Jan-19,"Nice Looking, But Not Accurate","This is a very nice looking watch.  It is also comfortable to wear.  This is my second one as I returned the first since it was very inaccurate in counting steps.  Unfortunately, the replacement is not much better.  I contacted Withings customer service, and their response was the algorithm was designed that way.  They said that it was so false readings while brushing teeth etc would not be counted as steps.  This is flawed thinking.  The step counter is under reporting 20-40% of steps taken.  How many false steps would be recorded brushing teeth and even so, I could adjust for those false readings.  If this thing will not recorded my normal steps that should be counted, I don't have any use for it as that is that main reason why I bought it.I have run dozens if not hundreds of tests.  I will count my steps and compare to the Steel HR Sport and my phone.  My count and my phone are within 2%.  The Withings will be low by 20-40%.  All they need to do if offer a sensitivity adjustment to fix this which should be possible since they stated it was their algorithm that was managing false readings.  It is a shame as this watch is great in every other way.  Great battery life, good looks, decent app.  I guess I need to look elsewhere for a nice looking hybrid."
115,S.K.,2,the United States ,30-Apr-21,Battery A - Durability F,"The battery life of this smart watch is what sets it apart.  Sadly that is the only thing - while the features are ok it does take a little bit of training to get used to them.  The major issue is with the single control side button - otherwise know as the single point if failure.  It's a watch so I wore it a lot and the button would get bumped, well now it doesn't work so I can't access any of the features that make it a smart watch.  Warranty is good for a year - mine lasted 19 months - Withings offered a discount replacement but I would rather rent a watch at 10 per month and more features then buy this again.  If you do buy it I would also suggest getting a face protection, mine was scratched almost immediately."
116,Sergio,2,the United States ,4-Jan-20,Sad it didn’t work out the way I wanted it to.,"I liked this watch...I have been wearing this watch for about a month. I appreciated it I set my silent alarm and all was good.I noticed the first time I went to charge my watch (8-9 days later) that I had some skin peeling where the heartbeat sensor is. I didn’t even think it was related because it was a little higher than the center of the sensor. Fast forward to the next time I had to charge it and there was another spot where my skin was peeling and was itchy! There was also some redness around it. Sadly I had to return the watch because of this. I liked that I got up every morning and saw how my night was and how much more active I needed to be throughout the day. I liked the info that was available to me in the app and that you could modify the sleep cycle if needed.One other thing I’ll note was that when I was exercising and my heart rate was up, the watch would not read it for some odd reason. The only time that heartbeat was accurate was when I was at rest at my desk."
117,JLC,2,the United States ,24-May-21,Great watch and HR tracker if you could see it,"Heart Rate tracking seemed to work very well and the battery life is phenomenal .  I found the fitness tracking very confusing to start and use on the watch and never got it to track a run correctly.  What really killed this product for me was the poor design as a watch.  The numbers and hands on the version I bought were too light to be read against the black watch face.  The crystal is so poor, the watch is IMPOSSIBLE to read in any kind of sunlight because of the glare / reflection on the crystal.  I ended up returning it and going with Garmon Vivomove HR.  You may have better experience but this product just failed as a watch for me."
118,Average Consumer,2,the United States ,14-Jan-22,Disappointing heart rate results,"I wore this for a few days. The watch never stayed connected to my Samsung Galaxy S9. I missed notifications. I will be forced to return this since the heart rate results were terrible (pictured) even though I wore it correctly, missing huge chunks of data throughout the day. This is my third watch with a heart rate monitor and I've never had this issue before. The watchface is hard to read due to gray on dark gray face and glossy dome. The band is very flimsy making it difficult to get on."
119,Daddy Bear,2,the United States ,15-Feb-20,"Bad sleep tracking and step tracking, no way to adjust","I have used trackers before, but I didn’t want to have constant notifications throughout the day on multiple devices.  The Garmin I had was great for sleep tracking and steps, but I didn’t like the constant notifications (this is a model from 4 years ago).My first night wearing this watch, I had late work needs and I was only able to get 5 hours of sleep.  My average night of sleep is from 7-9 hours.  I just woke up to find that while I had just under 8 hours of sleep, the watch/app said I had 4hrs 12 minutes of sleep and then no movement for the last 4 hours.  Whatever AI is being used here is a massive failure.  The original band, as mentioned in many other reviews causes sweat within hours, so if you want to ignore the review... make sure you buy a separate band.That said, the watch is good looking and the heart rate measurements are accurate, but it fails on over half my needs."
120,Leo K,3,the United States ,15-Jun-19,A nice looking watch with aspirations in becoming a fitness tracker,"I upgraded from a FitBit Charge 2 to this Withings Steel HR primarily because my healthcare provider’s group accepts data from Withings into my medical records and not FitBit. That being said, I’m not entirely convinced this watch is worth additional $50-60 markup compared to the FitBit.Let me start by saying that I really like the way this watch looks and feels on my wrist right out of the box, something I couldnt say about the FB Charge 2. The strap on the FBC2 was stiff and uncomfortable. The strap on this Withings watch it is quite soft and remarkably breathable, but that's also where the first issue I have with it. The watch itself is considerably heavier than the Charge 2, combine that with the soft wrist band, and the watch quickly begins to lean away from my wrist, which causes the sensor from to also lean away from my body, causing it to get inaccurate readings. I prefer to wear my watch with the face located on the bottom of my arm instead of the top, but wearing it this way, I notice that the sensors has missed my heartbeat ratings during several workouts. The only way I’ve found to make sure my heartbeat is captured during exercising activities is to have the face on top of my wrist and the strap set more snuggly than I consider comfortable. Doing this ensure that sensor has direct contact with my skin no matter what. I will probably be replacing the strap soon, similar to the Velcro one I got for my FitBit.The second issue I have with the watch, which isn’t obvious from the pictures on here, is the watch face's color scheme. The pictures on the advertisement must have either been enhanced or had some extreme lighting to illuminated the face. The advertise picture looks like the markings are white, when in actuality it more of a light grey. On a white face, this wouldn’t be so bad, but I opted for the black face one, and having light grey numbers along with light grey hands, makes telling time a bit of a chore. Even in outdoor natural sunlight, I find it difficult to tell the time, everything just seems to blend together. I think a lighter color for the watch arms and numbers would have been better.And if you think that pressing the button to activate the digital display would help, that too is pretty anemic. The lit screen is pretty dim and impossible to see under bright lights, or even in a dark room. So basically, I have a watch difficult that can't rewliable be used to tell what time it is or how much time has passed during a workout.Overall, I have mixed emotions over this recent purchase. The watch look like an actual watch compared to a FitBit, but I find reading the time on it to be difficult at a glance. The standard wrist strap is more comfortable than the FitBit’s default one, but because of the weight of the watch and the soft wrist strap, watch hangs a bit loose, making heartbeat readings inconsistent. As a result of these two issue, I decided to knock down .5 stars for each issue, making this a four star purchase. I may change my ratings for the better or worse if I notice anything different with the watch’s overall performance, like maybe the battery life. So far its been 6 days since the watch arrived and was fully charged. I’ve used the exercise feature on it everyday, and synced it up with the Health Mate app on my phone on a regular basis and the battery is showing 85%. Curious to see how close I get to the promised 25 days.UPDATE 7/11/2019 – Dropping one star from my previous 4 STAR review, primarily because the issues I originally notice haven’t worked themselves out. Long short, it doesn’t matter which way I wear the watch, face above or below wrist, there’s a high likelihood that the fitness portion of the watch will NOT record my heartbeat, drop chunks of my workout routine despite showing up as connected to my mobile device at all times.Oh, and battery was 8% the morning of the 27th day. I guess that's one positive things I can say about the watch.UPDATE 7/16/2019 – Dropping yet another star, this time because Withings customer support it lack luster at best.I recently log into my doctor’s online health portal and noticed that it hadn’t received an update from Withings since April. Suspecting something was configure wrong when I initially setup my account, I logged into Withings website to see what was going on. That’s when I noticed it wasn’t my doctor’s website that was out of date, but Withings. Apparently, it hasn’t been receiving data from my watch in months. That’s not entirely true, it hasn’t received my heartbeat reading since April, it’s been selectively collecting data from me since then. I check my Healthmate app on my mobile device and its all there, everything I done, look online and its patchy at best.Reviewing their online help page/forum, I found no mention of this specific problem and no obvious way to correct this discrepancy. I contacted their support site and was greeted by a drone who ask me to provide the information any normal help desk person could have found if they just bothered to look up my records. I responded, but why do I have to give you my information, when all they have to do is simply look it up on their systems."
121,CDA,3,the United States ,8-Dec-18,"I really want to like this watch, quality control and build issues. Get the white one","I saw this was on sale for Amazon's 12 Days of Deals. I've had an Apple Watch since series 0 and needed a step away from tech, but wanted a watch instead of a standalone fitness tracker. Plus the ~25 day battery life was attractive.I had concerns when I saw previous reviews from September to now show build and fit issues, but was encouraged when I saw they were resolving issues like the lower numbers now no longer flipped right side up.The newer units now aline with what the marketing renders show for the numbers around the casing.But right out of the box, I noticed build quality issues.I noticed the lower left area of the watch appears to have some sort of markings like residue or debris from packing. Or so I thought, I tried to vacuum out and wash to see if it was just cardboard dander that made its way from the packaging, but I see it's the watch glass pressed against the casing and it's in areas all along the watch, like small air bubbles. It's not noticeable when looking at the watch straight down, but even a little tilt will show the reflection of what ever the build issue is, be it the adhesive or lack of fit and finish of the glass to the casing.I also noticed the case markings do not align with the internal watch body markings. This was evident when calibrating the hour and minute hands.Also, attempting to pair my watch took longer than it should have.I had to reset the watch 4 times, and unpair once.Once I got the watch paired, I had to restart the pairing 4 more times, because the updates would incrementally fail.The watch was fully charged and less than a foot away from my iPhone 6S on 12.1.1.The charging cable is not magnetic, only allows you to place the watch in one way, and is basically terrible.You have to have the watch placed in the cradle just the right way, and there are two pogo pins to plug in to one charging hole, the sound of the metal scraping against the case makes my ears cringe. Glad I will only have to charge this thing hopefully no more than 20 times a year.I want to like this because, well, it's a decent price, and it's not an Apple Watch or Wear OS watch.Want to get away from notification hell and just track sleeping and basic activity.The Health Mate App is nice and clean and easy to navigate.I'm going to order another one and see if that one is any better.**Update 12.10.2018**I ordered the white face version.And it’s night and day.Personally prefer the black face version.But I have less issues with glare with the white face.Build quality on this version is spot on. Hour and Minute hands needed no adjustment.The hash marks on the bezel and watch face line up.Pairing only failed once and update didn’t fail at all.One more star added to my review."
122,GT,3,the United States ,26-Sep-20,It's an OK device but couple big draw backs,"I started using this after an Apple Watch Series 3. I started off really like the Withings Steel HR Sport, but ended up having a few issues.What I liked:1. It detects a variety of activities and health metrics.2. It imports some of the other health data (such as weight, BMI, and blood pressure).3. The app, while maybe a bit slow, shows data in nice graphical ways.4. It can export data (it would be nice if you could export data any data you want as a .csv or Excel file, but at the least you get PDFs and/or images with the graphs of data).Problems:1. It would undercount steps. Even after I adjusted the strap and wrist position, I would test it and it still would miss steps. I'd go up & down stairs or walk 40-100 steps across my house. The watch would either not count any.2. Withings says it is compatible with Apple Health; however, more than 1/2 the data does not sync correctly. I got the steps and sleep to transfer correctly from Health Mate (Withings' app) to Apple Health, but the heart rate, workouts, and VOx do not transfer over. [As to the question why I want data in Apple Health and Health Mate: Apple Health has some other data, and I'd like to have a consolidated view of my data.]3. The  customer service people are friendly, but not to useful. When I pointed out the above problems, they had me try a couple steps a few times, but even after 2 weeks they have not given a solution. <== This is the main reason for a 3 star review and why I was almost tempted to leave a 2 star review.A couple features I would like to see:1. Built-in GPS and altimeter (yes, I know it can import the data from my phone, but I don't want to have to run the app on the phone when I'm running or hiking and drain its battery).2. The actual VOx measure (rather than just a relative measure compared to other people).3. Live measure of # of steps during a workout (as is, you don't see how many steps you've taken during a run)."
123,James Jordan,3,the United States ,13-Oct-18,Works well - but doesn't look as good in person - and there are production issues.,"First, I want to say that I really like the potential of this watch. In fact, functionally, it's doing exactly what I want it to. It's fun to have notifications on my wrist, the silent alarm is great, the heart rate monitor is informative, the battery life is seriously impressive, it's not a massive encumbrance on my wrist, and the Health Mate app has been functioning well with my Android phone.Aesthetically though, it's a different story.The black version of this watch doesn't look nearly as good in person as it does in the marketing pictures. For one, the mineral crystal is very reflective, which I believe is accentuated by the dark watch face. Second, it's very difficult to read the analog time in lower light. I don't mean darkness - I just mean when lights are on, but dim. I think it's the combination of the reflections and the fact that the numbers aren't as vibrant white as they appear to be in the product shots/renders. Those renders just don't convey the product the way it is in real life.Two obvious things stand out when you compare a picture of my watch to the product shot:1. The etched numbers in the casing around the face are flipped on the lower half of the watch compared to the render. This is actually better for readability, but it's the first sign that the marketing pictures aren't an accurate representation.2. As other reviews have stated, the hash marks on the face (at least on my watch) don't align with the etched numbers on the casing. That's indicative of loose production tolerances, and I happen to be someone who is easily bothered by misalignment. In the attached picture, it's easiest to see the alignment issues when you look at the etched numbers 35, 40, 45, 50 and 55 compared to the longer lines that are supposed to match up, as portrayed in the product render to the right of my actual picture.Finally, I've worn the watch for 2 full days and nights, and this morning I had to take it off due to discomfort. My wrist has a red rash where the watch has been making contact, underneath both the strap and the case. I should stress that this is likely just me having an allergic reaction to the materials - not necessarily a problem with the materials themselves. I've had this issue with a Fitbit in the past. It's just something to note if you're prone to this kind of reaction. Regular watches don't cause this problem for me - but I also don't wear those overnight.All things considered, I will likely be returning this watch."
124,Chris Joseph,3,the United States ,14-Mar-20,Hmmm,"Ok I will be subjective here as it not my first smart device. I did buy it to track my sleep and heart rate and it did meet my price point for a wearable device, given my previous adventures into way overpriced smart watches.That said, below are my comments.Pros.Smart looking watch that easy to set up out of the box. Dead simple actually.Looks quite good and the band has a lot of adjustments to it so should fit all wrist sizes.The watch face is not over the top so you can use it for most occasions, which is a good thingIf you have a large wrist however, it may look like the watch your mum got you when you were young. Small face.Cons.Battery life at best is 2 weeks. Whilst it’s still good versus other smart watches, it’s not even close to 25 days. I’m assuming you only get that if you don’t look at it, press the mode button (which after a month is getting sticky) or do anything unusual.Sleep tracking. Best used as a guide as even though I wear the watch as suggested, it just doesn’t seem accurate by way of sleep length. Often I need to go in and manually adjust the results.Syncing to google fit is a complete joke.  Now I know there are better fitness apps out there than google fit, but I have been using it for a very long time. All my other smart watches have over the years managed to sync up without issue. But, this little guy is totally random as to what data is sent to my main fitness tracking app and often requires some manual input into the google app to keep score on what you have been up to.Sorry Withings, but there are a ton of people out there having the same issue and you simply need to fix it.No excuses these days to say your products can sync up but only offer a half hearted attempt.All in all, the watch is fine and for the money (there are more expensive product out there) I’m ok with it.  A few fixes to the sync up and this review would have gained an extra star or two."
125,Amazon Customer,3,the United States ,5-Oct-22,Buyer beware -- no standalone gps,"The GPS only works in conjunction with phone. Do not buy for the gps feature, like I did. Battery life and mobile app are very clean though."
126,Hans Lellelid,3,the United States ,13-Mar-21,"Style points, but hard to read, poor HR sensor and unreliable alarm.","First the good: the sleep tracking seemed very accurate. Comparing it to my Garmin Vivomove 3, the Steel HR did a much better job at actually knowing when I was asleep vs just reading a book before bed, etc. I like the sleep score too -- well, at least the concept; my sleep score is abysmal! :)The watch (black in my case) looks great and was fairly comfortable.  I like the more modest 42mm size.Unfortunately, I returned my Steel HR because the alarm was not working reliably.  I don't know if it was an issue with app (Android) not correctly syncing but the alarm completely failed to go off on two different occasions and the second time I had double+triple checked that it was all correct in app and syncd. Since this was a must-have feature for me, I returned the watch.When the alarm did work it woke me up easily, so I guess there's that.Additionally, as others have noted, the analog hands of the black watch are basically illegible in anything but direct light. Given that the point of analog for me is quickly seeing the time, having to scrutinize the dial seems like a failing.  Form over function there, I guess.Additionally the optical HR did a terrible job of tracking exercise for me. I tried different positions on the wrist.  I would compare to chest strap and the watch would be saying 80-90bpm when chest strap was reading the correct 140-160bpm during an indoor cycling workout. That wasn't a critical feature for me, but worth noting."
127,Thomas Chastain,3,the United States ,30-Dec-19,"Wanted to love this watch, but the feeling was not reciprocal","I purchased this watch after owning a Fitbit Alta HR for about a year and a half (I actually got the watch at a customer golf outing, after much reluctance).  I enjoyed the Fitbit quite bit, mainly for the ability to keep my phone on silent and get alerts on calls/texts and that way I could avoid my work emails during the day until I decided.  Secretly, I like the step counting and it keeping me motivated to move throughout the day.Fast forward to buying the Withings.  I had high expectations going into purchasing it, but wanted to go back to a more formal watch face, with the functionality of the Fitbit.  Unfortunately, I did not like how this functioned. For instance:*When an alert came in (if it did, the watch missed several calls/text because it was not on my body, which truthfully I usually leave my phone in another room when I am at the house)  it would auto play, if it was a text for instance.  Not that big a deal, you think, but if I don't want the text to play automatically.  We have a strict no phone/electronic rule for the dinner table and this was annoying.  Fitbit's raise to read feature is much better.*Too much of a pain to get your step count.  Also, either my Fitbit greatly overestimates my steps or the Withings greatly underestimated my steps.*Impossible to read display with polarized sunglasses.*There's no way the sleep tracker was correct.  I am not disillusioned to believe Fitbit's is 100% accurate either, but this did not track anywhere near correct.Watch fit and felt great on my wrist.  If this is your first smart watch and/or you can put up with the difference I could not, this watch could be a great fit.  At the end of the day, I returned it and went with a Fitbit Charge 3 (added the sport band and love it)."
128,KQRYtheOZ,3,the United States ,9-Jan-19,"Love Withings, but not this watch","I was hoping and expecting to really like this watch and there are lots of things I like about it. But in the end it's disappointing for one primary reason.PROS:- It's a REALLY pretty watch (see my pic with a 3rd party band)- Battery life is phenomenal (honestly, 3+ weeks between charges)- Part of the Withings ecosystem (I also have a WiFi scale and blood pressure cuff)- Bands are pretty easy to swap out- A good step counter- No touchscreen (which my sleeves always seem to activate -- this is a pro!)- It seems to always be in sync with my phone (Samsung Note 8 running Android Oreo 8.0)CONS:- Activity tracking is a bust!- Goals for steps per day does not adjust- Not able to track stairs- The reminders don't seem to be working for me- I see no way to turn on ""wake me at the optimal time"" setting- The screen for messages/info is pretty tinyMy main disappointment is with activity tracking since this is really supposed to be an activity tracker. First, on a treadmill you'll get pretty much nothing. That's okay since they don't claim to do anything for treadmills. A bummer, perhaps, but nothing more. But for two out of my most recent three bike rides (of over an hour and a half) they were not recorded. Oh, they started out fine; I know because I was watching the watch. But somewhere along the route the watch not only stopped recording it actually deleted what it had been recording. Ugh! I've been using a ""Garmin Forerunner 235, GPS Running Watch, Black/Gray"" for the past 3+ years and I really liked it. But it's not a particularly pretty watch. The Withings watch is much nicer looking but the Garmin blows it away in terms of functionality. Better activity tracking (for the sports it can cover), pairs with footpods for treadmills, automatically adjusts daily step goal based on previous days, and it also has multi-week battery life.In short, if you're looking for a fancier step counter with some smart features you will probably LOVE this watch. However, if you're hoping to get an actual fitness tracker you will probably be disappointed in this just like me."
129,Jeannie,3,the United States ,22-Oct-18,Android not quite ready for primetime Supposed to be a November update,"The watch itself is light, looks good, and I find the band to be very comfortable.  If I was sure that in the future the Android bugs will be worked out I would give it 5 stars.  I'll update my rating if it does.  Syncing to my IPAD, and staying connected through Bluetooth is fine.  However, trying to sync through my Android phone app is an exercise in frustration.  Let me preface this by saying that it states on the Withing web site that there should be an firmware update for Android in early November.  However, as of now it syncs maybe 1 out of every ten times.  The bluetooth connection between the phone and the watch is awful.  In three days I've received only two call notifications that made it to the watch.  Not a single text notification has gone through.  I can only assume that this is also somehow related to the aforementioned Android syncing issue.  After forgetting and reinstalling the bluetooth connection on my phone multiple times, I gave up on receiving Android phone notifications and simply sync to my Ipad once a day, to set the alarm, etc. Remember, you can't do anything, even setting the time or an alarm on the phone itself. It is all accomplished through the app. If you're relying on an Android phone solely, you'll be very disappointed as things currently stand.  So while I really like the form and the functions that work, do I keep the watch and hope that the Android issues are all addressed in the November update?  If they're not, it will be too late to return the watch, and my choice will be to either buy an Apple phone, or forego the notification features as continue using my current Android phone.  Clearly, the Android app is not ready for Primetime. and if you rely solely on Android, I recommend on holding off on purchasing until the early November firmware update, and see if the glitchesd\ are cleared up.  Only other issue I have is I wish the wake up alarm vibration was a bit more vigorous. I sleep right through it on occasion"
130,Demo318,4,the United States ,13-Oct-18,"Looks Good for Business, Useful for Fitness","After 3 DaysMy aim was to buy a watch with fitness/workout/sleep tracking comparable to an Apple Watch but which was stylish enough to wear to work. I wear a suit to work in a Four Diamond hotel, so not just any watch would be fitting for my daily dress code. The Withings Steel HR Sport meets these requirements wonderfully (and, compared to Apple, cheaply)!Setting up the watch and syncing it to my phone was a breeze. The Withings Health Mate app has a great aesthetic, and the process was very straight-forward. The app does have you calibrate all of the dials (the crown on the watch doesn't turn - it's just a button - so you move the dials with the app on your phone), which felt tedious, especially for the small steps-goal %. Fortunately, you can re-calibrate at anytime through the app if you get it a little bit wrong.Withings recommends wearing the watch one finger-breadth above the bone on your wrist. This is to ensure the HR monitor isn't put at any funny angles and can't take readings. I've been wearing mine comfortably lower than that (closer to my hand), and I've had no trouble getting HR readouts.The HR monitor is really slick. Throughout my day, it's taking measurements (every 10 minutes, I believe), and I can pull up the app and see what has been measured. I can also use the button to initiate an HR reading at anytime (It will immediately display the results from the most recent reading, if it quietly took one in the background, and then take a new reading if you wait just a moment on the HR screen.), and then when you go into fitness mode, it monitors continuously (as well as initiates GPS tracking, when connected to your phone). The step counter has also been great to have on my wrist. Throughout the day, I have checked both the digital screen and the little dial to see how I'm tracking. And when you reach your goal, it vibrates and displays the step count to let you know.Tracking sleep data seems accurate so far. It does a good job of continuing sleep monitoring even if you get up for a short while in the middle of the night (such as when taking care of an infant). One morning though, I woke up, set the watch on the countertop while I took a shower, and found later it recorded my whole morning routing as 30 minutes of 'deep sleep' which inflated my 'sleep score.' You can go in and edit your asleep & wake-up times, though, so a quick adjustment made the data more reliable. Alarms are also based on your sleep cycle, trying to wake you up when you're not in a deep sleep. It has worked well for me so far. Also, the watch itself is hardly noticeable when I sleep (unless I don't turn notifications off), but the band it ships with isn't all that comfortable. I think I might get something fabric, not silicone, for sleeping.At first, I thought interacting with the screen would be frustrating. I thought that perhaps I would feel constrained. In fact, it's quite the opposite. It's almost a relief not to have a deluge of digital information on my wrist. The notifications have been great. I can see if a message/email needs to be checked right now or not, and if it does, I pull out my phone to deal with it (which is what all my Apple Watch-wearing friends seem to do anyway). The single-button design works really well, too. In the app, I can customize which screens the digital display can show.I admit, I haven't done much exercising with it - just a few long walks so far. I hope to have some exercise in before my next update to this review.After 1 WeekThe band included is really not that comfortable, I found, which is why I'm glad this watch uses a standard 20mm watch band. I ordered a different sport band, and the result was immediate. My wrist has been much, much more comfortable since.

Sleep tracking has worked really well. Sometimes, if I set my watch down shortly after waking up, the watch will think I'm still sleeping. I've been surprised a couple times to see that the app shows I was in a 'deep sleep' when in fact I was showering or brushing my teeth. Withings made it quite easy to go into the app and adjust the 'wake up' time, so that any sleep data collected while you were awake is disregarded.For the most part, the notifications on the watch have been really useful. Even though they're just short snippets of text that scroll by, they've still been useful. I much prefer glancing at my watch instead of pulling out my phone from my pocket to see who that text/email is from.Notifications only work, though, for applications which have been integrated by Withings. I wish there was some way to see notifications from other apps on my phone. For example, I use Waterlogged on my iPhone to help me ensure I'm drinking enough water throughout the day. I wish those notifications popped up on my wrist as well as my phone.There are no move reminders. If you sit all day long, your Steel HR Sport will not complain (unlike an Apple Watch or Fitbit, for example). Perhaps there's a way to use an iPhone app which can send such notifications, but I haven't found it yet.The battery life is incredible. I put this on the charger on October 10th (just to try it, not because it actually needed charging). It is now October 16th, and I'm at 58%. That includes several sessions tracking activities.Activity tracking seems to work really nicely. It even automatically detects workouts. I had a little impromptu soccer game with my two-year-old. I was running around, heart rate elevated, for about 15-20 minutes. As we walked away from the field, my phone buzzed with a notification ""workout detected."" It automatically categorized it as 'other' (which isn't surprising, soccer with a toddler is a pretty unique set of movements), but I could easily hop in the app to change the category and add notes so that it was recorded effectively to my log.I've been using this in conjunction with dieting to. The companion app Health Mate ties in with MyFitnessPal very well for comparing calories burned with calories consumed.One downside to mention is that I'm not sure the Steel HR Sport counts stairs climbed. On a walk I tracked, it counted elevation in the post-workout stats, but I'm not sure if that was from the watch's onboard telemetry or comparing GPS info to known topographical data from other sources.I've hit my 10,000 step goal a few times now. I love the little celebration notification that pops up. It's rewarding and well done.Finally, I really, really like the look of the watch (I have the white watch face). I've noticed at work a lot of folks wearing Apple Watches. To me, they know look large and clunky (especially with the extra armor/cases they put on to protect them). Every day, I'm quite glad to be wearing a watch that looks like a watch.After 1 MonthI still love this watch. It seamlessly fits into my day-to-day as a pair of glasses or perhaps a favorite coat. I'm not often presently aware that I have it on, until I check the time or perhaps my heart rate.Notifications work better than previously thought. The companion application becomes 'aware' of a notification after it has appeared on your phone. Here's a step-by-step of how to get an app on your phone to show notifications on your watch:1) Install app on your phone (this app will not show up in the watch's companion app yet).2) Have the app ding your phone with any notification (now the app shows up in the watch's companion app)3) Open up the Health Mate companion app, and enable your notifications.4) Enjoy getting buzzed on your wrist.Additionally, it seems there is a correlation in battery life and notifications. If your watch is buzzing every couple minutes all day every day with notifications, the battery wears down more quickly. Even so, it still seems to last forever.The watch band that the Steel HR Sport ships with is decidedly terrible. I found it profoundly uncomfortable. The 3rd-party watch band I mentioned above has been incredibly comfortable, day & night.Over the past couple weeks, the sleep and alarm features have been great! I've had to edit my sleep data a couple of times. Three times, I've woken up, set my watch down to take a shower, and found the app thought I was still sleeping. A quick edit fixes that and gives me good data. Once, I supposed I tossed and turned so much that it didn't think I fell asleep until much later. Again, a quick edit with my actual bedtime corrected the data.The only hiccup I've seen so far is regarding steps. For whatever reason, in the day following the last software update, I was given 397 complimentary steps per hour from 6p - midnight. I had already put in 18,000 steps that day, but you can imagine my shock when I woke up to find Health Mate reporting 27,000. I've yet to speak with Withings to see if I can correct the data. It hasn't happened again since that one instance.I still haven't much used the sport features. Also, there's at least one micro-scratch on the watch thus far. It's only noticeable upon close inspection. I did buy Amazon's suggested 2-year warranty, just in case.Just today, my wife asked me, ""What don't you really like about your watch?"" And I surprised myself a little when I replied, ""Nothing. Now that I've replaced the band, there is nothing that I don't like.""After 3 Months (coming January 9, 2019)After 1 Year (coming October 9, 2019)"
131,Jeffrey M. He,4,the United States ,26-Sep-19,Indepth review: Great sports watch for data driven athletes.,"I've had this watch for about 10 months now and for the most part I love it. It's not a smart watch in the sense that you can run apps, respond to messages, etc but it does carry a lot of great fitness related functionality that is perfect for anyone looking to track their sports activities or daily health metrics.- - - -The functionality that it has includes: Time (both analog hands and digital display), step counter progress, heart rate, distance, calories, alarm, battery level, and notifications.For time, there is a physical analog hour and minute hand that you can just glance at anytime. If you want to view the digital time, you click the control button (there's only 1 button on this watch) which will turn on the digital display to show you first the day of the week and then the date of the month. So for example (Thur, 26th) with the Thur on top of the 26th. About 1.5 seconds later, it will show you the time (ex: 11:52am). I usually just look at the analog hands, unless it's dark and I can't see the hands in which it's super handy to press the button to see the digital display light up.As for the display itself, the brightness level / contrast is very good, so that you can easily read it even during a sunny day.To go through the different functionalities and screens, you keep on clicking the (only) button to scroll through them. You can choose which ones you want to see on your watch, as well as the order of them on the app.For step counter, it just shows you how many steps you've taken so far this day, as a numerical count (4232 Steps). There is also a progress circle at the bottom on the watch that displays your progress with a physical analog hand. The progress updates as a circle, with a full circle completion (imagine an hour hand going from 12->12 position clockwise). Once it makes a full rotation, that's 100% of your daily goal. What your daily goal is can be customized in the app. Once you surpass it, it continues at the same rate. So if your daily goal were 10000 steps, it would be at the 6 oclock position once you hit 5000 steps, then at the 12 oclock position once you hit 10000 steps (and you get a vibration and a small message showing you've hit your goal!) and then for example, if you got to 12500 steps the hand would be at the 3 oclock position. The step counter resets at midnight each day, though there doesn't seem to be a way to change that (in case your a night shift worker, etc). The app will keep records of number of steps you take each day.Once you toggle to your heart rate functionality you can see what the last measurement of your heart rate was. The watch actually tracks your heart rate throughout the day, though only once every few minutes (unless you're in active sport tracking mode). If it's been updated within the past few minutes, it'll display the heart rate and when it took it (ex: 77bpm, 6 min ago). If it hasn't updated, it'll show a loading screen while it measures your heart rate, about 5 seconds maybe, and then display your heart rate. You're also able to see your heart rate and average heart rate throughout the day in the app, as well as a history of your heart rate in the app.For distance, it also keeps track of the distance you've traversed throughout the day (Ex: 2.4 mile). though unless you have it actively connected with your phone it's not necessarily accurate since the watch itself does not have GPS functionality, it only derives GPS functionality from the phone.Calories. Honestly, there isn't really an accurate calorie burned tracker out there, since there's so many fitness variables that affect how many calories you're actually burning. (Weight, height, BMI, fat level, oxygen level, metabolism, after burn effect, etc etc). So I'm not going to really comment much on the calories - but in general it seems to be just based off of steps and heart rate, coupled with your age, height and weight that you can set up as a profile in the app.Alarm. It vibrates your watch based on the time you set, which is done in the app. I don't really use it.Battery level. A digital display of how much battery is left via a picture indicator and a percentage number.Notifications. Also don't really use this much - it vibrates and then displays text messages or notifications as scrolling text in the tiny screen it has. It can be helpful to get a quick look into what the message is about but in reality it takes a long time to scroll through the entire message or notification and I'd much rather just pull out my phone directly and read faster. Also if you're like me and get about a hundred notifications a day (actually I have about 75% of notification turned off so the ones I get are actually ones I need to read) then it just gets annoying to have my wrist constantly vibrate.- - - -To get into active tracking mode, you long press the (only) button and from there, you can click the button to scroll through up to 5 different activities to track. Once you get to the activity you want to track you can long press the button to start tracking, and once you're done, you can long press again to end tracking. While in active tracking you can click the button to toggle through different stats, like time, distance, heart rate, steps. Which 5 different activities are available on the watch are set in the app. The app has a lot of different sports, and you can choose which 5 you want on the app.Once in active tracking mode, it constantly monitors your heart rate, and also can map your exercise route (for sports like running, hiking, cycling, etc. Not for things like volleyball, tennis, etc where it wouldn't make sense). However, your watch needs to be connected to your phone for route mapping to work, as again, it doesn't have built in gps functionality.- - - -The app. The app will contain all the information as mentioned above, as well as a history of all the information from each day. The watch can only display current information for that day, and you cannot see history of stats like some other phones or trackers can. However, all the information will be there on your phone in the app. In the app, besides the history for each day, it gives you a nice weekly graphical summary of your sleep and steps. In the app is where you also set all the settings and options and personal info as mentioned throughout the above section.For sleep, you can see how well you slept each day, including light sleep, deep sleep, and periods of activity during your sleeping period. It does this based off of movement it seems, and so it's not the most accurate but pretty good for the most part. However, if you're watching a movie and you literally don't move at all, it might track that as sleep if it's late at night, or will log it as a nap if it's during the day. Similarly, if you're someone who turned or moves around *a lot* when you sleep, it might treat that as a period of awake-ness.The data from the watch gets uploaded onto the phone whenever you open up the app the sync the watch and phone (or if you have background refresh enabled it'll sync automatically periodically). I've tried going a week with not syncing my watch and my phone and the watch seemed to hold all the data fine, so you don't really need to worry about the watch not being able to hold enough data and thinking you need to sync everyday else you'll lose your data. You won't. :)One last thing, maybe the best thing I want to touch on is the battery life. Because it does not have: GPS, large or color display, idk whatever else you think a smart watch should have but it doesn't, since it doesn't have all those fancy (and in my opinion often necessary) random things, the battery life on this thing is AMAZING. I usually get over a month of battery life usage on this thing if I'm tracking sports activities for less than 2-3 hours a week. That means that I don't need to bring a charger and don't need to worry about it dying whenever I'm traveling, which is a huge plus. If you're tracking a lot of activity (for example, a multi day hiking expedition), I find that the battery will last about 50+ hours of active sport tracking (for hiking at least) with gps mapping."
132,Anon,4,the United States ,6-Aug-22,"Classic watch first, smart watch second","I've been an activite pop owner for 5+ years and it finally broken and I decided to upgrade.I wish I upgraded sooner. This is a sleek analog watch first and fitness, sleep and steps counter second. Was looking at the scan watch but the reviews weren't good and I wouldn't need an ECG. Plus it didn't have the table stakes features that other $300 watches had.What I use it for: tracking runs with heartrate, outdoor cycling, tracking sleep and keeping track of time. Publishing activates to strava.What it's great for: tracking runs (you can quickly click through heartrate, distance and elapsed time with precise gps turned on) without checking your phone. Quickly activate your run or ride by pressing a button twice on the watch! no fumbling around on your phone or anything. Easy. Also, it's a watch. It's not another screen that you have to wake up or get distracted. Don't like apple watches for this reason.The good: battery life is incredible, charging is easy via USB. Regular use is like 3-8% of battery life everyday. LCD display is easy to read and one button interface is very intuitive. Includes regular stopwatch, timer and alarm functions as well! Phone sync is very fast (< 10 seconds) which you can do once a week to sync up data with the app. Or more frequently for sleep. Publishing run/ride data to strava is easy and includes all the data (strava premium account). Strap is soft and stretchy, lots of adjustability. Text messages that are links, photos or other are just displayed as a text message icon, kind of nice.The bad: grey dials and black watch face is difficult to read in low light (button does activates date and time but still). Calendar, text and phone notifications (apple IOS) doesn't work 100%. Some days it's working, other's it's not. I think it's a phone thing. Text messages are limited to 50? characters on the watch. Would be nice if text scrolling speed could be faster or adjustable.The ugly: No continues heart rate streaming to 3rd party apps, ie it's not ANT+ compatible so you'll need a heart rate strap or similar if you are riding a peloton or have a garmin or wahoo. Contactless payments would have been nice but not a deal breaker. Siri/assistant voice would have been nice but not a deal breaker.Overall, love it. Happy to find a rechargeable smart watch with long battery life and fitness features. Would recommend."
133,Mr Steve,4,the United States ,28-Oct-18,after using a solid week.,"I wanted to wait a full week or two after using this watch in order to give an informative review.  First off, I had previously worn a fitbit Charge Hr for a few years, so most of my comparisons will primarily focus between these two.I decided I already spend enough time on my iphone and didn't want to be further impeded into the Iphone world, so I decided to look for a hybrid smart watch as I always prefered both the round analog style and was growing tired of the fitbit charge HR look (tended to be look like a prison release bracelet).Initially I was drawn to the black face Withings Steel HR sport as I think that looks better especially in terms of hiding the small black OLED circle on top.  Unfortunately, after reading several reviews I learned that it was difficult to actually see the black face of the watch due to the highly reflective glass.  Here is my first complaint.I wish Withings would have opted for a gorilla glass or other super tough scratch resistant glass. I predict that this mineral glass they use (especially with a ""raised"" or bubble effect will ultimately lead to an easily scratched surface when working out or just knocking against things).  Currently I am hypervigilant about not scratching it, but know that ultimately it will get scratched.  So I opted for a white face and it is easier to see the face, but there is a glare nonetheless.  The graphics on Withings website of both style watch are greatly photoshopped and they have removed the glare. Trust me, you will have glare (more the on the black watch over the white).In terms of customer service, it is very good. They will respond to your emails within 24 hours, although frequently will just repost some template or pull down menu.  If you email them, you will need to be very specific in your question and request that they don't respond robotically.I have found their app Health mate, (where you see all your results) to be actually very good.  I assumed it would he inferior to the fitbit app, but am pleasently surprised.  I see the basics, steps, sleep etc.. but they also have good suggestions for improving your overall health (unlike the annoying constant reminders to move from fitbit). I would say that if you are truly using your device to perform at a much higher level of fitness (i.e. dedicated athlete within a particular sport (running a half marathon or something similar) you would be better off with either a fitbit or garmn device as both of those will drill down better into a sport metric.  for people like me, who's goal is to just get a bit healthier, the withings is good.They have a whole list of sports you can track but most are silly and just fill up a pull down menu (badminton, wind surfing) but regardless you will get your top 5 that 99% of the population uses. (running, walking, fitness etc...)I like that this will track your V02 and after running outside for 10 min, the connected GPS (yes, you'll need to carry your phone) accurately tracks your distance and will give you a health score using how well you use oxygen as a measure of your cardio health.On the withings, I was a bit surprised it was lower than I had expected as my fitbit always gave me a pretty high cardio fitness score.  So here is an observation, perhaps the withings is a tad more accurate in its analysis.  additionally, I never trusted the fitbit sleep score as often it would tell me I was in a deep sleep when actually I was watching TV.  Sometimes the withings will confuse just lying in bed with sleep but the results are more accurate.thus far I am happy with my purchase and would recommend.  I wish they would allow you to run a treadmill to track your vo2 and not have to run outside in the cold, but oh well.I wish they had a white background OLED screen with black lettering scrolling across for the white face watch as it would improve the overall appearance.I turn off most of my notifications.  But you will see who is calling or texting (the text is merely a simple scroll across) if you allow them.I think this will always be a niche product and if you like having something a bit different than the rest of humanity, this might be a better fit that a fitbit or apple watch.In the end, the apple watch can do far far more than the withings HR, but more than I will ever need/want.the fitbit will have greater detail information on your workouts, but more than I can absorb.the withings is a great choice and after one full week of using, I am still at 66% of original battery life."
134,Alessander Firmino,4,the United States ,6-Oct-22,Good for HR and Activity tracking,"Amazing good looking watch, I went for the white version since several reviews talked about how hard was to read time with the black one.  Since I workout about 5 times per week (3x tennis, 2x gym) the battery life lasts about 20 days, a bit less than the stated 25 days, also I keep the notifications off for email and messages. The watch does a great job for activity tracking, HR monitoring, however it is horrible for sleep tracking unfortunately. If that is your purpose, look for another watch. I also didnt like the silicone band, so I replaced with a leather band, which made the watch look even more slick. I would rate it a 4 star overall."
135,M.A.Sykes,4,the United States ,27-Jul-22,Good value and great looks,"I like the notifications for texts and phone calls. You can't answer calls via the watch but you can see who's calling and grab your phone to answer. You can see you have an email but you can only read the sender and maybe the first line of the email it scrolls about 2-3 times if the set it up the vibrations. That's find with me since I usually just need to know it I got a text or email and whose it from anyway. I can't see a way to see how many texts or emails and once it scrolls the notifications there's no way to retrieve it without going to my phone, which is not a deal breaker for me as I don't like being a slave to my devices. The variety of apps you can setup for notifications is hefty and the battery life seems very good. Once fully charged the display stays at 100% for nearly 3-4 days then it begins a slow decline to 0% over the next couple weeks. Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase because the watch is doing just about all the things I need it for. The Sleep Tracker gives me a score percentage which I trying to see if I like it or not but so far good watch."
136,Cliente de Amazon,4,the United States ,6-Jan-21,Very impressed with this watch.,"I previously had two smart watches that I liked a lot. The LG Urbane first generation and the Fossil Explorist 4 with heart rate monitor. Both great watches. The LG Urbane had a better battery life than the Explorist, however, it did not have a heart rate sensor on it. One thing that I absolutely hated was charging these things every day or every second day or risk losing your data. While I like the media player and see a brief glimpse of a notification, I gladly would have trade all that for not having a charger with me all the time. I shopped around for a bit before I settled for the Withings Steel HR Sport. I wanted a hybrid watch and I think I found what I wanted. First, I will describe my only gripe with the watch, I expected it to be bigger. That is it. My Urbane was slightly bigger and my Explorist was bigger by about 20 to 30%. That is the only thing. Everything else I have liked thus far. It is a good cross breed between simplicity and elegance and I love it. Truth is, I barely feel it on my hand, but in a good way. I slept with it last night and I can't compare it to the Explorist, which used to bother me throughout the night. I barely felt it, to the point that I thought it had fallen off. It woke me up when I needed it, even though the vibration is not as intense as the other one. Even the strap it came with is awesome. I read bad things about it in another review and I proceeded to order some other ones because of it, but I found that the review missed its mark. The strap is very comfy, it does not rub against my skin and it dries up very quick after a shower and it can be taken out in a cinch. The notifications show up as the messages one sees on electronic boards when driving on roads with traffic conditions. It is quite neat actually. The convenience of changing a music track on a smart watch or lowering/increasing the volume of the music is something I can easily live without. I am very happy with the purchase thus far. And I think anyone who buys this watch will not be dissapointed."
137,Patrick Ladd,4,the United States ,24-May-20,This watch hit all the checkboxes,"I spent a long time looking for a hybrid smartwatch.  My watch had to be waterproof, have an analog face, be easy to bluetooth, have notifications, have high reviews, couldn't have a garishly large face, be moderately priced, and have good battery life.This watch hit all the boxes in my checklist.  Bluetoothed on first try (I NEVER get that with ANY device).  The notifications for text, phone call, or calendar reminder are perfect (even includes part of the message).  I have had it for 2 weeks and still haven't charged it (44%).  I like that there is a button to scroll through features and not a touch screen that doesn't work when you want it to and does work when you don't.  It's advertised with a 40mm diameter and I assumed that must be the inner glass but this is definitely a modestly sized face, which I like.  The band is very comfortable too.  Very happy with my purchase.When I'm biking, sailing or skiing, I can't use two hands to press a little button or tap a screen to display time (flipping wrist to display time is annoying when you are sleeping and the watch keeps lighting up).  Also, sometimes in the brightest sun with sunglasses on, a digital display is difficult to read.  This analog faced watch solves those problems.Cons: I got the gray one because I didn't like the black spot on the white faced watch.  In the sunlight, the hands are very easy to see.  But sometimes at night in dimly lit areas, the slim hands are difficult to see (this is why I gave 4 stars overall but I think it's a 5-star watch otherwise).  But it's outside when being active that I need to quickly glance at watch for time and it's not a problem.  I think the gray face is nice looking, just wish the hands were a little more prominent.  I question the sleep tracker a little bit (but don't really care about this feature).  It sometimes has me sleeping when I'm actually playing guitar (am I that bad?) because I've removed the watch from my wrist.Despite my cons, I liked this watch enough to buy a second for my son's 8th grade graduation."
138,trackerman,4,the United States ,25-Jan-19,"Overall, I would purchase again - but not perfect.","I have had this watch, with the white face, for over one week now.  Easy to set up and not much you can do to mess it up.  Android app also works well.  Battery life is amazing!  I used to charge my LG Urbane once a day - and I would lose tracking during this time.  This watch? Eight full days and it is at 75%.  Wow.  I find the watch to be fairly accurate with step counts and pulse recording, and sleep tracking has been good so far.  I also find the fit to my wrist to be perfect - not too high off the skin either - looks nice and classy.Bluetooth connection to my LG V20 phone works well, but every now and then the phone can't find the watch - usually after wandering away from the phone and returning.  The GPS tracking connection to my phone has worked well too. Why not five stars?  Attention to detail is lacking for a watch in this price range.  As others have noticed, the hash marks do not precisely line up with the outer markings, especially the red triangle at 12 o'clock.  Also, the minute hand is not precisely indexed to the hash marks, and it cannot be adjusted out using the app time-setting process.  Gosh, my $33.00 Timex Expedition is spot on, and it has the Indiglo back-lighting that I wish this watch had because there is no way I can see the hands at night.  And yes, the white face with the black display looks weird - I just tell people the watch is solar powered, which is easier to explain. Another issue that astounds me is the lack of seconds being displayed.  Yes, I can enable the tracking feature to see seconds, but I would expect to see them when i press the button once with the date and time display function.  I am also sad that the watch is made in China (A country that I try to avoid purchasing from - and no where could I find where the HR Sport was made.  I was hoping for Switzerland, which is where prior withings watches were made), which might explain the lack of attention to detail.  The LG Urbane is made in Korea and it is flawless.Overall?  I am a little sad about the build quality, but I will keep it and wear it until something better comes along - like a LG smartwatch, made in Korea, with a 45 day battery life.  (I can dream, right?)"
139,C. Redmond,4,the United States ,7-Nov-18,Good looking watch with great features,"I've seen reviews where the etched numbers do not match the watch face, however, my watch did not have this problem so hopefully they've fixed this.I'm basing my review off owning the watch for 1 day, but I feel confident that I will not have to update this review much.The last watch I owned was an iWatch 2, but after the screen cracked unexpectedly I decided to go a different route.Pros -Physical hands -When I bring my wrist up to check the time, I don't have to close out of a prior app or wait for the watch to wake.  I've got real watch hands that make this device look like a watch first.Battery Life -I took the watch out of the box at 100% and have been wearing this watch for one full day so far and the battery life is currently at 78%, I don't know if it will last the full 20 days, but right now anything beats having to charge your watch daily.Sleep Tracker/Alarm -The wrist watch detected when I was awake this morning and woke me up within my 30 minute window.  I'm a very hard sleeper, so if my phone alarm wakes me up I either don't hear it or I turn it off and roll back over; the watch sensed when I was awake, vibrated my wrist and I got out of bed with no issue, what a difference.  I don't know how accurate the light sleep/deep sleep stats are, but I'm more confident in it's ability after sensing I was in a awake/light sleep.--------------------Cons -'Connected' GPS -This is definitely my fault for not investigating this or having common sense about the size of the watch and the battery life, but the watch gets its GPS by connecting to the phone, it does not actually have a GPS unit built in.  I think the reason they call it connected GPS is because based on the activity you put the watch in, that's when it will tell the phone to use GPS.No Glow Hands -This would more than likely detract from the look of the watch if they made the watch face glow to see the hands at night, but it's just something to mention if anyone's curious about this.  You can, however, click the side button to activate the digital clock, but you do have to wait 1-2 seconds for the time to show after the date.  I'll update this if I find out there's a way to change the order of what displays first.--------------------"
140,B. Normal,5,the United States ,29-Apr-19,Best heart rate / sleep tracker I could find!,"This is an excellent watch for what I was looking for and I'm really glad I found it.The one remaining concern I have for it is longevity, because for $200 I expect this to last at least 3 years.But to sing some praises first:- Great battery life, quick recharge8hrs in exercise mode (continuous HR monitoring) takes about 40% of the battery for me. Otherwise the battery seems like it will last a month if I didn't use that mode.- Looks goodI literally had someone comment on how they would rather wear this than an Apple watch because it looks like a normal, nice watch. I agree, although the Apple watch has a lot more features and I'd use one if I liked their phones at all.- Solid HR trackingThis was the reason I bought and kept this watch, the HR tracking is solid. The sensor could be better like the multiple larger lights in the galaxy watch, sure. But the galaxy watch and almost every HR monitoring wrist band on the market right now sucks. Either because they all skimp on the HR monitor or because the design doesn't make effective use of the sensor (including algorithms to get accurate HR from the sensor) because they don't think anyone wants to have accurate, continuous monitoring. But I do. I use this watch in workout mode to record my HR during exercise, where tracking can be hard for light based sensors. Other watches, including galaxy watch, suck at this. Sometimes sweat buildup messes up the reading on this one too, sure, but it happens way less often and swiping my finger under the reader fixes it right away. The watch itself is designed intelligently to push the sensor down onto your skin without pushing the entire watch body into it and causing chafing, unlike most other devices in this class. A simple yet effective as hell solution! Good job to the designers.- Water resistanceI have had several devices like this and this one really makes me feel good with its simplistic physical design there is only one place where sealing could be a problem and it looks thoroughly sealed (button). I have worn it in the shower, swimming, and sweat like crazy during workouts on it, zero signs of any issues.- Data is accessibleThe HR data is transferable to other apps easily too, unlike the garbage data hoarding most of these companies do (Samsung health, more like Samsung hell). This was another huge plus for me. I use Withings app only because it does have a few nice addons to it I enjoy, but I feel a lot better knowing that if I didn't like how the company was behaving with my data they allow me to use the watch with other apps.- Sleep tracking is goodHonestly the tracker is really good, I wish it had stronger compatibility with Sleep for android because it does a great job of detecting when I fall asleep, when I wake up briefly, etc. But it isn't compatible yet, so I use a Mi Band additionally for sleep tracking. I do like to compare their data, and this one is usually more accurate. The data IS accessible, it can be exported and then imported to Sleep, so that's nice, but obviously not how I wanted to do it.For cons, I'll have to think hard:- Stock band is a bit suffocatingI haven't had a chance to try other bands but I know with other watches I haven't had any instances of them trapping sweat under the band in a way that causes irritation the way this one has. It's not hard to fix, just keep it clean. I might buy other bands to try out in the future.- Face is a little small for meI would prefer something the size of the galaxy watch, but that's very much just a style preference.- Gimmick VO2 feature?I got this version thinking I'd like to use the VO2 feature but it ONLY works if you run outside where it can get GPS and elevation data during your run. I run on a treadmill, so I'm out of luck until I go hiking. That was disappointing to find out.- PriceOf course I wish I paid less for it. I could have got the non sport version to save money since I'm not using that feature. But overall I'm using this like a fitbit for twice the price. I don't care about the notifications, it's not really a competitor for smart watches... It's a health tool and I have to admit it nailed that enough that I'm willing to pay for it. But I think if their competitors pulled their heads out of their asses for a day they could be quickly bringing the price down to something I'd be much happier with (like half..).That's all I've got. Owned the watch about a month, so take that into account. Will be watching for battery life degradation, or other malfunctioning.8-month Update:Time flies! I've been using this watch for a while now. The company continues to support data migration which I LOVE, big props to them for putting in the support work to make it easy to use MY data with whatever I want to! This is probably the one thing that will keep me coming back to this watch. Oh, and my original review has some outdated information - the watch IS supported now in Sleep for Android, and a lot of other apps that didn't support it at the time. Very cool having that compatibility across so many apps, I love to support this kind of product.They did a few firmware updates, not too many, and from what I can tell this improved the battery life in certain conditions (like in exercise modes). I do not like a recent update that added a ""feature"" to let you pause a workout, because I was used to just ending and restarting workouts whenever I needed and now I have to click through an extra screen to do that... but I see how others would want this. Overall I am really happy that they don't push out updates too often, but they are also clearly still constantly working on improvements! Great job.One complaint I almost had was the button - it started sticking and losing the tactile feel to it, which made navigating menus harder. I was really annoyed at this because it signals to me that gunk (probably from all my sweating) is getting IN the button and that could even cause it to stop functioning eventually. However, I solved this... in the shower (which I take the watch with me in) when I was washing up, I got the lathered soap as much into the button as I could then pressed it a lot to try to work it in, then rinsed it and pressed the button a bunch more to wash out the soap. Worked. Button is working again like it used to. For now. Hopefully doing that doesn't do any damage long term to the watch though.Oh, another complaint that other people have had. The watch face scratches easily. Mine has some nicks. =( Nothing that I can see without looking hard though, nothing functionally invasive. I've had plenty of surprised compliments from people who thought I was into the recent ""vintage/classic watch"" wearing fad, only to find out mine is actually fully functional! =)I also have recently purchased the Fenix 5 Sapphire watch from Garmin and can offer a comparison to this. An important note for comparison, on a black friday sale the Fenix dropped to $300. That's the deep sale price for it. While of course, this watch has (since I purchased it for $200.. =( ) has dropped to around $120-$150 in sale prices. So literally comparing a watch that costs nearly twice as much. But still. The Fenix glass does not scratch almost at all, where this watch absolutely does. The Fenix is also a better HR tracker, sad to say. During heavy exercise I notice sometimes they both can run into issues losing tracking for a bit (usually cleared up by swiping sweat away from the sensor, or moving the watch around), it happens a lot less with the Fenix. The Fenix has great battery life too and does not drain nearly as fast during exercise tracking as this watch does. But Fenix also does not last as long in standby.Data sharing I have yet to really test on the Garmin either, and I'm worried because I know for sure they aren't as easy as Withings is for exporting data. So I still use both (yep, two watches...).Overall, still think this is a great value HR tracking watch, especially at the new sale prices."
141,JL,5,the United States ,5-Dec-18,"Great for my Personal Needs, but Avoid the Black Steel and Steel HR Sport","A lot of my friends have smartwatches, but I just did not have a desire to own one, as I liked how traditional watches looked, and I did not need all the bells and whistles an Apple Watch offered. I also was turned off by the need to charge my phone every 1-2 days.Frankly, I wanted something that looked like a normal watch, but that could give me very basic notifications - calls, texts, work e-mails, and alarms. I didn't need Facebook, Twitter or third party notifications; steps, heart rate, sleep tracking, etc., were great, but, again, they were not must-haves for me. My phone is often on silent/vibrate, and, when the phone is in my pocket, I often don't feel the phone vibrate. Given my office job, I also don't like having my ringer set too high and causing a disruption.For a year or so, I wore a traditional time piece on my left wrist, while wearing a Xiaomi Mi Band 2 on my right wrist, as the Mi Band worked well for notifications and alarms. However, I finally decided I'd prefer to just wear one device - preferably something resembling a watch - so I started looking into products that would address my very specific preferences.At first, I was interested in the Chronos and Trivoly, two companies that made smart disks that attached to the bottom of your analog watch, and which would provide vibrating notifications. However, the reviews for both products looked terrible, and it appears both companies are dead in the water.  I also looked at smart watch straps, but those companies also failed to bring their products to market.After doing some research, I zeroed in on hybrid smartwatches. At first, I tried out two Skagen hybrids - the Jorn and the the Hagen (my local TJ Maxx had them for less than $75). I liked that they looked like normal, analog watches, and they were powered by a battery that needed to be replaced every 4-6 months. While some reviews complained the watches did not give you any indication what the notification was for, I felt like this was a reasonable tradeoff - I'd have a watch that was a watch first, but which provided notifications, even though I would not initially know what that notification was, i.e., I'd still have to pull my phone out of my pocket.However, while they are made by the same company and ran the same software, the Jorn did not have an alarm feature. More importantly, I felt like the vibration motor on both Skagens was so weak that, unless I was expecting a call, text or email, I would miss the notification altogether. This defeated the purpose of buying a hybrid smartwatch. I also considered other hybrids made by Fossil, but preferred a more conservative and cleaner watch face.I also considered the Garmin Vivomove HR, along with hybrid smartwatches by Martian, but I was turned off by the reviews, and I was not a fan of the designs. I also considered a company called Kronaby, but I did not feel comfortable spending $350+ for a piece of technology from a company I had never heard of.Enter Withings/Nokia. I loved the way they looked, but I had disregarded it in the past because their original product, the Steel, did not have notifications. This changed with the Steel HR and the Steel HR Sport. First, I preferred a 40mm face, which eliminated 2 of the 3 versions of the Steel HR that have 36mm faces. The 40mm version of the Steel HR only came with a black face, while both versions of the Steel HR Sport had 40mm faces, and came in both black and white. What's also great is that the Steel HR and Steel HR sport have this discrete screen that show notifications.At first, I thought the black-faced watch would look better, and it would conceal the notification screen better.  However, while the black Steel HR and Steel HR Sport do conceal the notification screen, I found the hour and minute markings to be too light, and the hour and minute hands to be too thin. This really became a problem if I was trying to read the time in anything but direct light. Basically, with the black-faced watches, they were unreadable in anything but direct light. As a lot of the reviews have stated, this is due to how reflective that mineral glass is. In addition, I felt like the minute and hour markers on the Steel HR (the straight lines) were so light that it was hard to tell time. Though I might be wrong, I suspected it would be hard to tell time even with the white-faced 36mm Steel HR.I thought that the white-faced Steel HR Sport would not look as good as the black one, but my presumption turned out to be wrong. I've only had the white Steel HR sport for about two weeks,  but I am loving it. It looks like a classic watch, and I get call, text,  work e-mail notifications, and alarms. Unlike the black-faced Steel HR and Steel HR Sport, the time is easy to read. It's still hard to read the time in darkness, as there's no lume on the hands, but the readability of the white-faced watch is significantly better than that of the black-faced watch.In addition, the product's battery is supposed to last up to 25 days. Two weeks after fully charging the watch, the app tells me the battery is at 61%. Not bad, though I also have not yet used the watch for workouts of any kind.As an added bonus, this watch uses a standard (and very common) 20mm watch band, so I replaced the perforated silicone sport band w/ a brown leather band, which goes well with my typical business casual work attire.A number of reviews complained about how easily scratched the mineral glass is. Since I've only owned the watch approximately two weeks, I have not noticed any scratches. However, I also bought a screen protector to prevent future scratches (IQ Shield brand).Time will tell how durable the Steel HR Sport is. While I tend to be very cautious with anything I buy, I am not going to be terribly upset if the watch lasts a year or two, as I paid $150 after tax (through Amazon Warehouse).So, in summation, I recommend the Steel HR Sport, but only in white."
142,RK,5,the United States ,2-Jul-22,"Real watch, digital health","There are several reviews here worth noting, a couple in German. I recommend if you are an English speaker, you hit the translate button because they are very thorough reviews. I lived in Germany for twenty years, if a discerning German gives five stars you better believe it.Until yesterday, I was a loyal fitbit-er. My wife bought a Withings scale and I had never heard of this company. When I went to the site for Withings, I realized they make a real watch with Fitbit style features (and more). I am a fan of quality timepieces, I have a Tag Heuer Carrera and an old Rolex, and a German made Junkers.  I truly missed a traditional round 38-48mm analog watch face. When I saw that Withings made most of their trackers like this, I got pretty excited. After research, I settled on the Sport HR. Amazon got it to my doorstep in almost 12 hours(!). I had it charged in an hour, 100%.I am impressed with the features and how you can tailor the readings and also notifications. It took me about an hour at the most to figure out most of the features. After reading some negative comments, I can safely say my watch face is not canted as some have stated. Honestly, if it were as one person pointed out, I wouldn’t have worried about it as my days of synchronizing times for mission regaled issues or measuring compass directions are long over (I was an infantryman for 24 years, long since retired). Besides, you can do all of that with either your phone, the app or both. You can set an alarm and timer on your watch if you wish, and also GPS track on apple or google maps. So far, this watch does everything that my versa2 could do, but better.Now, to visibility. I chose the black, as white watch faces are nice, but too bright for me, may be the old tactical grunt in me not sure. I was a little worried about glare, etc. so, here’s my take. You can see it great in bright sunlight. In shade, background light makes it difficult. In a dark room, also difficult. If you angle it a little, light will catch on the hands. But if you have difficulty seeing the hands, you simply press the button and have a digital time, super easy to see (I don’t even need my cheaters!). So, it’s best of both worlds, in rather extreme lighting situation, something I can’t say for my old Versa. Also, it connects to my IPAD of IPhone App much better than my Fitbit did. Great information, and I prefer using the button to scroll through time, date, heart rate, steps, etc, etc. finally, it’s a great looking watch, my most favorite watch since my wife gave me my Tag sixteen years ago. I bought a leather band too, and it looks great, will probably use that for work.I highly recommend this tracker. If you are concerned about the face being difficult to read, I would go with the white face, but I would get black if I had to do it over again. I never could find a Fitbit I was truly happy with, this is what I had always hoped for; a tracker that looks like a real watch, and a very nice watch at that. I am 61, my wife about four years younger and we are getting serious about our health and it seems Withings may have people like us in mind. Never been a smart/iwatch kind of a person, but really like tracking heart rate, step, weight, etc, etc, and this Sport HR is the perfect blend."
143,Gustavo Alvarez,5,the United States ,1-Oct-20,"Honestly, one of my favorite pieces of tech EVER.","I absolutely love this watch and the companion app. This watch and compamy should get way more recognition and praise in an era where people only care about Apple Watches.I found out about these watches because I purchased a Withingd smart scale and I was very pleased  (and surprise) with their Health iPhone app. I had also recently got rid of my Apple Watch and I wanted to check other smart watches. The reason I got rid of my Apple Watch and I had pretty much given up on smart watches, was because they did 'too much', too many notifications, distractions and another piece of tech I have to charge EVERY DAY. So when I read that this watch could last for a whole month and tracked your sleep I was very surprised and I wanted to give it a shot and let me tell you, this watch delivered.Things I love:-Design and built quality. It doesn't feel cheap at all. The vessel, glass, button everything feels of high quality and it doesn't even look like a smart watch.8/10-Battery Life: As advertised, full month. I wear it all day including at night track your sleep (which I could never do with the Apple Watch), heart rate and fitness activity.  Finally a decent smart watch that can also deliver some notifications (I pretty much only have calls and calendar notification turned on) without having to charge it everyday... seriously, once a month even if you use it to track your workouts 3-4 times a week.10/10- APP APP APP.  A good smartwach without a decent app is half way good. Seriously, the Health app keeps getting better and better with every update. Download it before buying the watch and check it out by yourself. The interface is clean and very well designed, all important information is right there with your average and trends + your weight (if you have the scale). Much better than the Health app from Apple in my opinion. Also, it imports/exports your health information from the Apple Health App both ways so if you end up getting rid of the watch all the fitness/health information from your watch stays with you in your phone. 9/10-Functionality/Accuracy: Again, less is more. You can check your BPM, steps, walked miles, alarm, mute a call, etc just by pressing the side (and single) button. Hold press to start a work out, stopwatch that's it. Also, since I wear it at night to track my sleep I use the alarm on the watch which just makes the watch vibrate so you don't wake up your partner and you also have a more pleasant time in the morning than listening to the alarm on your phone.The sleep tracking functionality is very accurate and tells you how many interruptions, how deep your sleep was, etc. Stepscount, distance, BPM work perfectly9/10Thins I would change/don't like:-The rubber band gave me a little bit of a allergy reaction. My mom and sister also had some sort of skin reaction with their rubber bands but nothing major. They should find a different material-The charger, it's ok. I just wish it was a wireless charger so I could use any kind of charger. It is proprietary so you are stuck with their chargesSide note:I see people here complaining about their customer service. I haven't had any bad experiences. I had an issue with the button on the watch that used to get stuck and I reached out to them and they sent me a label to ship it back and they sent me a new one with another charger and band (they let me keep the other band and charger) so no problems at all."
144,Samuel Patton,5,the United States ,27-Nov-22,Good,Works well in all respects.  Good battery life app and tracking.
145,Kareem Cox,5,the United States ,7-Oct-22,Everything I expected,"It took me a long time to buy a smart watch. I wanted something with a classic look, but with health tracking. I researched tons of watches before I settled on this bad boy. Love it! I went ahead and got another model in a different colour for myself as well. Watch lovers stare at my wrist all the time trying to figure out what it is. Perfect blend of style and functionality."
146,Just Jim,5,the United States ,15-Nov-20,Good fitness tracker but also consider the Pulse HR at less cost,"I should have saved a few dollars and bought the next model lower down. I don't use VO2 Max as my idea of excercise is walking and not running. I find that this watch and the app are really good. The step counter is accurate during a workout but it does not update the count much if you are just puttering around the house. I mostly wanted this watch for the heart rate, sleep function, and the exercises it monitors. Much of the watch concerns the ""watch"" itself. Personally, I find it very difficult to see the hands. I tried the white watch and the black watch. Both are not much for being able to sneak a look at your watch to tell the time. I always have to push the button to tell the time. It has something to do with the slender and shiny hands and the many reflections on the crystal. Really hard to see. Having complained about that, let's talk about battery life. It is fantastic. Almost a month of life. Maybe only two weeks if you press the buttons a lot but that is still excellent. The app is fantastic and integrates well with all the Withings device I own. It reports on every bit of data it collects. I like that the sleep function works well and that heart rate is recorded while sleeping. The smart alarm for wakeup is also nice and it works. Some have complained that the watch buzz is too gentle but I am the type of person who is almost always awake when the alarm goes off, anyway, so it does not matter to me. I also have a fancy and expensive Galaxy watch 3 which does all sorts of fun stuff. However, when you boil it down to the basics, the Withings does all the exercise monitoring as well as sleep monitoring better, in my opinion, than the Samsung. Bear in mind the Galaxy watch is a full-fledged smartwatch while the Withings is basically a fitness tracker. I do recommend this watch but if you want to save money and stay in the Withings domain, just get the Pulse HR instead."
147,Top Contributor: Photography,5,the United States ,26-Feb-19,"Looks great, works well!","I've had my Withings Steel HR Sport Smartwatch for about 4 months, and so far I'm very pleased. There are some negatives, and here are the pros and cons:Pro:* I love the black on black styling - looks great!* Four months in, the watch looks like new. No scratches, no scuff marks! My previous watch was the second generation Apple Watch, and it showed a lot more wear and tear.* The battery life I am getting is 18 - 20 days, using its features pretty often. Not quite what was advertised, but still a huge improvement over the one day from my Apple Watch. I can now charge my watch and then go on a one or two week business trip without needing to bring my charger.* I bought the optional tan (brown?) leather band, which I wear to work, and it looks great! Its very easy to replace the watch bands - takes me about 15 seconds, so I switch back to the silicone band (which came with the watch) when doing exercise.* I like the small dial on the bottom of the watch face that uses an analog hand to measure steps taken. Just a quick glance down, and I can see my progress.* Sychs great with the Withings Health Mate App on my iphone XS Max. (Full disclosure, I also own the Withings smart scale, blood pressure monitor, and thermometer. The Health Mate App is easy to use, and I have my entire family on the app so I can monitor my kids temperatures when they are sick, etc.)* Seems to do a good job of measuring my Heart Rate most of the time, as well as my sleep cycles.Negatives:* Black on black watch face is difficult to read in dim light, and impossible when it begins to get dark. Pushing the crown button, though, activates the LED which immediately provides the date and time.* Calculated calories burnt during activities varies significantly. For example, I do the same 45 minute work-out routine, one day apart. The first one read a calorie burn of 420, the second of 180!* The watch calculates total calories burned during the course of the day, but this is not recorded in the Health Mate App! That should be an easy fix for Withings...Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase! I paid $199 on Amazon, significantly less then Apple Watch, Garmin, etc. (although admittedly they have greater functionality, but I didn't want / need those extra functions). It looks like I am wearing a cool, professional watch, not a computer on my wrist! I would definitely purchase the watch again."
148,JP Cooper,5,the United States ,12-Jul-22,Excellent buy,"Whiting Steel HR SportSo far this watch has been the best fitness watch that I have ever owned.  It's stylish and doesn’t look like the average fitness watch.  It does everything that I need it to do and more.It keeps track of my heart rate, steps, calories and miles.  The battery stays charge during regular use for about 30 days before the battery goes down to zero.Once the battery reaches zero, the watch enter into power reserve mode.  In power reserve mode all functions are disabled except for the analog watch,  which continues to function for an unknown duration of time.I highly recommend this watch to anyone desiring to have a stylish fitness (workout) watch that gets the job done and doesn’t need to be charged every 24 to 72 hours."
149,Crials,5,the United States ,1-Jul-21,Durable and Works Perfectly after 6th Months of Daily Use,"I've been using this watch daily for 6 months now and have no complaints. It's held up to running, working out, salt water fishing, and some wood working. A screen protector has kept the face scratch free. Time keeping is accurate, and the step-counter dial is very convenient. I don't personally use the watch for phone notifications, but when I did my only complaint was that there was no way to turn off the watch notifications just for when you were sleeping, you had to disable them and hen re-enable in the morning. The vibrating alarm would work well for a light sleeper but I typically sleep through it. I'm using the rubber band that came with it and it fits tightly for accurate heart rate readings during exercise, but is also very comfortable. The watch itself looks nice enough to wear to work, especially if you were to dress it up with one of the other bands that Withings sells. The bands have the quick remove lever to easily change them out. The band did get a bit dull in color pretty quickly, I think some outer layer wore off, but it still looks good. Battery life is incredibly long even when using it regularly in activity tracking mode, and it charges up very quickly and easily. The app is very user friendly and links to many other common health apps. The built in running and cycling trackers use phone GPS very accurately and the app makes it very easy to track and view your runs. There's no built in way to track your water intake or calories/macros, but it can link to apps that do track those things. Overall an excellent purchase well worth the money as a watch that can be worn in any setting."

151,Muhammad,1,the United States ,27-Nov-22,Misleading Description - does not measure blood pressure.,"In the description it says the watch measures blood pressure, and this was the one feature i was interested in when I purchased this watch. Turns out, it only has a heart rate monitor and if you are interested in systolic/diastolic blood pressure measurements, it does not capture those. So look else where."
152,Desiree,1,the United States ,9-Sep-22,Something shady is going on,"****DO NOT BUY THIS SMART WATCH**** - First of all i would like to start off by saying that 90% of the listing reviews for the Portzon Smart Watch are actually for what looks like a pair of standard 5lb dumbbells.  Which given the current price of 69.99 I think we can all agree that price doesn't match.The watch itself looks like your typical 3rd party smart watch until you dive a little deeper. The only way to pair this watch to your phone (android or apple) is by using your camera and scanning a QR code which will send you to a private Chinese website with a link to an app to download.  You cannot simply use Bluetooth as it requires your location in order to register even if you sync the watch with your phone prior to downloading the app. This took my Samsung phone nearly 15 tries to get the correct response from the QR code. Upon the first few tries it just gave me random numbers or wouldn't connect to the site.  Because i couldn't get the watch to connect to my phone i couldn't even change the date or time. All of this is done through the app and the watch itself is just a place holder.The App -The weight limit when creating your profile only goes up to 213 lbs / 96 kg. If you weigh more than this too bad and thus all the information you'll be gathering will be inaccurate.  Your height is measured in Inches and doesn't go above 6ft. Unless you allow ALL permissions which include some of the following. Location, phone calls, and contacts as well as permission to connect to other devices and gather data.  You will NOT be able to use this app which leaves the watch pretty much useless.Due to all the extra allowances that the watch & it's unrelated (by name) app require as well as the inaccurate Amazon listing and Manufacture name. I opted to go no further during the setup. I've owned a few different types of smart watches over the years and none of them were this restrictive.  0-5 If you can't be honest with your customers you can't expect people to like your product."
153,A. Crowe,1,the United States ,13-Sep-22,Buyer beware! Good reviews are for dumbbells not this watch.,"The 2000+ reviews you are seeing that are 5 star is for dumb bells!!!! See my pic or click reviews and read some.  This watch is garbage, actually 0 stars. The only thing it might be good for is checking the time, but i wouldn't even trust it to do that correctly. Won't stay connected to iPhone. Doesn't display correct temperature, example I was outside working in the heat, went to check temperature and it said 66 degrees. When I checked the weather on my phone it said 94. Oxygen sensor pretends its working but doesn't match up with a finger oxygen reader. This is a very deceiving ad in my opinion."
154,shaheem jackson,1,the United States ,10-Oct-22,Tells time pretty well but that's about it.,It refused to stay linked to my device even when is close proximity.None of the companies suggested fixes helped but did suggest they're pretty aware of the pairing problem.The functionality of the watch itself was questionable right out the box as some features like the heart rate monitor were not functional/accessible.I do not recommend this watch.
155,DGrim,2,the United States ,14-Nov-22,Not worth the trouble,"I like a lot of the features of this watch, but the band is eating up my wrist and a replacement doesnt seem possible. I cannot wear it, my skin is bruised and peeling. I dont wear it too tight and its removed daily to shower. It also is constantly trying to pair with my phone and is either answering calls to the watch when I dont want it to or disconnected when Im trying to find my phone or control music."
156,S. Declue,2,the United States ,14-Jan-22,Inferior quality,I purchased these two weeks ago to use in our winter home. One of them is already damaged and I’ve only used them 3 times. How could it split so soon?  The room I use them in is carpeted. I’m very disappointed in the quality.
157,KT,2,the United States ,21-Feb-22,Poor quality,Have used the weights for a couple of weeks and the covering is already falling apart.
158,MDP,2,the United States ,30-Oct-22,"Looks nice enough, but ...","I got this for my son to use. He's a big guy who's been working out a lot and I thought this would be a useful tool for him. He was pretty stoked when I gave it to him. The watch looks the same as most smart watches you've seen, but when it comes to function, there are serious issues. He cannot get it to correctly calculate any of his stats. He did all of the setup and says the app is really bad and that the watch use pretty much useless to him. I would not recommend."
159,Paul/Marina,2,the United States ,30-Oct-22,Don't bother,"We may have just got a dud but this watch is useless. Battery life isn't long, doesn't track steps well and sleep tracker was way off."
160,Jon Groubert,2,the United States ,13-Sep-22,"This is my second ""cheap"" SmartWatch, and it's not ready for primetime - back to Amazon it goes","This is the second ""smartwatch"" I've ordered in a month.  I returned the first one; and I'm returning this one, too.This one is definitely much better than the first, as it is easy to use and intuitive.  I would give it four stars if that was the end of it.The problem is that it is supposed to activate and light up when I flip the watch up towards my face.  It does not.  I have the settings on for it to do so.  I even reset the watch to factory settings and set it again.  It still doesn't turn on.  It needs to so automatically, not when it feels like, or only after I've made the wrist motion half a dozen times at different speeds.  Forget it.  I don't want a watch that needs two hands to view.If that doesn't bother you, then this is a decent enough watch for the price to buy, wear, and use.  However, it certainly bothers me, so it's useless.  Back to Amazon it goes."
161,Mark C.,2,the United States ,14-Sep-22,"TERRIBLE interface, making many features useless","I really wanted to like this, but its interface SUCKS. For example, the timer seems to include only PRE-SET units of time, & if you leave the timer screen & want to go back to see how much time is left, you're out of luck.This needs some way switch easily between apps that are running...& if there is one, it's hidden so well I couldn't find it.Would not but again."
162,Dr. Jones,2,the United States ,16-Sep-22,"Watch is good, the app is terrible","The watch itself works great. It measures all the health metrics it's supposed to. I have had the worst luck with the app though. Half of the app's options don't work, including the feedback part. I had to track down the developer email through Google Play to try to some resolution and then use Translate because they are in China. Sometimes you get what you pay for."
163,bobo24601,3,the United States ,7-Dec-22,DOES NOT capture blood pressure.,"Contrary to item splash page this does NOT capture blood pressure. Rated ""3"" because I assume otherwise it might work acceptably."
164,Vivian,3,the United States ,28-Oct-20,Not recommended but in a reasonable price,"Honestly, the pairs of dumbbells are much THICKER than any other I used before. Besides, the handle not comfortable for me to holding up. I brought a pair of 5LB but not reaching my expectations cuz the quality is not good. Not recommended but for the reasonable price I would like to keep them."
165,Emma Southee,3,the United States ,19-Oct-22,App won't connect anymore,"I was waiting to review this until I figured out how to get the weather to work on the watch face.But now the app won't connect to it at all.  I had liked that you could use a code on the watch and scanning it from your phone would pull it up but now it just gets stuck on a connecting screen and locks up.SO I never figured out how to set the weather.  BUT I did like the other features.  I wore it in tandem with my fitbit on the other arm.  The BPM on both was similar.  The step count was  little lower on this one then he fitbit, but they were in the same area.I do like that this also does temp, oxygen, blood pressure, has a flashlight etc.  I really like the different displays and the ease of navigating through different features.But now I can't get it to connect to anything, or maybe its just the app, unsure."
166,MWZ,3,the United States ,19-Sep-22,"Nice in many ways, but falls short","I've had quite a few smart watches, some expensive, some in between and some inexpensive.  I wouldn't compare the Portzon to a Samsung or Apple watch.  But I've had sub $100 watches so that is my point of comparison.  In terms of my expectations, I mostly want the correct time, notifications, step counting, countdown timer, and a reliable alarm clock.  It has to do all of these things well or it's not very useful to me.  Sleep tracking is useful if it's good, but not necessary.  I mostly hike for exercise so other sports don't count much for me, but the sports this watch specifically tracks are useful for me.There are many things to like about this watch:The case is metal, not plastic.It uses standard watch bands.The face is large and bright, and there are a lot of available faces.It tracks sports: Cycling, Walking, Elliptical machine.  These are all useful to me.It has a function to record a woman's cycle.  Not useful for me but might be for some.I checked the blood oxygen, heart rate, blood pressure and temperature measurements, all of which are reasonably accurate, especially for tracking trends.The Android phone app is well organized and easy to use.  The graphs and data it presents are well done and easy to read.The battery life is good, 5 to 7 days or so with the full time measurements turned on, it would be longer with them off.  It also charges quickly.But there are issues.It will not stay paired with my phone.  It will pair again if I restart the app (although this fails sometimes).  It has the all the necessary permissions, and its background services are running, but it just doesn't stay paired.  For this reason notifications don't work.  When I start the app, it usually pairs again, but I have to click twice on the phone and another twice on the watch to complete the process.  Occasionally pairing fails and I have to go through the process of manually pairing.When set for 12 Hour time, it registers 00 hours rather than 12 between noon and 1 pm.The watch lets you assign shortcuts that you get to with a right swipe.  This is nice,  but not all of the functions are available for this, including the timers, alarm, and notifications.  Functions not in the favorites are available in a menu you get to with a left swipe.  But it takes 5 up swipes to go through the whole list which can't be edited or reordered.  So the functions I use most are 5 to 7 swipes from he main screen.For me the pairing issue is a deal killer since notifications are a must have.  Likewise the difficulty of getting to the functions I use most is a problem.  Its possible that future software releases could fix these problems, it might be OK in the future.  The watch is running V1.15, the phone Android 12.  If you are reading this review in a few weeks or months from now it would be worth checking to see if these issues have been corrected.  it's a nice watch, but just doesn't make it for me."
167,Amazon Customer,3,the United States ,18-Sep-22,Has Pros and Cons,"I definitely have some concerns with this watch including the fact that the majority of the reviews shown are for dumbbells.  I looked at a similar watch from the same company and the reviews were mostly for ping pong balls so right off the bat things seem a little untrustworthy. Then when you scan the barcode provided to get the app needed to work with your watch, it goes to a foreign website with a link to download the app.  I definitely wasn't clicking that link so I searched and downloaded the app directly from the Google Playstore and used it that way.I have a brand name watch that is a bulkier watch that has a casual appearance, so I liked that this watch has a more sleek appearance and I can wear it for all occasions. The watch fits well and is comfortable and is easy to adjust. There are over 100 smart dials you can pick from the app so you can definitely find one you like. I did not have an issue pairing the watch to my google phone, but I had a lot of issues keeping it paired which is not something I have experienced with other smart watches. It appears if you have the watch and phone too far apart you will need to pair the watch to the phone again. Since I keep my watch on my desk when I sleep at night and my phone next to my bed, I have to pair the watch and phone every morning. There are the usual settings for your personal goals and units you want the watch to report in and track and it appears to do that pretty well for the most part. I wore this watch to the doctor's office and the measurements he took did match the ones I was able to track on my watch. I did have an issue with getting the watch to report the weather though. I have to go in and turn off weather notifications and turn them back on to get the weather to appear on my watch again even temporarily.I really wanted to like this smart watch but due to issues keeping the phone paired, issues with receiving notifications and reporting on some metrics like the weather, and the fact that I struggle with the overall trust factor with this company, I would personally suggest looking elsewhere."
168,JOSE EMANUEL GAZZANO SENDRA,3,the United States ,2-Oct-22,It's not making my life easier and that is what counts,"Great hardware, looks super sleek and thin, you can see it next to my other smartwatch. Also very precise on the readings. Battery life is meh, maybe 5 days top. Very comfortable. The display is not too shiny and not high definition.I would be happy with all this, because of the price, but the first thing I noticed when I wore it is that finding the angle to have it turn on and give me the hour was something I had to train myself for. Then conectivity, it just keeps disconnecting and it doesn't reconnect seamlessly like others, that's annoying. And last, if you're on a menu and lower your arm and come back later, instead of showing you the main face, it just stays on that menu and you have to scroll back, but when you are on the stopwatch it turns off instead of staying on, and I'm working on my chest bench and instead of just looking at it I have to press the button because I will never find the angle to make it turn on while on that possition.Ah, one more, there are some notifications options, but not for every app you have in your phone, say gmail, and if you activate all the notifications and you have the gps, the watch won't stop vibrating.How come the developers didn't see all this? looks like they don't use their own products.Comming from my Touchelex Venus all this nuances seem nonsense for an item that calls itself smart.Hope I gave you a good panorama and this was helpful."
169,Timothy Watts,3,the United States ,13-Oct-22,I wanted this watch to be as good as it says it is in the literature,"I have some medical issues that scars my wife for me to be alone at home during the day. I have been looking for a watch that has some basic functions and a few expanded functions. To start with I wanted my watch to give me text messages I received on my phone to the watch at a glance. I needed the watch to be comfortable and not aggravate my wrist while wearing it. I needed the watch to do some basic checks like O2 sensor, heart rate monitor, and measure and keep a running tallie of my BP. Other functions I would like to have were notifications from different apps on my phone with the ability to accept or reject phone calls and other notifications delivered to my phone on the watch.So I want to start with the features the watch does have. The watch can keep track of your O2, Heart rate, Blood Pressure , and sleep rate information. Most of these are somewhat accurate, as I regularly compare them to the results taken at doctors appointments and during periodic checks against my dialysis machine during treatments. For the most part when those are checked I have a good round number to make sure I do not drop too low or go too high. Now the watch for the most part is comfortable. It has a plastic type band and since I have large wrists it can get sticky from time to time but not anything to complain about. The run time for the watch is just about a week with one exception where I took the watch off the charger and we went to dinner and before I returned home (3 hours later) the watch battery had run down and shut off the watch. It happened once and I am not sure why.So when the watch connects to my phone it will update the medical functions allowing me to see a graph of how my body functions over time. But only when it connects to the phone which is a manual function to get it connected and you have to accept the connection each and every time. Sometimes it stays connected for a day or so and there times I have to reconnect it to the phone multiple times each hour. When it connects I get a bulk list of the last 2 or 3 emails and text messages but I am unable to open them from the watch and see what  was written. Nore am I able to reply to them from my watch. It does not allow you to accept or reject calls, or realy have the ability to do anything from the watch that would make the phone do anything at all.Now of the truly disappointing features the ad had in it . The Biggest thing I have not been able to start/find/make work is the ability for running tallie for ECG. This is the main function I wanted/needed in purchasing a new watch. Medically I was looking for a device which could keep that running data without having p weare a monitoring device provided by my doc. I know it would not be considered accurate but with the ability to identify times and or situations when my heart might be causing me to have issues. The other thing I would have to work on was the fall monitor. Because of the heart and medical issues I tend to fall a lot. This feature would have helped my wife to know if I fell during the day and whether I needed someone to come and help me get upI know these features are not for use as a medical device,but it would help me identify issues and what was going on when I felt this way.To sum up, the watch is comfortable, it has a decent screen resolution and can be seen clearly. The heart monitor , the blood pressure, O2 rate ,  temperature, and sleep monitor are good functions and for the most part fairly accurate. The downside is some of the functions I would like to be available like ECG, fall monitor are non existent along with normal functions like keeping connection to the phone , ability to make take and close phone calls, and the inability to see a text other than the headline as the same with emails and several other notifications the phone gives throughout the day.If you are looking for a watch that can give you an idea of what is going on and one that can count your steps and not connect to the phone for calls, responding to texts, IM, DM, or phone calls then I think you will like this watch.."
170,Top Reviewer,3,the United States ,11-Sep-22,Not very useful,"Although it shows messages and emails as they come in, I could not find a way to scroll through and see more than the snippet it displays. About the only thing it does well is the heart rate monitor."
171,Lena,4,the United States ,11-May-22,Just what I needed,I love the grip and they are easy to store and easy to access. You can get a quick round of reps in at anytime (I keep mine in the kitchen) Very pretty color too! My son even likes them. They are heavy enough and get the job done!
172,Lindsay,4,the United States ,22-May-22,It’s useful,"Love it, after I get this one, it’s useful for my arm exercise and I almost do it three days a week"
173,Janey,4,the United States ,11-Mar-21,Basic dumbbells for a good price,These didn’t fit my hands well so I returned them. The return got lost but I was able to contact Amazon and they did issue a refund for me.
174,KES,4,the United States ,16-Nov-22,Practical Smart Watch,"This smart watch was to replace a conventional watch which broke and a Fitbit tracker. In both respects it has worked very well. To connect to my Android phone, it is necessary to turn on Bluetooth and Location on my phone since I normally keep these turned off. But there never is a problem connecting and updating my data. There are some functions that I do not use, but I can see that they are potentially useful. For example, there is a reminder to take 100 steps if I sit too long.Initially the watch gave a “ding” when it wanted my attention. By engaging “Do not disturb,” I changed that so that now it gives a slight buzz, which is far less intrusive. One problem I had was the face lighting up at night when I moved. This was fixed by turning off  “Lift your wrist to light up the screen.” This can be done on the watch alone each evening, but I do not bother ever turning on the “Lift” option. I was disappointed that programming the “Do Not Disturb mode” to be on automatically for a fixed period each night did not solve the problem, nor did enabling “Automatic brightness at night.”The night-time issue has been the only problem. There is a pleasant analog watch face available, which I use, but there are many more options, displaying different choices of information. An easily used flashlight feature is included. In the few months I have used this watch, I have found that it was accurate and easy to use, once you are willing to experiment with the phone software. Battery charges last over a week. The printed sheet included in the packaging gave little information. In the phone software there is a “How to use” option. There it is explained how to make and receive calls on the watch, but that is not a feature that I have used.In conclusion, this watch has functioned well and done what I desired."
175,Christopher S,4,the United States ,1-Nov-22,Works as expected and less expensive than most of the competition,My wife wore a Fitbit for about a year. The bands would only last a few months and then we had to struggle to get the band release to work to install a replacement. The plastic finally broke to the point that a new band couldn't be installed. About the same time the screen stopped working. The whole thing gave the impression that it was a throwaway device. She then moved to a Samsung Watch which synced to her Samsung phone. I was interested in something that had a combination of the features of the two but at a reasonable cost. This watch fits that niche perfectly. It's constructed much better than the Fitbit having a metal case with easily swappable standard bands. The battery lasts a whole week where my wife needs to charge her Samsung watch every other day. The Runmefit app that pairs with it has most of the features that similar apps have and syncs easily with my Samsung phone. I work in a hospital and was surprised to see how closely the blood oxygen and blood pressure indicated by the watch matches those taken by dedicated medical equipment. I'm pretty tough on watches but this is holding up well. There are still no scratches on the screen and the band is as good as new. I may replace the included rubber band with a cloth or leather strap but that is easy to do as it's a standard 22mm band.
176,Zhufff,4,the United States ,26-Nov-22,Smart watch. Needs smart phone to update clock,I ordered this smart watch for my child who really wanted a watch that also tracked heart rate and steps like others they've seen.  The kids watches we have don't track heart rate.This one won't tell me anything outside of time and heart rate without connecting it to a smart phone. I can't even correct the time on the watch without a smart phone connection.It does come with the wireless magnetic charger and lasts weeks between charges so far.
177,Sean Chiccino,4,the United States ,7-Nov-22,this watch legit lasted 2 whole weeks between charges,"the battery life on this thing is unbelievable. like, it never died lol. over 2 weeks between charges. idk how well the fitness tracking stuff works, didnt use it much. i was just using it as a watch/calender. many cool faces on the watch to suit your style. works great. but you get what you pay for with these things. it def feels cheap and isnt super comfy"
178,J. Dawson,4,the United States ,20-Oct-22,A very nice sports watch (Round GLR8),"I have the round model GLR8.  I use this watch for calls, my calendar and texting.  I also use the alarm feature.I also really like the heart rate monitor and activity tracker.  I found that the heart rate is accurate.  I have not yet tried to monitor my sleep with the watch, I already know that I am not sleeping well!The TFT-LCD full touch screen is just over an inch in diameter and the watch is water resistant.  (I have worn mine in heavy rain).I found that the music was so-so, but there are other great features like GPS, remote control for your phone camera, stopwatch and an easy to use timer.  I was at full charge in about 2 and a half hours.  And the watch stayed charged enough to work, for about 5 days.You can choose different watch faces, and many are option dependent (such as the one that emphasizes calories burned and number of steps).Overall I think the watch is very well made and is a very good value for the price."
179,Debra Brinkman,4,the United States ,19-Sep-22,Controls are easy to understand,"I got this for my husband.  This is his review:The band is fairly comfortable. I have a pretty large wrist, 9"" (22.5cm), and this band fits using the very last hole. The black silicon band has a little give so even my wrist has a little ""wiggle room"" to move around slightly.Setup was straight forward. The unit includes a magnetic charging pigtail with a USB A plug on it. My unit came with a little charge on it but I left it charging for a while before use to avoid possible complications during setup. Of course, like most things these days, you have to use their app to get it working correctly. The app is easy to find and download with the included QR code.Controls are pretty easy to understand once you have gone through the instructions. There is only one button but it has several functions. Many of the features are dependent on pairing with a cell phone. This pairing is all done through the app. Do not try to pair it through your device's bluetooth menu or it gets confused.First, there are several watch faces to choose from, many free and some paid. Everything from flashy and artistic to plain and simple. They also show a wide variety of data sets depending on your preferences, of course date/time, hands vs digital, battery level, health, weather, steps, etc.A lot of the functionality is geared toward health. Heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen, exercise tracking, step counting, sleep monitoring, stress monitoring, noise monitoring, activity monitoring, sedentary monitoring, breath training, and monitor monitoring (okay, I made that one up). The heart rate monitor is pretty accurate considering the numbers matched up with my dedicated Wahoo heart monitor.There are far too many functions to cover them all here but I will mention some of my favorites. Music control, send/receive calls, flashlight and timer. What I like the most though, is calendar notifications. If you set thing up correctly you can have the watch vibrate (or audible if you wish) to remind you of thing you put in your calendar (iCal on my phone).All-in-all, I like this watch and intend on getting a lot of use out of it."
180,Angel C,4,the United States ,3-Oct-22,Great Watch,"Compared to your average minimal smart watch on the market, this one is pretty good. The app is pretty generic but was easy to setup. The screen is a bit more responsive than most low end watches which is nice, battery life is pretty normal. I like that this watch uses quick release bands so you can use any band you own that has that specific kind of latch. The only complaint I have is that the band left a red mark on my wrist, I believe it was the quick release latch as I had red spots that peeled after a week. overall this is a nice smartwatch, I love the customizable face, although the default selections have nice animations and images available."
181,Rebecca Rodriguez,5,the United States ,1-Dec-22,My dream watch,I'm more than happy with my watch 😻

188,cbuell,5,the United States ,13-Apr-22,they are weights alright...,They are weights and they work as such. Seem to weigh the advertised weight so thats good... cool.
189,Lisa,5,the United States ,29-Mar-22,Best value!,I love the price and the color of these weights. They are easy to hold and that makes my workouts perfect.
190,mimitish,5,the United States ,24-Mar-22,great weights,Being older it is important to keep my arms toned I use the weights every other day to keep myself toned.
191,Nacomie,1,the United States ,31-Oct-22,Not at all what I really wanted,"Please pay attention to the details of the features and fuctions that you are really looking for in your wrist watch. This is not it. This is not smart, I wanted a smart watch this is universal, and multifunctional. That is not this. It is super basic and not at all waterproof. The sensor in reading your steps is extremely off and delayed significantly.  The text font is primitive, and their are not a lot of ways to personalize the device. The app is so basic and poorly constructed.  Way to complicated for no reason. I own a Samsung Galaxy S22 and it doesn't not sync with Samsung health. I really do not like this watch at all. I have stopped using it as it has sent electronical shocks shooting up my arm. I will not buy again and I do not recommend."
192,Jolie Nicodemus,1,the United States ,4-Mar-21,Not worth the money. GET A DIFFERENT BRAND!,"This product stinks. Literally and metaphorically. My package smelled like mildew and was wet. But I’m more upset at the fact that you can’t even see the amount of steps you’ve taken on your watch, you have to pull out your phone and look at you mobile app just to see how many steps you’ve taken. My touch pad is really glitchy, I’m assuming because it all got wet somehow.  I’m very dissatisfied and I actually went and purchased a different brand of smart watch because this is ridiculous. You can get a watch that has the same features but also tells you the weather, let’s you customize it, tells you your active heart rate on the watch, tells you your sleep patterns on the watch, and tells you how many steps you’ve taken on the watch instead of having to pull out your phone and looking on the app. All that an more for a little extra money. So yeah. I bought a different watch because this one sucks. And I can’t even give it to my little sister because it would do nothing but give her the time, she wouldn’t even know how many steps she took because she doesn’t have a phone to set up the app. So this watch is worthless."
193,Kayleah,1,the United States ,14-Nov-22,Wasn't able to call or message ppl on the watch like advertised,Wasn't able to call or message people on the watch like advertised only receives the alerts.
194,Karla ,1,the United States ,9-Sep-22,You get what you pay for,The first one broke within a week. The second died a slow death. The heart rate tracker quit first. Then it stopped communicating with my phone. Still tells time but not why I bought it. 1 or 5 stars is generous.
195,Hilda L.,1,the United States ,22-Nov-22,Jyst something looking like a watch but not a watch,"I totally dislike everything, this is not fair"
196,Jack Reilly,1,the United States ,28-Sep-22,not worth buying,worked fine for a few days then does not connect to phone You buy cheap you get cheap
197,JODEE,1,the United States ,25-Oct-22,Watch band discoloration,Watch band discoloration after a week!
198,Alina Garcia Montilla,1,the United States ,16-Oct-22,Just one month working. It’s a garbage.,It is not lasting on and don’t buy it.
199,Catherine Lenneman,1,the United States ,30-Jun-22,Not worth the money,Worked well for a couple months then stopped excepting Bluetooth.  Tried to get help from mobile app HA!  They don’t bother answering.  Apparently they new it had problems.  Not worth your money
200,Nicole C.,1,the United States ,23-Aug-22,great at first,This worked great for about a month(just past the return date) and now won't hold a charge.
201,Kindle Customer,2,the United States ,30-Oct-22,Doesn’t last long,"I purchased this watch in August and by the middle of September the screen had frozen to just showing the time. Now, at the end of October the screen is completely blank. The battery life was good and the watch was comfortable. The app showed good information and was easy to use. However, the quality of the watch is just not there. I will be switching to another brand."
202,Amazon Customer,2,the United States ,14-Oct-22,Order a dark color!,The light pink was super cute but it picks up every little bit of ink from your clothes or things you touch.  Second day wearing it and it’s perms a toy stained 😩.  Wish I just  ordered black
203,Joy ,2,the United States ,3-Feb-22,"Not great, most things don’t work like they’re supposed to","I’ve only had it for a couple days but it’s not great. The heart monitor doesn’t work the majority of the time. The step counter isn’t accurate, which I guess is kind of expected considering it tracks wrist movement but it was counting steps while I was laying in bed watching Netflix. The real part that frustrates me is that I don’t think the calorie counter is accurate. I mostly got this watch to count how many calories I was burning when I worked out. One of the exercises I do lasts 50 minutes and the people who do it always say they burn at least 500+ calories. After I completed it the watch had counted about 250. I’m pretty much able to keep up with the instructor, so I’m lead to believe that the watch simply isn’t reporting all of the calories that I’m burning because I see no reason that I would actually burn only half of the calories that every other person who does the exact same exercises does. I would recommend spending the extra money to get a watch from a more reputable brand"
204,Jacklyn ,2,the United States ,23-Oct-22,Does not track steps,"I didn’t read the description well enough before purchasing, it does not track your steps. Don’t buy it as an activity tracker. I did like the color and fit though."
205,Dave Dabney,2,the United States ,8-Sep-22,It loses you step count it does not save.,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The watch was for my wife to keep a count of her steps.  it doesn't.  She installed the app on her phone. says she have to always start the step counter. it doesn't serve the purpose it was brought for."
206,Deanna D.,2,the United States ,26-Sep-22,Watch nice- BAND HORRIBLE,The band is awful. Barely a month old and looks like it is years old. Looks awful.
207,diego perez,2,the United States ,11-Sep-22,No me gustó para nada,No me agradó el producto por la batería que lleva que siquiera se carga en 10 minutos se acaba la batería
208,Kim,2,the United States ,2-Sep-22,🙄,I'm not satisfied with this product. It won't connect.  I read and done everything the manual says and nothing😫
209,Barbara Pagán,2,the United States ,19-Aug-22,Is okay I guess,For the price
210,Nell,2,the United States ,4-Mar-22,Open,"This is exactly how my watch came, my finaces was brand new while mine was used and I wasn’t aware they were gonna send a used one. I paid for a brand new one I expect money back for sending a used one when that’s not what I paid for."
211,Deborah Ward,3,the United States ,25-Nov-22,credit card,"The watch is nice but so hard to me to download.  If you want to go further, they require your credit card but say they won't charge you!  It says for location purposes but why not just get my zip code???  I have worn for 3 days and am not happy.  It is difficult to read, offers the smart phone option but my mistake I just wanted a fitbit type item"
212,MEL G,3,the United States ,21-Oct-22,Not what I thought it was...,"I guess I misread the reviews and description.  I thought it would track daily steps as well as all of the other sports but it doesn't really.  It has to be ""activated"" to track walking but if you sit for any length of time, it stops and doesn't start back.  Pretty annoying.  Will have to get something else.  I will keep it for other sports activities though."
213,Elaine,3,the United States ,13-Oct-22,Women’s smart watch,"I liked that the watch accurately tracked my steps for several days at a time  between charges. I liked being able to track my steps and heart beat on the mobile app. However, within two months the band of the pink watch turned brown.  With the months, the band broke."
214,Peggy Hennek,3,the United States ,5-Oct-22,Doesn't work as I anticipated.,I bought it specifically to count my steps so I don't have to carry my phone everywhere. However it doesn't count steps unless I swing my arm. Disappointing. It keeps time. I use the alarms. Good battery life.
215,The Hornbys,3,the United States ,21-Sep-22,It didn't link to my iphone,"Pretty, but would not link to my calendar, messenger, alarms, text. I has a bright light at night. I returned next day because I need to more than a pedometer/watch. I would have kept it if t would have link"
216,Pam,3,the United States ,23-Aug-22,wanted more face options,I was happy with most of the watches functions but very limited face options so I returned it for one that has several face options
217,Rochelle Hopkins,3,the United States ,21-Sep-21,Quit working after a year,"The watch just didn't turn on one day so I thought it was the battery... Nope. It just quit on me literally one year later.*This is the review I had written before it quit working and titled the review ""best bang for you buck* with five stars: It's basically the price of a normal watch and it does everything a smart watch does except answer calls or respond to texts. I didn't want a huge watch and it's a great size for me. The battery life is amazing! The only thing is that it disconnects from the Bluetooth when you get out of range, the phone turns off, or the watch turns off, and only reconnects automatically. I would HIGHLY recommend getting black. I got pink, and the band got discolored in a couple days. I couldn't seem to find a great way to clean the band either."
218,Katie,3,the United States ,14-Jul-21,Nice but didn’t have all the options I’m looking for.,I love the convenience of the watch and it has a nice large screen. The alerts are loud enough or they vibrate hard enough. My problem with the watch is that all of a sudden I’m getting 2 times as many steps in a day as I was carrying my phone on me all day and they do not allow for any kind of modification of your weight or height. There’s no possible way they can know how many steps I’m taking if they don’t even know how big my steps are. Also there’s been more than once where my sleep tracking has said that I was asleep for over eight hours but in a six hour period. I also wish there was some sort of GPS tracking on the app itself for when I’m hiking to make my steps accurate. I’m going to have to buy a different watch.
219,Randi,3,the United States ,24-Mar-21,"Watch=good, band=not so good","Overall, the watch is great and I really enjoy it.Downside is that there are no replacement bands for this product. This band is made of TPU and the buckle is metallurgy according to the company website. If you have a contact allergy to nickel, this is NOT the watch for you. About 3 days after getting the watch, I started having a reaction. After 3 more days of not wearing the watch, I still had marks from the reaction. I bought a band for a Samsung watch, shaved down where the watch and band connect, and then used the pins from the original band.I tried to contact the company and they said they have not made any other bands for this watch. I was told that when they do develop other bands, they would let me know. They also went as far as suggesting I return the watch."
220,Michelle L.,3,the United States ,17-May-22,Very disappointed,I have had this watch for 3 months. I have been very happy with it until this morning. The piece on the watch itself broke. This sucks. Hopefully I can superglue it.
221,Arianna Nelson,4,the United States ,16-Sep-22,Basic watch,"This is just a basic watch it's still a smartwatch it's just won't do anything a Apple watch will do. This watch is mainly meant for exercising like checking your heart rate, the amount of calories you burn ,the amount of steps you walk. Blah blah. The mobile app sometimes disconnects from the watch but you can just sync it up pretty easily. The watch will receive messages from Snapchat , insta and normal text messages it also reserves calls. But you cannot respond on the watch. Also if you have like a fancy font it won't show up on the watch ( I don't know if that makes sense ). This wasn't exactly what I was looking for but I'm glad I got it. It's simple and I like it."
222,Amazon Customer,4,the United States ,4-Oct-22,Great for the price!,"With it being on the cheap end for these types of watches I was skeptical but it does basically anything and everything I wanted it for (heart rate, time, steps, etc). Bought two and they both have great battery life so far, charged it once out of the box and haven't had to charge for nearly 3 weeks now."
223,Dee Dee,4,the United States ,8-Sep-22,Not bad for the price,For the price this is good deal. All of the features work but I compared the accuracy of the step counter by wearing an accurate pedometer and found the watch to be off by about forty percent. I don’t care because I needed a smart watch with big numbers. I also checked the sleep calculations against a Fitbit. The sleep amounts were accurate. I like having the heart rate feature. I think this is a good stand in for the price. I will purchase a Garmin some time in the future.
224,Janice Burton,4,the United States ,25-Sep-22,Instructions,Like the watch. Love the size easier for me to see.  Wish there were better instructions  with it
225,Crys,4,the United States ,2-Aug-22,Very easy and straight to the point,"I love this watch! It’s simple and does the basics. I don’t really use all of the capabilities since I really only need the time, alarms, sleep, and pedometer features on both the watch and the app. Battery life is really good. Based on the features I use, the battery lasts about a month which is why I prefer this watch."
226,Sabrina Riddleberger,4,the United States ,26-Aug-22,This is a great watch..my only complaint..,The only thing I don't like is that you can't answer messages.
227,B,4,the United States ,24-Jun-22,"Great battery life, great for the price","I've been using this for a few months now. Battery life is spectacular. I rarely charge it. The notifications are usually good, but you do need to turn on and off the SNS alert option in the app sometimes because notifications will randomly stop coming. I wish there were notifications for more apps, discord especially. Maybe someday the app will add this?"
228,Aaron M. Stigall,4,the United States ,19-May-22,"great buy for the price, but touch screen and button sensitivity is not that great","I overall enjoy the product at the price, but the button and the touchscreen is not that on point in sensitivity when screen is prompted or when button is pressed. Overall I'm satisfied though, the app is ok. Just remember to open the app after restarting or turning on phone, or the app will not send push notifications until you pull down the screen in the app to resync the watch to the app."
229,Amazon Customer,4,the United States ,24-Jul-22,Works good,Bought  for grandson
230,merilee perrine,4,the United States ,21-Jun-22,Watch,Great watch but doesn't count steps well.
231,Mr Em,5,the United States ,13-Oct-22,It’s pretty good,"I don’t need or want a full blown smart watch, I really only wanted a fitness tracker with a functional app since the last one I owned was a Jawbone UP band and those just don’t exist anymore. This works! There’s only two things that have bugged me.First: On the app, it keeps telling me to verify my account. But the email never comes. I looked, I typed the email right and there’s nothing in my spam folder.Second: Other reviews have mentioned it but the sleep tracking doesn’t resume if you get up for anything in the middle of the night (bathroom trip, shooing the kitten off of crinkly papers that sound like fireworks in the dark, closing the window you left cracked before the night temp drop, etc). So as far as this thing’s concerned I’m a 5am level early riser and that’s that. The option of manually stop/starting sleep time would be great.Edit: Both issues resolved themselves! Sleep is tracking fine even if I get up. I’m pretty happy overall, just have to remember to charge it once in a while. :)"
232,Pauline Wood,5,the United States ,16-Nov-22,How to read the watch,Too early to tell. Only had it one day. So far I really like it
233,Cesar Altamirano,5,the United States ,10-Nov-22,Excelente tiempo de entrega y artículo muy lindo .,Me gustó el tiempo de entrega y el artículo es lo que esperaba .
234,angielyons,5,the United States ,19-Oct-22,Wonderful watch,I got this as a gift for my husband. He loves it. Especially since it's water proof or resistant.  We've gone on vacation and he has gotten in the pool and hot tub with it on and still works great.
235,patrick stephenson,5,the United States ,12-Nov-22,Great purchase!,Reasonable price! Works great.
236,lesly,5,the United States ,11-Oct-22,good cheap alternative,ive had this watch for some months now and its so helpful. the step traccker is accurate. so is the calorie one ( at least as accurate as a device can get). anyway the only part idk about is the heart rate monitor. idk if it really tracks it accurately.
237,Rubén Batista,5,the United States ,11-Nov-22,Excelente,"Excelente, uso personal"
238,Lisa E.,5,the United States ,22-Sep-22,I wish I'd bought the black  band!,"I love this watch's simplicity/being so user friendly. I've had several Fitbit's- EVERYSINGLE ONE OF THEM I lost because the band would constantly become dislodged from the watch. THIS watch did not have that problem, but the light pink color picks up EVERY dark color you wear. My pink watch now has black all over the band- the edges- that I CANNOT remove.  I've tried every industrial cleaner there is!!"
239,Walker,5,the United States ,18-Oct-22,Dependable,I love this item I use it everyday.  I'm down 2 dress sizes.
240,Romona Clavette,5,the United States ,17-Mar-22,"Good features, great price","Although I haven't had the opportunity to use all of the features yet I do like the ones I have used.  I wanted something that would track my steps and notify me when I had a text message or phone call as well as display the time.  The time is displayed in a large font which is easily read.  Text messages are also pretty easy to read on the display.  This was accomplished with a fairly normal sized display.  Some fitness tracking watches have what I consider to be an over sized display, which I find uncomfortable and unattractive."
241,JK Jordan,1,the United States ,14-Jun-22,"Doesn't work with my phone, Withings support didn't help","I paid $300 for this ScanWatch the end of May 2022.  I spent hours trying to get it to work with the app, carefully following all their instructions and the suggestions in the troubleshooting files.I finally sent a message to Withings support.  They responded with a list of steps (no different from what I had tried several times).  I spent several more hours repeatedly trying to get it work, carefully following the steps exactly.  This also didn't work giving the same error message, that the app could not connect to the watch.  Several times it did appear to connect but the app kept telling me the watch was not found, try again.I wonder if the app and watch are somehow incompatible with my phone, a Samsung Galaxy S7.  Perhaps they didn't test it with this phone and just assumed or hoped it would work. Or maybe enough of their watches work with other phones that they don't care about those that will not.  It certainly was a waste of my time.I returned the watch to Amazon for a refund.  After further research I purchased a Amazfit GTS 2 Mini for 1/3 the cost.  The app installed easily and connected to the watch the first time.  I spent far, far, less time, far less money, and have something that seems to work fine after several days of use.  The battery life appears to be exceptional.  I'll post a review under that product after a month or so of use."
242,Izzi,1,the United States ,27-Apr-22,"Beautiful watch, terrible accuracy and calculations","I bought this watch to track fitness activity and overall health progress but I wanted a watch that looked like your standard watch -- not a square smartwatch. I found Withings and thought their ScanWatches were beautiful, and reading that they tracked the basics, I decided to purchase.After using the watch for four days, I noticed that my daily caloric burn was crazy low, compared to what I used to burn from my FitBit (which I know over-reports calorie burning).!! Withings does NOT take your heart rate into account when calculating calories burned during a workout !!I contacted their support to find out more about this and they also said they do not report any calorie burning for non-reported activity; ie if I were to walk around my house doing light chores, that would not be counted as calorie-burning. I found this frustrating because on rest days where I did not work out, the watch told me that I only burned 1300 calories (even if I did get out of the house to run errands, so it should have been higher). Multiple TDEE (total daily energy expenditure) calculators said I should be burning 1650-1750 calories on rest / sedentary days.I found the sleep data and my heart rate data to be accurate, but in terms of actually accounting for calories burned this product is a failure.DO NOT GET THIS WATCH if you need something to estimate how many calories you burn during work outs for CICO or any other calorie deficit weight loss programs.If you need it to see what time it is and how many steps you've taken today, then by all means spend $300 on something you can buy for $50."
243,Geoff Hill,1,the United States ,31-Jan-22,This watch was a huge disappointment.,"I live in New Zealand and was not able to get the Withings ScanWatch in NZ as no one had any stock, and no one would sell a Scanwatch to me in Australia of the UK.  It was very bizarre, I could buy the watch but as soon as it was established that I lived in NZ they declined to sell and this was re-seller after re-seller despite the fact that they do sell other products internationally and I have bought from some of them before.  So when I managed to buy a ScanWatch from Amazon USA I was ecstatic and the watch duly arrived and seemed in perfect condition.  The only problem was that the ECG and SP02 features would not operate.  It transpired that this was the case with any ScanWatch purchased in the USA and these features could only be activated if the customer was resident in the US.  The only problem was that Amazon USA did not tell me this when I purchased the watch.  ECG and SP02 are essential features of the watch so I sent it back but have still not received a refund.  As for Withings, they were a complete waste of space, were extremely evasive, and for a long time didn't even acknowledge that the problem that I had existed and did not / would not facilitate the purchase by myself of a fully operating ScanWatch.  My strong advice would be not to have anything to do with Withings or their ScanWatch."
244,Customer,1,the United States ,16-Aug-22,No sleep data on WATCH :(,"So I like this watch a lot, but I wanted to see sleep data on the watch, at least the latest night data.Instead it requires bluetooth connection and mobile phone app.I dont like turning on bluetooth especially as I sleep or wake up. which is when I want to see the data. I especially dont want to get up and grab and see a bright phone screen which is required since it uses the app.Hope withings can push an update to show at least the latest night sleep data(length, deep sleep and light sleep numbers, avg heart rate)I would be happy to change this to five stars if so.Pros:long battery lifeCons:no sleep data on watchMaybe they can release a more premium version with GPS that can be turned on onboard too, But its fine if not, as I may get the Garmin Instinct 2 Solar instead. I just dont like to use multiple watches though :/"
245,debbie benzur,1,the United States ,15-Sep-22,Quality control issue,"I was very pleased with this watch. It did exactly what I wanted it to do-- record my sleep patterns ( I have Sleep Apnea), indicate signs of atrial fibrillation and to give me an ECG read out. But one cause of concern I noticed was that the watch indicated a blood oxygen level of 84% on the same day that I was tested at the cardiologist, where my level was 98%. Other than that, the watch worked well. Unfortunately, after about four months the watch would not charge, which seems to be a common problem. After a week of emails with Withings, I was able to return the watch  to Amazon but the refund was $ 40.00 less than I paid for the watch. Sad thing is that I really liked the watch, but apparently Withings has a quality control issue that needs to be addressed. I would not buy this product again."
246,GSB,1,the United States ,21-Jul-22,Not compatible with Android devices,"The watch performed for only 4 months.  After the first software upgrade it began to not sync with its Healthmate app on my Android smartwatch nor my Samsung tablet. Went to Withings support and tried all of the resetting, dissociating, uninstalling, re-pairing steps--all the techniques to reset the watch and then synch it with the Healthmate app again and again. This process took at least 15 minutes each time. The frequency increased over the ensuing two months. I went back and forth with Withings support team by email 13 times, and each time they wanted more information. Finally after a month of inquiry and frustration they told me they could not honor their 2 year warranty for the watch because it was purchased from Amazon and not from them directly. By that time the Amazon warranty of 30 days had well passed. So purchasing from Amazon automatically negates the manufacturer's warranty. Don't buy this watch if you are an Android user."
247,Rebecca Kodysh,1,the United States ,23-Nov-22,Terrible Customer Service,"It is a great watch, however the dial on mine is not straight.  When telling them about it, they blew me off and refused to do anything about it.  I sent them pictures and a detailed description of the defect.  What a joke for such an expensive watch.  They absolutely do NOT honor their warranty."
248,Rob Houck,1,the United States ,21-Apr-22,Do Not Risk It - TERRIBLE Support,"Here’s the thing, if you get a watch that happens to work, you may have a good experience, who knows, but keep in mind that if something goes wrong, you are completely out of luck relying on Withings.I have a clearly documented use case of following all Withings documentation with a compatible phone and network but continually receiving an unhandled software error that prevents the watch from syncing data, and Support is unable to fix OR REFUND.What Withings does is send you to a support team that will wear you down and give up. They respond to you once a day (with steps that are already available online) even if this drags the process out for literally weeks. When you get fed up and ask for a refund or a phone call, they will refuse until you keep jumping through an endless amount of future hoops.For my case, where I sent them a screen recording of the device failing, they literally told me that I should try using my neighbor’s WiFi or get another phone.If you buy Withings, good luck if you need Support…"
249,B. Markus,1,the United States ,4-Feb-22,Not accurate device. Does not deliver the specs.,"This great looking black watch is easy to read. It feels good at the arm.Unfortunately it does not deliver the promised measurements and is not accurate enough to take conclusions from the measures.- sleep monitoring is hard to judge because there is no comparison.- heart rate is off by +/- 10 beats per minute. So if you measure 69 it could be 79 or 59 when measured manually.- steps per day is highly inaccurate. Compared to manual measurement this is up to 100% off. If the daily value is 2000, it could be more than 4000 in reality. This is not usable for checking the health or do exercise if the values are so much off.- clock is working fine. The accuracy is good.- battery life with close to 24h waering (body temperature) is three weeks, which is fine with me but the specifications are mentioning 4 weeks.I was inclined to give the useless watch back (well it shows the time accurately), but unfortunately it took me too long to check.Now I have a $250 paperweight..."
250,Rich W,1,the United States ,11-May-22,Advertised ECG tracking feature missing,"Very disappointed that only after buying and wearing the watch, taking an ECG which then gets reviewed by the company Cardiologist, you are given permission to take further spot ECG’s.You then search high and low for hours to figure out how to turn on the promoted constant ECG tracking feature.This is the only reason that I, and most certainly other individuals with Afib and tachycardia bought the watch. BIG surprise now ; the watch can’t do this, there is no setting visible because it does not have FDA approval for it “at this time”.What a waste of time and effort! And such misleading promotion in their literature. I returned the watch."
251,Craig S,2,the United States ,14-Nov-22,Limited in the USA,"Misleading claims.1. The band is too small for an adult male. Couldn't find a larger band.2. O2 saturation can't be measured reliably, and doing it as part of sleep tracking kills the battery life.3. Can't get heart (EKG) results unless you agree to give your data to a third party. Even after that, you can't get full use of the feature.Basically it's an EU product with limited value for US buyers."
252,Lutfi Abolsaoud,2,the United States ,17-Oct-22,Below expectations,"Not suitable for businessman, such premium design/watch should atleast have some premium features, but unfortunately it's not different than the 150$. Proof that the make year shows 2020. So all what you will get is an old watch with a new coverSome of my disappointmentI cannot answer or decline callsNot possible to view your calendar to check previous or next reminders or appointments, for instance, it alerts you on the spot, if you missed looking at the watch, then you cannot retrieve it unless you back to your phone and check what is your next schedule."
253,Donald Henig,2,the United States ,25-Apr-22,"Frustratingly poor support, which shouldn't be needed if done properly","Couldn't wait for this watch.  Watched a bunch of videos.  Took my time going through every step of the set-up, but the ECG and SPO2 keep referring me back to the app and the app just takes you through set-up again and again...  Posted questions.. nada.  Sent email to support and their support email is wrong - it bounced.  So far, seems like a good idea but not fully baked yet.  Shame!  I hope I update this to be positive at some point.Update: I want so bad to adjust the overall rating, but it is not a fully-baked product.  The ecg would not work, but after trying for maybe 5 days, it worked.  They have to approve the results, which they did eventually, so good to go.  The system still says ""must be approved"" (they don't sync between the watch, the app and the site, which sends emails and results.  The Workout button gives plenty of choices if you can see them - too small.  You can't just click ' workout', it won't start tracking.  It's just not intuitive at all.  Really wanted it to work, but just not there yet.  maybe the next model."
254,Cris,2,the United States ,22-Sep-22,Not working the EKG app,"Very good looking watch  but I did purchase for the EKG apps. I  need to see the rhythms when I feel palpitations but the watch send to a 3rd party company and takes 2 or more days to get back to my app. Not useful, so I did have to return it. Also frustrated with oxygen saturation reading: lower than my pulse oxymetry, and constant messages as ""can read, inconsistent"". My 50 dollars watch is very accurate for oxygen reading but have no EKG options.Beautiful watch otherwise!"
255,Anemone of the State,2,the United States ,14-Jun-22,Keeps time rather poorly,"Fundamentally, if nothing else, a watch needs to keep accurate time.  My wife didn't sync the watch for a week due to an unrelated phone issue, and it lost several hours.  Last night she synced the watch with the phone app early in the eventing.  Less than 12 hours later, it had lost about 12 minutes.  In both cases, the battery is > 80%.On the basis of this behavior alone, I would return the watch, but we are beyond Amazon's return window.Automatic activity detection is somewhat less than hoped for, rather similar to Garmin's implementation.One minor quibble is that the watch displays only a subset of the phone notifications that Garmin's watch will display.  For example, it will display Apple's Messages, but will not alert the user to the content or even the presence of a text received on Signal."
256,Sara Lancaster,2,the United States ,25-Aug-22,Wasn’t a fan.,"I liked how pretty it was. I liked how it looked like a real watch. However it wasn’t accurate on the pulse ox, I didn’t like how it showed notifications like a banner and they were super short. I guess going from a FitBit to this one, I was a little spoiled but eventually what drove me to send it back was that it kept getting loose no matter what setting I put the wrist on. That was driving me crazy! I ended up getting a Garmin Hybrid and I am very happy I did."

258,Amazon Customer,2,the United States ,23-Aug-22,Beatiful but cant keep the time.,"Very satisfied with the look, feel and functionality, but having to re-adjust the time or open the app to syn the correct time each few days, you don't expect this kind of issues from a $510 watch."
259,Mario D. Pachano,2,the United States ,16-May-22,Too many issues for the price,It automatically records some nonwalking activities as walking and there is nothing you can do to edit them out.  Happens to me every day - very annoying.  It keeps adding 'Bicycle riding as an activity and I keep having to remove them - somehow picking up my activity incorrectly.  Sometimes it does not track all my sleep - If I wake up for in the middle of the night and have a snack it will not count the hours of sleep before that.
260,Nelson C. Jones,2,the United States ,4-Apr-22,Doesn't do well in Heat,"I like to monitor my heart rate when I am taking Hot Yoga and or in the Sauna. I've been doing this for years with my Fitbits.  However, after one sauna session with the Withing, the inside of the glass fogged up and the battery then quickly discharged.  Now the dial no longer works.  I am hoping this was just a defective unit.  The build quality on these watches is amazing and the batter life is phenomenal. I've sent in the unit for exchange.  I'll write another review to let you know if the replacement holds up."
261,AngMKay,3,the United States ,20-Sep-22,"Reasonably decent, but not the best","I had another hybrid style smartwatch before I got this. After a few years, it started having some glitches and I decided to upgrade. I don’t need or want a full fledged smartwatch. I just like to be able to track my steps, maybe see some other stats and also tell me the time. On all fronts, this worked pretty well, and is absolutely gorgeous to boot. The step counter is way way off from my previous watch(es) I’ve used so I’m not sure which is more accurate. I normally hit 9-10k a day, but this put me more at 4-5k. I don’t really care about the number per se, as long as I can track the trends. Taking spo2 and ecg measurements was way more finicky than I thought it would be-you have to sit really still or it gives you an error, you have to press the watch down so the reading is accurate. I almost always got an error or inconclusive reading, so I just wouldn’t use those features often. The app is pretty easy to use, the watch syncs with it way faster than my old watch did.My main issues are with the watch case itself. It’s a really nice looking watch, but considerably thicker than my other ones. I thought having a side button would be nice, because it has that more analog look I like, but it would get pressed all the time. I turned off the “long press” feature so I’d stop taking random ECGs all day, but it was still in the way for someone wearing a watch on their left hand. And it was hard to read the face of the watch because it was so reflective with the domed glass on the front. I didn’t really get to try out the long battery life before I returned it, but charging took way way longer than I’m used to.I ended up returning it after a couple of days. Had it been my first hybrid I might have liked it more but I’m used to my old watch and comparatively speaking, this one just isn’t as good for me. I’ll stick with the brand I know works for me and just get their newer ones, even if I like the look of this one better."
262,Patricia Maden,3,the United States ,29-Nov-22,Withings ScanWatch Horizon does not meet with expectations - especially at this price point,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I liked the built quality of the Horizon watch, and the supply vinyl blue strap is very comfortable; I have yet to try the metal strap. Battery life is excellent. The App is average but informative enough. The Horizon watch has illuminated numbers, and they are great; however, the hour and minute dials are not illuminated. Therefore, you can easily see the hour marks but cannot read the time in the dark. There is no second dial! Withings made a very high advertisement about the accuracy of this watch; unfortunately, I cannot verify that. I experienced the essential reading was off. Step counting is way off; I am talking about several thousand steps wrong! I use CPAP and O2 sensors at night to monitor my sleep; the Horizon watch gets close readings but is easily off by 5%. My old Galaxy Classic 4 reads more comparable to professional equipment. Overall, it is a nice-looking watch with long battery life. Suppose you do not need accuracy and are okay with the lack of seconds dial and night readings, then you should consider. It does not come close as advertised, at least at this price point; it is a disappointment and certainly returning. I hope this review helps others."
263,Jamie Stone,3,the United States ,10-Sep-22,Great actual watch but beware you damage it in any way.,"First of all, I love how the watch looks and feels, and the battery life is fantastic. The mobile app is easy to use and isn't as busy as the Fitbit user interface. I can't give it more than three stars, however.Here's what happened, I had the watch for a couple of months. I'm not sure how it even happened, but I noticed that the crown had dislodged one day and was off track. Note, I don't play sports; I only go for runs or to the gym. The crown is how you cycle through the different screens on the smartwatch (Clock, heart rate, calories, workouts, and so on).The crown could turn but would stick. So since the watch was not that old, I contacted Withings expecting them to send me a return/repair/exchange label or something as the warranty (which doesn't seem to cover anything) was good for two years.I had to answer a few questions and send a pic of the damage. They replied that the crown⸺the only moving part on the watch⸺was not covered by warranty and offered me a 25% discount that I could use on a new watch. I expressed my disappointment, and they sent me a 50% discount coupon, but that was all they could do.So for $300, just know that if you damage your watch in any way and need repair, you are on your own. You can get up to a 50% discount on a new watch (they will first offer only 25%). Maybe I should have stuck with Apple."
264,Jen,3,the United States ,16-Aug-22,A little disappointed,"The watch itself looks nice and is comfortable to wear. I was attracted to this watch because of the ecg feature and sleep monitoring, but both have been a little disappointing. I didn't realize that this only looks for Afib and bundle branch blocks. I have frequent PVCs and occasional ventricular tachycardia runs, and if I didn't know the basics of reading an ecg and if I wasn't already aware of my arrythmias, I might've been fooled by the normal sinus rhythm results I usually get, even when multiple PVCs or vtach is present. Another thing is, it doesn't do well reading anything over 100 bpm, so getting an actual reading when you're having an episode is more of a miss than hit, even when being still. Also, the quality of the ecgs is low. No matter how still I am or how far away from other electronics I get, there is tons of noise in the PDFs. Makes it difficult to properly analyze any intervals or the individual waves. I have an emay ecg device that works much better, but I wanted a watch for the convenience and ease of use.The sleep tracker, for me, is inaccurate, but I believe it's probably due to me having a low resting HR while awake, so it says I was asleep longer than I actually was.Is it worth it? I'd imagine for someone with Afib or suspected Afib it might be. It might also be great for anyone with or suspected sleep apnea. But it's a huge disappointment for me, and I wouldn't spend my money on one again."
265,J.D.,3,the United States ,9-Jul-22,Not worth the money... skip this!,"First of all, I was looking to replace my Fitbit Versa 3 with this primarily because of the water resistance and the thirty day battery life plus reserve.It really is a good looking watch. Why did it take me twenty four hours to decide to return it? First it doesn't record all of the steps. Secondly, it logged me sitting on the couch watching a movie as being asleep. At night, after charging the Super Luminova with light, it faded after two hours. I couldn't see the time without pressing the crown for the display window. With the Versa, simply tilting the wrist made the display visible.It is nice that you can get an SpO2 reading or ECG in 30 seconds. It can detect A Fib, but so can the Versa.For the price, the stainless steel band left a lot to be desired. Instead of a dual deployment class where you can adjust the pins to fine tune your fit, they give you three extra links with the tools needed to swap them in or out. This leaves the watch too snug or too loose.Since it was the battery life and water resistance that drew me in, I probably would have been more satisfied with an Amazfit GTR 3 Pro Limited Edition. It only has a 12 day battery life, but is water resistant to 5 ATM but doesn't detect A Fib. But, it is half the price. So, it's back to the Versa and I'll consider the Amazfit. Sorry the Scanwatch Horizon was disappointing."
266,AM,3,the United States ,5-Nov-22,Inaccurate.,"I sleep like the dead  for 10 hours and according to withings, I haven't slept all night. I still use Sleep Cycle on my phone and expected the watch to be far better. Sleep is pretty simple. Not sure I care to spend $300 on a watch that has not been accuate once in 30 nights.Update: in the past week, there have been some significant software updates. The watch seems to know  now when I am sleeping and it has picked up other things that I hadn't seen before. So, I'm hoping that it keeps getting better."
267,Marshall Webber,3,the United States ,16-May-22,"A watch with a sensor suite, not a 'smartwatch'","I dislike looking like an extra on Buck Rogers with a dinner-plate size watch hanging off my wrist. So smartwatches that look like sci-fi props don't interest me. I got turned on to the Withings ScanWatch by its (relatively) small size, only 38mm diameter, compared to the common 44-48mm 'dinner plate' watches currently popular. The other thing that appealed was the sensor were supposed to be certified by the FDA: BPM, PulseOX, and ECG. Other smartwatches will do it, but are not 'certified' to be used as what is effectively a medical device.I like the fact that I control my data, can send it off to my Doctor at will, and I'm not upcharged for any features. I love the subtlety of the watch, where most people are not even aware it has a sensor package or notifications, or timers, or stopwatches, etc.What I dislike is that notifications are the only Phone to Watch communication. If receiving a text, just the ability to rotate the crown to send back one of three responses (e.g. Yes, No, Eggs [or whatever]) would be a huge improvement. Also, I think there are many more onboard functions that the computer is capable of, but only the basics have been explored.I think Withings has a great start. But the sensor functions are not always accurate, easy to use, or well explained HOW they gather their data (such as sleep tracking) so you will often get bizarre readings from it that would not be tolerated in a true ""medical device."" So 10/10 for style, but 5/10 for creative thinking  for everything the watch COULD do."
268,Elizabeth L Sloan,3,the United States ,2-Jun-22,The BPM and oxygen level functions are “iffy“ compared with my finger oximeter.,"This watch is gorgeous and feels good on the wrist. The white dial is easy to read in different light conditions. The design of the stem as a way to switch functions is clever.However it is a finicky watch. The BPM measurement seems slow to me, taking maybe 30 seconds to yield a number. Most of the time when I try to get an oxygen saturation reading, it takes 3 or 4 tries to get a reading and sometimes after 3 or 4 tries it does not give a reading at all saying “results inconclusive.” It’s frustrating to spend 10 minutes trying to get a reading that the device on my finger gives me in seconds. The device was much cheaper too.The fact that this watch does so much is impressive. There are many features I doubt I’ll ever use. The ECG feature is neat because the watch “calls” a doctor if the ECG indicates atrial fibrillation. That could be a life saver. Luckily I don’t need that feature. I might try the meditation and the exercise tracking though.I will keep trying with this watch for another week or so before giving up. Maybe there’s a way to get it to do measurements faster."
269,Robert L Myers,3,the United States ,4-Nov-22,"Looks cool, but Inaccurate","I worked an all nighter,  but it reported i had deep sleep.  The literature indicates that the watch will report Afib when it occurs.  It does not.  You need to manually run the EKG.  Onthe positive side,it looks cool"
270,Amazon Customer,3,the United States ,7-May-22,"Hour hand stopped working, and the EKG setup reminders never stop","The hour hand started getting stuck when the watch was less than 2 weeks old, but I could calibrate it.  It was annoying, but livable.  Today the watch is a little over a month old, and the hour hand can't even be moved clockwise during calibration - rather problematic for a watch.I really like the watch and most of the app (see below) otherwise, so I've requested an exact replacement from Amazon, and we'll see how the new one works.  I am VERY glad that I bought this through Amazon, so I didn't have to wonder about the manufacturer's return policies!The only other thing I do not like is that the app REALLY wants you to go through the process of getting authorized for an EKG so that you can ""complete the setup"" of your watch.  I don't need an EKG, and I believe it might be insurance fraud if I go through the app's process to find a doctor and (presumably) magically receive approval to get one.  The thing is, the app WILL NOT STOP prompting me to complete this step.  Withing if you read this, PLEASE make that step skippable!"
271,Martin Batten,4,the United States ,24-Jul-22,6 Months ownership,"This is my third intelligent watch.  I started with a 2nd Gen iWatch and used that for a few years.  Last year I decided it needed updating, and driven by cost I purchased a new watch from another manufacturer.  I liked that it operated between charges for 12 days, was lightweight, had a very clear display and could monitor my sleep habits as well.  Then I discovered the hybrid watch, and after careful research bought this one.LIKES:1) I was after a constant-on display, at least to show time.  My previous watches only displayed in response to certain arm movements, and often ignored my attempts to display time, without having to push a button, which required both arms.  My last watch could be set for a constant-on display, but only at the cost of battery consumption and more frequent charging.  This watch simply solves that problem. I am writing this after wearing and using the watch for about a month.  It is only on it’s second charge cycle.2) 24 days between charging, that is an excellent power management scheme built-in.3) ECG and SP02 measurements in addition to heart rate, distance and steps.4) Simple and easy-to-read display of your status, a single knob/button to access any feature the watch has.  And the hands move out of the way if they are obscuring the screen, they are separately motored.5) I’m after functionality, not flash, and this fits the bill perfectly.6) Phone app seems pretty reliable and updates data the watch has collected.7) Simply nice looking and comfortable on the wrist.8) Easy to read single-hand lower dial shows your percentage of steps taken.  Now this could be a second display, or repurposed possibly.DISLIKES:9) The watch collects sleep data, but it only is displayed on the phone app.  The watch itself should include the previous nights sleep score.10) No indication on the watch of the charge remaining in the battery.  Most lithium batteries prefer to be recharged when the remaining charge drops to ~20%.  This watch does inform you when the remaining charge drops below 10%, but that is going further than I would choose. The single-hand lower dial could be usefully re-purposed to display remaining charge which is an option I would use.11) The display, albeit small, does not have a feature where you can have it black-out at night.  My previous watch had an option to set a go-dark period (say 10pm to 6am).  I have noticed this display illuminate while I am moving around in bed.  It is distracting if I am dozing.12) The Bluetooth does not seem to have the range my previous watches had.  If I’m close to my phone any texts coming in will scroll across the screen of the watch.  Many times, I just see a Text icon (…) but no text.  And often it will not even notify me of a text, possibly because it is out of range. I do not lug my phone around with me in the house, which was not a problem before I got this watch.13) The watch is heavier than my previous, probably similar in weight to my old iWatch.14) The watch repeatedly tells me how far I cycled.  I don’t cycle.  I don't have a bike. You cannot turn off that ‘feature’, even though you can deselect cycling as part of your exercise regime.15) To use the ECG and SP02 features you have to put your other hand over the watch top bezel, and hold it there for 30 seconds.  The SP02 readings have been concerning.  It has offered by 02 levels being at 89% or 93%, but when immediately re-taking them, it reports 98% or 99%, so I’m not sure I can trust it.16) The sleep monitor function has accused me of getting up at 4am (not going to happen!) and consequently given me a very low sleep score.17) On the App, it depicts your sleep state from going to bed to getting up in a bar graph form.  The included key to the bar graph is wrong.  It has reversed the bar colors for light sleep and deep sleep.18) I can find no stand for the watch charger.19) There seems to be no indication of when the watch is fully recharged, although it seems to take less than three hours.Overall, this watch is pretty well thought out.  Sure, I have some criticisms, but it is better than the iWatch I was using and I can always see the time single-handed.UPDATE 6 months later. I still like this watch. It had endured some harsh use and looks like new. A couple of negatives:1) The blood oxygen measurement is not reliable. I will try it, which takes 30 seconds of measurement. It comes back as ’measurement failed’. I immediately try it again. 93%. I immediately try it again. 98%. Blood oxygen levels don’t change that fast. Only the ability to read them can.2) The pedometer counts steps, except it consistently undercounts by about 30%. I first noticed this when family and I walked the Las Vegas strip. My family had iwatches fitbits etc. Even though we had walked as a group my step count was 30-40% less than theirs. Theirs were consistent between different products. Mine was always low. I used a belt mounted pedometer and a second Watch product on my other arm for a day. I swapped which watch was on which arm for a second day. The Withings watch always counted ~30% lower. Not a big deal, but could be better.3). The watch lasts days between charges, which is great. But it does not have any indication of the state of the battery until it is below 10%. You can drill down menus on the phone app to find it, but that is not convenient. On its own, that’s ok, except it has a second feature that trips on this. If I glance at my watch, I can see the time based on the hands of course. If I lift my wrist to see the time the digital display lights up as well, depicting the time and date. If I lift my wrist and press the crown I can select readings on the digital display, and cleverly, if either of the two hands are obscuring the display they motor over to 10 and 2 so they are no longer obstructing it. Nice feature. Except if you lift your wrist to see the time when the battery needs recharging, the hands motor to 10 and 2 so the display is unobstructed to inform you it needs recharging. So I glance at my watch, and can no longer deduce the time with the hands. Ok, you say, no big deal. But it has annoyed me more times than I would have anticipated.3) if I get a text on my phone, one of three things happen. Nothing. A message (…) symbol appears on the display. And often, the actual message scrolls across the display. Which is great, except not so much. If you are using your hands when a message arrives, and can’t immediately read the message as it is scrolling through, there is no feature I have found that recalls it on the watch. So you miss the first part of the message , you have to go find your phone to see who sent you something, and what it was. I find this quite distracting.It is still my favorite watch, but there is room for improvement. Lastly, I wish it would display my sleep score. Why I have to open the app on my phone to see that is beyond my understanding."
272,ozone,4,the United States ,11-Sep-22,"Beautiful improvement, but don't expect too much.","I really love this watch.  I say ""watch"" because most of the features of the fitness tracker aren't that accurate.  Let me 'splain.TLDR; It's beautiful, the O2 sensor and heart rate monitor seem pretty accurate, but the steps are off.  Readability is much improved over the previous model, but still not that easy.  The ECG function is pretty cool, but not something you use very often if you are healthy and of course, I have only their word that it really works. It doesn't really detect activity and since I usually forget to start it on a work out, all I get are increased steps.  The crystal is very durable and scratch resistant.  IP68 Waterproof!Long Story:My wife and I are ""required"" to wear a fitness tracker for insurance purposes, because it's a free country and all.  Anyway, they did provide us with something they called a fitness tracker and I called future ocean pollution.  All it did was track steps.  Every other feature was merely derived from that.  I put that on my wrist and walked 10 paces.  It registered 11.  I also put on my friend's uber-expensive Apple watch tracker thing and it registered 0 steps.  I used an app on my phone which registered a massive 40 steps.  I also put on a regular old pedometer and it registered 10 paces.  So from this, I concluded that the pedometer was the best at tracking steps. I should note that 10 steps is not a very big sample and over time switching off various trackers and wearing them simultaneously I found that none of them are really that accurate, so you really need to adjust your thinking on this matter.  Face it, they are measuring arm swings and vibrations to determine how many steps you've taken.  Holding a Starbucks in your hand has GOT to affect that somehow.Because I hated that stupid crappy freebie I was given, I bought the previous model of this Withings which I thought had a beautiful design.  But it had some flaws.  The tick marks for the numbers were so faint and the hands were so difficult to see, determining the time was nearly impossible.  Pressing the button displays the time, but that was pretty much impossible to read outside.  There were few features and the steps were about 30% high (going by the feeling I have after so many tests with steps over the years).This new one has fixed many of those problems.  It is a little larger, which is kind of a bummer for me, since I apparently tend to round corners too sharp and smack it on everything.  That said, it is still much lower profile than most men's watches and I think the larger diameter makes it easier to read.  On that note, they improved the visibility of the tick marks massively as well as the hands and so now you can actually read the time.  Pressing the button displays the time in the tiny attractive circular window at the top, but it is still very difficult to read outdoors.  The heart rate monitor and the O2 levels were very close to the medical finger tip reader we have at home.  So kudos there.  The steps however, report quite a bit low.  For instance, I play disc golf twice a week and sometimes I'm out there for 4 hours.  On a long day like that I know I should be in the neighborhood of 12,000 to 15,000 steps and the Withings will only report my goal of 7000 steps after I've arrived home sometime later in the day.  No flippin way!  For me this is not a problem, because I use these tools on a relative basis.  Disc Golf is 6000.  Today I got 3000 so I'm about 2 hours of golf.  Not a bad day.  But for the insurance company though, you probably want to get that app that over reports by a factor of 4, because the more the better, right?The app is ok.  It has some of the same annoyances that others do.  Nothing is going to be perfect.  Anyway, I could go on all day and still not cover everything, so bottom line;  If you are willing to admit that NO fitness tracker is going to be too accurate, then I think this is the best because even if it weren't a fitness tracker at all, it's still a beautiful watch.  More like a watch +.  Think of it that way and it's totally worth it.  I love mine but can't in good conscience give it the full 5 stars."
273,Joisey,4,the United States ,24-Nov-22,Massive,"I want to begin with that the watch is superbly manufactured, It doesn’t feel cheaply made. I was also impressed that you include the tools required to remove and add bracelet links, and that you provided an additional flexible band. The watch performs as expected, and I am quite pleased with how easy it is to change its settings. I must add that I really wanted to like this watch. There is however another side to my thoughts.The watch is huge. It is much larger and heavier than my other watches. The Horizon’s weight becomes more apparent when the stainless-steel bracelet is used. While the watch face is very readable the round led display feels like a rather large black hole in the upper center of the watch. This makes the watch somewhat unattractive. By the way, when the display is displaying information, the watch becomes more appealing. I’ll now address my thoughts regarding the charging connector.I found that the magnetic connection is not as strong as my Apple watch. As a matter of fact, the Horizon’s connector is more difficult to connect because there are several pins that need to be aligned. With a weaker magnetic connection, it becomes difficult to maintain that connection with the pins. This becomes more apparent when the watch is attached to the stainless-steel bracelet. Unless the bracelet is disconnected from the watch, it is difficult to connect the watch to the charger.Unfortunately, although I really wanted to like this watch, I felt compelled to return it. I hope that you have a different experience and choose to buy and keep this well-made watch."
274,Brian in Seattle,4,the United States ,19-Oct-22,No automated AFib notification in the United States,"I like this watch, but it's my first and only smart watch. I have had some problems with the app, but online support has generally been responsive and helpful. It basically works as promised. Some research of the literature supports that the ScanWatch ECG is about as good as the other watch-based devices and will signal any AFib AFTER you take an ECG. I'm disappointed that the watch DOES NOT have automated AFib detection notifications or heart rate notifications in the US. These features are not yet approved by the FDA. You have to read the fine print to figure this out. If you need these features, then you need an Apple Watch. But that requires an iPhone and I'm not going there. I agree with others that the Steps seem to be off, but I almost always carry my phone (for music or podcasts) and the GPS provides a reliable measure of distance covered. I'm not worried about a specific number of steps, so I think the watch is plenty good to show my effort/performance over time. I like the looks and battery life is reasonable (weeks, not 30d). The sleep tracking is not perfect, but it has helped me understand and track my sleep quality (my opinion). When the watch says I had 50% deep sleep, I can tell that I'm more rested than the many nights I have with lower numbers. And it records heart rate during the night, but I'm not sure it can pick up short-term palpitations. We'll see. If you feel something, you can always take an ECG since it's on your wrist! I think this DATA will help me figure out how to get a better night's sleep. The watch literature says it's not guaranteed to work over two years, so consider paying for product insurance if you want more than that. I consider it a cost worth paying to track heart health and sleep."
275,Amit,4,the United States ,13-Jan-22,"The watch is great at what it does, mobile app could use some work.","I primarily use it for sleep and other health metric/s tracking. The oxygen saturation is clinically validated but the actual test/validation is just for the part that the watch can let you know when your oxygen saturation gets too low during sleep indicating potential issues like sleep apnea. It does not mean however that the oxygen saturation readings are as accurate as an off the shelf pulse oxymeter. If you are buying it for the accuracy, you are better off with actual medical equipment.Now the app is reasonably laid out, but will take some getting used to initially. The most frustrating part was when the app wouldn't sync because it closes in the background and you won't get any notifications until you reopen the app. After a lot of frustration and almost returning the watch I discovered that the problem was how android manages background apps, and I had to turn off battery optimization for this particular app so that it doesn't close the syncing function in the background. The app should have given some information about this when setting it up so that I could do it. And maybe build a better app where the battery optimization can automatically be turned off when you install it? I wonder if Android doesn't let them do it.ECG function needs the info to be sent to some clinic to be validate for the first time and it takes about 24 hours for this, and after that your watch just tells the result from the second time.Battery is amazing but don't be fooled by the 100% indicator. It stay on 100% for 4 days and then drop about 5% per day under normal use for me. I think the battery capacity was not well calibrated in the software, or maybe small batteries are inherently hard to calibrate in the software?The best part about this watch is how it just looks like a watch, no unnecessary styling and/or drama in it. No one bats an eye if you wear this to a formal event and doesn't shine the bright screen in your face when you're going to bed. I found it to be slimmer than other ""smart"" watches too, which makes a lot of difference for me.Choose this over other smart watches if you don't want a distraction on your arm. There are plenty of advantages of ""smart"" watches too, but make sure they are actually solving an issue you have. Like I have my phone with me all the time and I have a Google nest in every room, I don't need to replicate the same stuff that they can do on my wrist. Which is why I chose something that helps me keep track of my health in but is more like a watch than anything.One small thing, I originally thought that the small dial shows battery % but it actually shows the % of step goal you completed for the day. I felt we should have an option to change what it indicates. I don't need that metric on my watch."
276,Keshila,4,the United States ,28-Sep-22,Solid watch,"The watch is beautiful. It looks like a really nice fancy watch. Full disclosure, I returned the watch. I was really looking to wearing it to bed. I’m a light sleeper and found the watch to heavy to wear. My focus is on sleep. I loved the details from the app and that it sends data to Apple Health. This is the only reason I reduced it by one star and why i returned it. For comparison, it’s heavier than Apple Watch 7 and  Fitbit Versa 2. Not by tons but still noticeable for me. Good luck!"
277,W. Bachrach,4,the United States ,27-Dec-21,Absolutely stellar watch but battery life is meh for a hybrid,"Withings wearer for almost two years here. Have had the Scanwatch for a couple months and had the Steel HR before that.First off, if you're reading the reviews you should definitely buy either this watch or the Steel HR. I absolutely love it. It's gorgeous, the app is great, it fits in well to daily life. Looks fantastic whether suited up or wearing grubbies to work on the car. My doctor even hooked up tri-leads to me to compare the ECG with actual medical equipment and they thought it was pretty darn close! Same with O2 sat monitor and heart rate. Quality wise, on par with its excellent forerunner, the Steel HR. The functional twisting crown with haptic feedback is a nicer touch than the push button on the old one.I have to ding it on one star because of the battery life and charge time compared to the prior model. My Steel HR lasted for about a month with all features enabled and charged almost completely in the time it took to take a shower. This one lasts about five days with all features enabled (I know, there are more features). But the bigger problem is charge time. I take the watch off for showers and that's a logical time to charge (obviously you want to wear this in your sleep). About 30 minutes does not come anywhere near to fully charging the battery. Just now it only went from 30-40%. So you need to find time to charge it during the day or occasionally not wear it while sleeping. I think I'm going to disable some of the continuous monitoring features which puts me back at my Steel HR just with sleep disturbance monitoring and O2 sat on demand.Ultimately, if you want activity tracking, heart rate monitoring, enhanced sleep monitoring, ECG and O2 sat WHILE still wearing an attractive watch, this is hard to beat. If you don't care about ECG, O2 and sleep disturbance tracking the Steel HR is the watch to get as it's more or less the same just without those features and is cheaper. As to whether the ScanWatch is with the extra money over the Steel HR, I think that depends on how much you prioritize those extra features and battery life. If this would last a week plus on a charge I'd say the extra hundred bucks is a no brainer. But battery life as it is... tougher call.One other note. While this watch will give you notifications, they're a bit cumbersome on the small screen. I have it turned off."
278,Lizard72,4,the United States ,25-Sep-22,Long battery life,Still working on the accuracy.  I seem to have several thousand more steps using my Fitbit. The biggest issue so far is the magnet on the charger is very weak.  Does not stay attached to the watch if it’s not flat.
279,Tim Williams,4,the United States ,30-Mar-22,A beautiful and slick health watch with one limitation,"This is a beautiful and slick health watch. I've worn it for 5 days and it's very worthwhile. I considered other ""smart"" watches but in the end, since I've had some health problems (history of afib although no issues for the past 7 years), I settled on the Withings Scan watch instead. The watch deserves its good reviews. The watch itself is pretty straightforward to operate, and the Health Mate app is well laid out and functions properly on my Android One Plus phone.  I chose the smaller version of the watch and it fits my 7.25 inch wrist just fine. The strap it came with has plenty of adjustment either way.  A couple of  initial hiccups getting the watch to connect via bluetooth, but since then it connects and syncs with Health Mate very quickly every time. The one limitation: As of this date, Withings has not yet obtained U.S. approval for ""afib"" or ""irregular heart beat"" messages (although the ECG function works OK after I sent in the trial recording, getting approval just a few hours later).  Hopefully this messaging function is pending for the U.S., since it has already been approved in a number of other countries (see the Withings web site). Have to wait and see, I guess. At least there is the functioning ECG. For now, if you can live with just the ECG minus the ""interpretation"" I highly recommend the Scan Watch."
280,slyesa,4,the United States ,21-Jun-22,Sick of an ugly Apple Watch? This could do it,"First let me say that I’m a woman who is 5’4”, 125 lbs and small boned. I was afraid this wouldn’t fit my wrist but it does. This was tough to figure out because every amazon or external review was written by a man. I have to point this out because it BARELY fits and I haven’t tried adjusting the metal band yet. With that said it looks like a normal watch that I wouldn’t be ashamed to wear outside the gym or my Silicon Valley office. Yes, it has less features than my 4th Apple Watch but aside from the find my phone feature I’m not sure I’ll care.So yes women, someday tech companies will figure out we’ll drop $$$. Until then, this may be the best option."
281,Bdiddytampa,5,the United States ,14-Nov-22,My Favorite Smartwatch,"I've tried so many ""Smart"" or digital tracking watches over the years and so far this has been my favorite by far.  Every watch I've tried has ended with the same pitfalls, battery life and longevity.  The Moto 360 was a great watch, but after 2 years I couldn't get it to retain a charge, and replacing the battery on those for even the most average user was an exercise in futility.  The Fitbits worked really well, it had the functionality I needed, and the battery would last most of a week, but a little more than a year after purchasing it (and just out of warranty), the screen started glitching out, it would register phantom inputs, and the battery would die within 24 hours.So far this Withings watch has been top notch on everything.  I can see messages from my phone at a glance, it tracks all of the health goals and statistics I need and more, and the battery lasts FOREVER.  I literally only charge this thing once every 3 weeks, and with the warranty they offer through the manufacturer (5 years), I don't think I'll be worrying about this dying on me in the time frame that I've found problematic in the past.  This IS the most expensive version of this watch, I chose this one because I really liked the look.  It wears, feels, and looks like a quality traditional watch, and I've found it completely worth the price so far.  You can though get the same functionality from one of the cheaper versions.  If you are looking for a great health tracking watch, and you don't need all of the touchscreen app functionality from other ""smart"" watches, this is truly the way to go."
282,OverTheHill,5,the United States ,1-Dec-22,Great Stealth Smart Watch,"After being diagnosed with intermittent AFIB, I wanted a watch that can monitor pulse rate and do a simple quick ECG.  I didn't need all the extra phone and connectivity features in the Apple watch, so I picked the ScanWatch.  Works great for what I need it to do.  Looks like a classy dress watch and doesn't shout ""I AM A SMART WATCH"" to casual observers.  The iPhone app is easy to use and informative.  The stock ""rubber"" strap that comes on the watch was uncomfortable for me, so I ordered a Speidel Twist-O-Flex (Black, 16-22mm, Regular length, Curved ends).  100% improvement in comfort, looks, and easy ON/OFF!"
283,usbritinusa,5,the United States ,1-Sep-22,"Finally, a good hybrid analog smart watch","Background: I own a G-Shock Steel which I love but it lacks smartwatch features so during Prime day I purchased a Amazfit smartwatch that looks very much like an Apple Watch. Unfortunately, I missed the round, analog look and the battery did not meet expectations so I returned it for a Withings Steel HR Sport in black. I liked it but the thin watch hands and their color against the black watch face made reading the time quite difficult, so I returned that. Next came the Timex Metropolitan R AMOLED. This is not a hybrid (my mistake). I liked this watch but it had limited crono faces to choose from and you could not choose / modify the complications. Raising the watch to get the face to appear meant pausing before you could get a quick read of the time which is why I prefer an analog face. Not completely satisfied, I returned and then got a Citizen CZ Hybrid smartwatch. I really liked the look and function of this watch but came to find out that even though it states water resistance to 3 atm, it is only “splash proof” and I confirmed this with Citizenwatch. So essentially it’s a dive watch look-alike that you can’t even wear in the shower. This got sent back.Enter the Withings ScanWatch Horizon: Yes it’s expensive but this is a quality timepiece. With its high quality stainless steel it has weight but not too heavy that I could not sleep while wearing it. The flat sapphire glass is beautiful and very scratch resistant. The bevel rotates anti clockwise but you need to purposefully turn it. It comes with a very nice stainless steel bracelet and a color coordinated silicone band. You can wear this watch swimming, one of the many activities you can track and it’s water resistant to 5 atm (300 feet). The watch face (I got blue) is beautiful and the hour markings and hands glow in the dark.The Withings smart watch functionality is very good although I think sleep tracking can be improved as for example while I was awake in the middle of the night, just lying there was counted as light sleep. Pulse rate, ECG, SP02, Notifications, intelligent wake alarm are all great and bonus, it has a 5 year warranty. So when you take this into account, the price tag is not so bad. I love it and could not be happier. Thanks"
284,TonyT,5,the United States ,10-May-22,Versatile and Stylish,"Okay, I had an ounce of skeptisim about this watch. Now I don't. First off, this is more of a health- monitor/ information watch than. An activity tracker. Withings is going up against some heavy hitters that have established themselves in the activity tracking market. The health monitor segment is not as well know or developed so that's where they have placed their product trying to obtain a market share. That market segment is for young active people who are into the tracking their workout regiment. This watch will do that but it goes beyond that. It tracks your sleep and gives you insite to your overall health using the associated app. I am 61 so I'm not concerned with the little bit of exercise I do. It encourages me to do more but my real concern is my overall health status and catching changes early or being aware of the small changes that happen that can give me an indication something may be going wrong. That's where this watch excells. It tracks data points that help you to self monitor your health. The ECG  and SPO2 monitor give you that information in combination with the sleep tracking that gives an overall picture as to what is going on. They seem to be accurate and you can set them to automatically monitor or you can manually monitor.Which brings me to another thing I like about this watch. I have a smart phone that is able to work as a laptop. That's a lot of information I can assimilate all day long. Smart watches try and cram all of that info onto your wrist, that not what I want. I want to distill my daily interruptions down to what is important. I set my notifications only to the email accounts I have to keep track of ,text messages and calls from two separate phone numbers. They stream across the  screen and I can briefly look at them and decide if I need to pick pick up my phone or go to my tablet to look at the complete message. This feature is not talked about hardly any at all by Withings but it is a strong point of the watch. And it does it with style.And my final point is I am not of the age where flash attracts my attention. Tasteful appointment catches my eye more than anything else.  This is the final strong point of this watch. The subtly of the watch catches everyone off guard. I don't want people to ask or know I have the latest gadget. Rather the surprise that it is more than a watch is a conversation starter.  My wife has seen it and wants one now. I'm going to pick up one for her and get a second rose gold with the blue face for wearing at evening events that are more formal.Final point, as I write this I received my watch and charged it on April 28th. I now have  30% battery left. I have been working through all of the features so I have used it more than I probably will in the future. No complaints about battery life.This watch opens up an entirely new market segment that has not been exploited by any of the other hybrid or smart watch manufacturers. I look forward to seeing the new products they bring out."
285,Brian D.,5,the United States ,25-Aug-22,Just enough smart features,"I have been wearing this watch for a few weeks now and overall I am happy with it. I was replacing a fossil gen 5, which I liked too but I got tired of having to charge it everyday and if I used all the features it would not even make it until bedtime. Since the batteries in smartwatches don't seem to last long enough, I decided to switch to a hybrid watch. If the battery lasts at least a week or two that seems reasonable and this one does.The scan watch gave me what I used most on the gen 5, so I thought I would give it a try. I got the 42mm one because the hands glow in the dark, but I found they are harder to read then just pressing the dial to bring up the digital clock in the small screen, although sometimes it can be too small to read without my glasses.The build quality is good and I think it is attractive. This is the first time I have used a silicone band, but I like it. The band is very long, and I have an average size wrist, so I would say get a different band if you have small wrists.The digital screen is functional but I guess it could be hard for some people to read. Notification alerts are all I was looking for, so the string of text that comes across the screen is enough to let you know what it is or who the notification is from and if I want to look at it.All of the health features are nice and the app is laid out well to read them all. I mostly just track my steps, but I like the other tracking features. The connection to my phone has been fine, except after an update to Android 13, but that seemed to get fixed with an update. The analog tracking dial is also a cool feature.What more can I say, nice watch. Not perfect, but it is a keeper."
286,Carissa,5,the United States ,19-Nov-22,Great watch for people who don’t like to charge often,"My first watch lasted me 4 years (the hour hand quit working after I sanded some floors), so I bought a second. I love the watch because I only have to charge once a month, it’s durable, and can be worn in shower/swimming. I barely take mine off other than to clean it/my wrist. This time around I did buy a screen protector. My old one was pretty scratched up, but again, I wore it for everything."
287,William E Roberts,5,the United States ,20-Nov-22,Very Happy with my purchase! Best fitness watch.,"Best fitness watch I have owned, and I have had several.  In addition, good watch even for non-fitness features.  Battery lasts me 20 to 30 days if the display is sparingly used. Nice look and quality too."
288,Jack Stone,5,the United States ,9-Nov-22,Classy timepiece with hidden modern ingenuity,"Withings knocked it out of the park. Great watch. Battery life does well. Gives me the options I'm interested in and looks great all the time. Stellar job on this fine piece of engineering. A lot of other watch companies could learn a few things in being classy, modern, and durable."
289,BillyM,5,the United States ,1-May-22,Early review but happy so far,"I'm an Apple everything user and wore an Apple Watch series 4 for a few years but recently traded it in. When wearing the Apple Watch, while I (mostly) liked all the integration, I often found myself wishing I had a nicer looking watch (especially for dressier times). I also found that the Apple Watch offered a little too much and could be distracting with all of its features and alerts. Since the series 4 didn't have an always on display, I found night time driving annoying because it would constantly light up and be distracting while moving my arms around. Yes, I know I could disable the ""wake display on arm raise"" feature but, with no other way to see the time (other than pushing the button), this was the setting I liked most of the time; so I left it that way at night too.Anyhow, I thought I'd give this watch a shot since it looked so much nicer and I didn't need any light up displays to simply see what time it was. The fact that this model has an FDA cleared ECG and SPo2 feature is a bargain compared to what it costs for that on the Apple Watch. I've had the watch for only a few days but have been happy with it so far. Very easy  setup, super quick to tell time, I can get a simple vibration alert when a phone call or text comes in (all selectable), track exercise, HR, SPo2, etc. Even if I get 15 of the 30 promised days of battery life then that is better than the average 1 day battery life on an Apple Watch. So far, I'm happy with the trade offs that had to be made to make this a nice looking watch with long battery life.I tried both the 42mm and 38mm watch. I'm a 5'9"" 165 pound male and have a 17cm wrist circumference. While the 42mm looks a little big on me, the 38mm doesn't really look all that smaller to me. Personally, I liked the brushed nickel look, more detailed watch face, and easier to see hands of the 42mm over the (shiny finish and less detailed face of the) 38mm but that's all personal preference. Biggest issue for me is that the band is pretty big on me and has a lot of extra length that shows. I'll probably order a different band at some point."
290,Jaykay,5,the United States ,17-Sep-22,Love this watch!,"Two weeks in and I am very pleased.  I bought this watch to do three specific things (besides keeping time):  1) Monitor for a-fib and provide a cardiac rhythm strip (not really an “EKG”) for my cardiologist.  2) Monitor my sleep and O2 sats within reasonable accuracy parameters. 3) Allow me to screen emails without pulling the phone out.  This Watch checks all the boxes and I am fine with analog face, have never really used a digital watch.  Have only charged once so battery is a bonus- I sent back an Apple Watch because the short battery life.  Included strap is very comfortable and the weight is fine, actually lighter than my prior diving watch.  The watch looks great but that is low on my list.  I do not wear it in the shower and probably will always keep it out of water, after all my diving watch is for that.  Very pleased so far…hoping the reliability won’t let me down!"
291,csmith,1,the United States ,23-Oct-22,Look elsewhere unless you love charging,"I'll start with the pros because sadly there aren't many. It feels premium and I personally like the small footprint on my wrist as it's not heavy and is comfortable with the band it ships with. Everything else leaves me wondering why I've stuck with Google this long. Battery life is the main reason I returned this watch. If you don't ever touch it, leave the screen dark, disable every feature you can and leave battery saver on constantly, you'll get at most 20 hours of use per day because the thing can't make it a full 24 hours, even when you aren't wearing it at all! I have to charge 2-3 times per day (twice if I do no exercise at all) and it takes around 1.5-2 hours to charge, which seems excessive given my phone can charge from 0-100% in 28 minutes. When you aren't charging, you have to deal with no spo2 sensor (even though it has one), AFib tracking doesn't work constantly and the speakerphone is ENTIRELY UNUSABLE. It crackles when turned up loud enough to almost hear it and when it isn't crackling it's not loud enough to make out voice. You can't even hear the Assistant talk and the alarm wouldn't be noticeable if not for the vibrating. This watch makes me want to spend thousands to switch back and be an Apple customer after years of leaning towards Google for everything. This watch was a swing and a huge miss. This watch doesn't even compete with 5 year old watches out there. Not sure what Google was thinking, but it's making me reconsider being a Google Fanboy as no other Android watch checks all the boxes. My other complaint is the FitBit Premium membership needed to keep most of your data long-term unless you export it elsewhere (which isn't too difficult). Ultimately this experience pushed me to decide to not use a watch for now and I'm going to quit using Google Fit on my phone as I feel I should be getting paid for them to keep and sell my data to others. My other negative is the impact that this has to the environment. While the manufacturing process already did enough damage, this watch needs so much electricity to  stay alive that it will cost me more than the watches value to keep it charged, creating more unnecessary environmental impact and costing me more in electricity daily.  I can't even believe that I came to these conclusions because I'm a techie/nerd and usually need all the latest/greatest products.Would not recommend this subpar watch, most likely will convert me from Googles [clearly] subpar Ecosystem. Even Fitbit Sense (which Google owns) gets at least 6x battery life and has more features, but Google made lots of promises for that watch that they still have yet to deliver - so I'm going without a watch now. Very sad this is what they released as their first watch. Maybe they should have waited yet another year if this is all they could do? Everyone I know that got a Pixel watch returned them and everyone I knew that wanted one no longer does. Pretty sad, but you sure aren't getting what you're paying for here. Google needs to remember who their customers are..."
292,thelastviking85,1,the United States ,31-Oct-22,Fragile beyond belief.,The new pixel watch is beautiful to look at.It's also soo fragile the moment i saw that rounded glass display i knew i had to protect that from any bumps so i did and got that protected what i did not expect is the display itself being soo delicate and fragile gorilla glass 5 supposedly we'll it can't handle me wiping off finger smudges with my downy soft cotton t-shirt I've not had the watch in use not even a day i went outside into the sun and my finger smudges where all over it so i wipe them off with my soft cotton t-shirt big mistake it now has forever fine line scratches that catches the sunlight to remind me of my mistake of buying a first gen watch from Google.Be warned anything more than bunny fur will scratch the new pixel watch glass such a big letdown.
293,Kindle Customer,1,the United States ,6-Dec-22,DO NOT PURCHASE!!,"Whole back cover fell off in my sleep after 3 days of normal use, no water, nothing crazy.  Google said this was not covered under warranty.  There is not even a department for tech support for this watch yet.  It took them 15 days to even tell me that it wasn't covered so I just returned it.  Very disappointing.  I do not recommend purchasing this at all."
294,Lisa Murray,1,the United States ,12-Nov-22,So dysfunctional I could not even make it through the setup process,While trying to set this up it kept making me enter a four digit PIN after the screen would lock. Then when trying to run me through the tutorial it would not accept my finger for swiping up and just kept repeating letters randomly. When trying to update the system it would not let me go to the settings for the system. The battery was fully charged when I first tried to start setting this up and had to charge it twice during the process. I am so discouraged with this product. I was really hoping it would work well.
295,T. M.,1,the United States ,12-Nov-22,Disappointed,"I'm really disappointed with the Pixel watch.  I have the Pixel 6 pro phone and love it.  But the watch... the most disconcerting thing is that it will not consistently sync with Fitbit.  It just stops syncing, affecting my participation in my employer's wellness program.  The battery doesn't last longer than one day.  The faces are limited in what data can be displayed.  I've been a Fitbit user for many years and have never had such problems.  I'll probably go back to my Fitbit device."
296,Andrea Miller,1,the United States ,9-Nov-22,Battery life.. What is that? Why is it non-existent?,"So incredibly disappointed in the lack of battery life! It's 2022... How does this thing only last like 12 hours? I even turned off the heads up display thing to say battery life and that did nothing. This is so incredibly disappointing! What are you guys doing in the practice and trial run lab for the rest of us that actually work on a daily basis and were so excited about this, we are super not impressed.. come on Google... Get your s*** together"
297,David,1,the United States ,29-Oct-22,"""Do not Disturb"" does not work!!!!","I got the watch on 10/23 set everything up and disabled texts and calls from going to my phone (Pixel 6), on 10/26, I am now getting all calls going to Pixel watch and there is no way to disable. If it isn't resolved in the next few days, will be returning watch.Battery is horrible, but overall it is a nice watch, definitely worth it. (If the above issue is fixed ASAP)(Will update to 4 stars once the above issue is fixed)"
298,Justin B,1,the United States ,27-Oct-22,Epic failure,"This watch is a complete failure from Google!I had high hopes. The watch is comfortable and responsive, but is completely unusable. The battery lasts about 4-5 hours on a full charge doing nothing on it. I have GPS, tilt to wake and always on screen disabled. Charge to 100% at midnight when I go to bed, by 4-5 am it's dead. Charge to 100% in morning, use it for some notifications and few texts 3 hours later it's dead again. This is complete junk not happy."
299,Scot T.,1,the United States ,17-Oct-22,Too small!,"What in the hell is Google thinking? Have they not seen the trend in watch sizes? This thing is so small it looks like a woman's watch on my wrist, and i have thin-ish wrists. It would look ridiculous on a man with decent size arms.I don't care about how good it is - it just looks so ridiculously small it is actually embarrassing. I immediately returned it for a refund."
300,Shawn,1,the United States ,19-Oct-22,Low End Fitbit,Significantly less features and functions than the Fitbit Sense. No SpO2 tracking. Banks require phone call to activate Google Pay on watch when it's not required to activate Google Pay on your phone. Battery drains at 25% every 2 hours right out of the box after being fully charged. You get about 8 hrs before the battery is dead.
301,J. Seiler,2,the United States ,6-Dec-22,Not ready for primetime!,"Bought Oct 6, 2022 ... died Dec 6, 2022. Have owned several (at least 4 others) fitness/activity trackers, 2 from Fitbit. In this case, the product is extremely attractive, but features leave much to be desired. Charging time is well over an hour but operating time can be stretched to maybe a day, if you don't do much. Sleep tracking only keeps track of your most recent sleep period. I'm of an age where I get up once or twice during the night, so I lose the earlier sleep sessions. The device seems to follow its own internal operational period, not necessarily related to that of the human wearing it. Don't understand why it needs me to re-enter my passcode ... not  likely someone is going to steal it off of my arm and try using it. An absolute total disappointment ... been using both Fitbit trackers and Pixel phones since their release, but this marriage is a total disaster ... may try one more time after the next release ... hopeful!"
302,Hanfrazee,2,the United States ,3-Nov-22,All other features feel worthless if it can't hold a charge,"I really wanted to like this watch, the petite size is a huge struggle to find in another watch. It even seamlessly worked with my new Pixel phone. But what good is it to me if I can't get through a work day without the battery dying before I'm even home? I have a desk job, in which I might take one walk a day and use an app on the phone once or twice, and the battery has never lasted past 5:00. Last night I charged it to 100% before bed, wore to track sleep... upon waking it was at 60%. Unless you want to charge this needy watch like 3 times a day in order to use the features, then don't bother."
303,whats this!??,2,the United States ,27-Nov-22,Not ready for prime time... No chargering accessories available,"Fitbit fans will love this watch if it wasn't for the lack of accessories for it. Seems like all the cellular companies were not ready to set this watch up as it took over a month of me trying until I gave up for them to get their act together. If you want to buy an extra charging cable for travel, office, or another part of the house..forget about it, they seem to always be out of charging cable.  Love the look, love the idea, but I just think Google rushed the roll out on this based on this."
304,PK,2,the United States ,21-Nov-22,Dismal Battery,"dismal battery life, yet small which is good for sleeping, however, not worth it to me. Got the Galaxy 5 instead. The LTE DID work with Google Fi. Best wait for Gen2.Purchased on Nove 18th, after two days of using it, it went back on the 21st. UPS confirmed that Amazon had it on the 22nd. They did not refund the money until the 28th, choosing instead to print the words: we will refund it when we receive it. Indicates it was stolen to me, if UPS gave me a receipt, then they should update that."
305,Jenni H.,2,the United States ,2-Dec-22,battery life is laughably bad,"I could almost make it through a full day on one charge when the watch first arrived, but a few weeks later the battery life has diminished to a point where it barely makes it 12 hours. The watch itself is mostly fine, but the incredibly poor battery life doesn't make it feasible to be used as intended."
306,Amazon Customer,2,the United States ,27-Oct-22,Ooof this price point has left me more than wanting,"Battery instantly drains though it does charge rapidly. It feels nice when you have the few minutes to wear it. I'm going to give it a week or two to see if somehow a software update will improve the device, but I think they focused to much on quality feel and sleekness instead of actual usability."
307,Samuel Sid,2,the United States ,23-Oct-22,Too too too small for an adult male,Wrist band too small. It literally cut my blood supply to my hand while I was sleeping. What was Google thinking when they made this watch. Did they design this for a child. I love the software and I'm very sad to return this watch that I WAITED to have for ever just to be disappointed 😞
308,Super Surfer,2,the United States ,18-Oct-22,battery won't last no more than 1 day,"I was really excited to get this new smart watch from google.the display and all functions are not notchbut its battery time is killing this device.I've changed full and it last about a daywhich means you will need to charge this every single night.for the price range, I will consider before getting this watch."
309,Barmey,2,the United States ,28-Oct-22,Huge Bezel,"Only reason I bought this was cause I love Ressence watches, but can't afford one. But a Ressence watchface on a Pixel watch might be a good substitute till I can. Well, I gave it a try but this Bezel is lame"
310,Alex Johnson,2,the United States ,15-Nov-22,Not Impressed at all,Screen scratched immediately. Battery life sucks. They should have used better components at this high of a price.
311,Susan Bowyer,3,the United States ,19-Oct-22,"Terrible out of the box experience, but growing on me","Update: I was finally able to pair the watch with my phone and have been using it for a couple of weeks. I love the look of it -- very sleek and it's gotten multiple compliments. Right now, app/tile support is very basic; I look forward to new options being developed as uptake continues *fingers crossed* I'm still docking it a couple of stars for the terrible first impression and appalling Amazon support, but I am warming up to it.Original review below:I've spent over an hour trying to connect this to my Pixel 5a. Most of that time online with Google's tech support, because Amazon's hung up on me! I truly thought this would be easier since my watch and phone are in the same product family, but I'm about to go back to Fossil 😡 Fully disappointed with both Google's product and Amazon's service."
312,forest88,3,the United States ,19-Oct-22,Battery/Google fit,The battery literally was at 100 percent took my dogs on a total wall of 42 mins using Google fit tracker. Came home battery was at 72 percent and I did make a 2 to 3 minute call. The face edit does not allow Google fit to be added onto the screen as soon as I select it it shows then when I edit to my newly edited page the Google fit is gone. I'm a Google guy all year round but the watch is a total let down!!
313,HonestRevs,3,the United States ,27-Nov-22,Lacks Battery Life Compared To Competition,"Since it’s Google’s first watch release, I expected some issues, but the battery life drains faster than expected. The watch seems to be a glorified Fitbit watch instead of Google’s take on their on design from the ground up.Recommending passing on this device."
314,Amazon Customer,3,the United States ,26-Oct-22,Easily scratches!,"Battery lasts about 18hrs and in a whole it's a comfortable and  good watch.But was extremely disappointed to find out it scratched after less than 2 days of ordinary use!""scratch-resistant Corning[R] Gorilla[R] Glass"", right :(Put a screen protector asap!I'm going to keep it but it's such a let down.Seriously Google, you can and should do so much better."
315,Eri,3,the United States ,20-Oct-22,"Nice comfortable watch, but battery life is poor.",Only complaint so far is battery life is poor.
316,Spockwithalightsaber,3,the United States ,2-Nov-22,"After waiting for years, this is disappointing with a splash of awesome","I have been following the rumored release of the Pixel watch for years.  I couldn't wait to get my first one because I just KNEW that Google was taking their time to release the perfect watch.  At the high end of the price point, my confirmation bias justified the expense as the cost of having the perfect watch.And then it arrived.  Sigh.  First of all, kudos to the professional photographers that make it look slim and large.  On my wrist it is very small and bulky.  I can respect the engineering that went into the band so that it swaps the proprietary attachment without tools, but the lack of pins makes the abrupt smallness and chunkiness of the watch even more apparent.  Also, I was excited to finally take advantage of the Google Wear app.  Nope.  This runs on a very basic Pixel App.  I know that new watchfaces are coming, but the ones that are released on the first day are cartoonish instead of whimsical.  Fortunately, you can load Facer and choose more watch faces, but I found the complete isolation from the Wear app to be disappointing.But it is not all bad.  The small screen is beautiful and bright.  I am getting a full 24 hours of charge during moderate use.  The processor in the watch is super fast and responsive.  Things like Gmail are great, finally! you can read the whole message.  But I wish the watch face was larger, and I wish Google had figured out how to use the entire display instead of leaving a tire ring of blackness around the working watch face.I have used it for a week or so now, and have come to appreciate some of the Pixel watch's functionality.  There is a lot to like in this watch.  The apps work beautifully, and the integration of Fitbit software is a nice touch. But if I had to do it all over again, I would have waited for the next version of this watch.  Hopefully, the folks at Google are reading these reviews and will make the next release better. Until then, my advice is to stick with your old watch."
317,gamer,3,the United States ,8-Nov-22,Good for a first draft,"I was really looking forward to buying this watch. I have been disappointed but also optimistic about the future. I really like Google products but lately, I wish we had seen more innovation.Pros:-Works very well with my Pixel 6 Pro and earbuds.-Charges quickly, though could be faster.-Clean and customizable watch faces out of the box.-Good looking design, minus the one small size.-Cons:-I really wish this came in 45mm as the watch just seems so small on my wrist after wearing larger faces for so long. It also makes it harder to enter my code.-No customization for favorite apps. You have to search for the app you want if it wasn't recently used.-Limited apps right now.-Limited bands and Googles are overpriced.-Charge does not last long enough. Could have easily gone with a faster charger too.-THE FACE SCRATCHES VERY EASILY. They should have gone with Saphire glass. I was unable to buy insurance through Google too."
318,Isaac,3,the United States ,7-Nov-22,"What a shame, instead of it bei g dazzling it's a dud","It was google's opportunity to launch pixel watch and hit it out of the park, especially after acquiring fitbit that has a proven track record.But lacking battery life, bugs, proprietary band and its outrageous price are all limiting factors.Get it together Google."
319,Andrea,3,the United States ,22-Oct-22,Just received my Hazel/Champagne Gold Watch - it's silver,"This review is only about the color - I don't know the watch well enough yet to have complaints...except, the ""champagne gold"" is silver on my watch. This is one of their bands that I swapped out (ordered the Linen, and gold the Rose color, but that has been fixed). If you really want gold, you might want to get it in person."
320,Madeline,3,the United States ,16-Oct-22,Beautiful Watch,"Although the first day I hard a hard time connecting it to my Pixel 6, once that bug was fixed it connected with no issue. Notifications, emails, and text appear clear. The biggest issue by far is the battery life...it's worst than the phone. I can use my Pixel 6 for almost 48 hrs with no charge but my watch died after a 18 hr day!!"
321,Txou,4,the United States ,6-Nov-22,An Excellent Smartwatch,"I have owned Galaxy Watches before, Gear S2, Galaxy Watch 3 and 4, all classic variant. I liked those watches a lot, but recently I decided to try Pixel devices and so far I have enjoyed them quite a bit. The phones are great all around but the watch has room for improvement, having said that, this is a great smartwatch.The pixel watch is the prettiest smartwatch I have owned, it is simply beautiful. People complain about the bezel, but the water drop dome glass, truly shines and with the perfect dark on the oled, the bezels for me are simply a none issue. The watch runs smoothly, fast and I have really liked the Fitbit over Samsung Health.Now, the hot topic, battery life. I have been very surprised at some of the things I read regarding battery life. The first two days battery was very bad, but on the third day it became very good, as in, I got the 24 hours or more on it. This is with everything on, including always on display. So, people saying they have to turn off everything and still don't get more than 10 hours makes me think that either the device is faulty or maybe Google needs to fix some runaway bug affecting some devices. Again, always on display on, excercise for 45 minutes, and I still have 50% battery after 14 hours of use. One thing I did change is which apps do send notifications, which might be affecting battery life, but I simply do not need notifications for all my apps.I am happy I gave it a chance even though I read horror stories with battery life because my experience has been very different. Remember, first two days the battery is not great, but it got better for me.Now, something I don't like, it does not support power share, still no third party charging cradles for watch, phone and buds that I know off.Overall, its a solid watch, I recommend it for what it is."
322,Popperganny,4,the United States ,6-Dec-22,Cool smartwatch,I have always been a Fitbit girl. Saw this new Google smartwatch and decided to purchase. So far it's been great and very comparable to the Fitbit except the battery does not last as long which is why I could not give five stars. I do have a routine where I charge my watch while I'm in the shower because the good thing about it is it charges very quickly to 100% and then battery lasts until the next morning.
323,Zachary Miner,4,the United States ,29-Oct-22,"An excellent first watch for Google, but outclassed by its competition for now.","The Pros: This watch is gorgeous. Like Google has done with its entire pixel line, the Pixel Watch has a completely distinct look that sets it apart from others. The battery life was acceptably good (not great), and it did all of the tasks it advertised well.The Cons: The price... It is too expensive when its primary competitors from Samsung have the same features at a cost closer to the 280 mark (versus this watch's 400 dollar price tag). I also hated the fact that they used a proprietary system for their watch bands. (Already a few 3rd party watch bands can be used to fix this problem, but it shouldn't have been an issue in the first place). The main reason I have respected Google so far was for the things it did to STOP proprietary measures (making Android open source, etc.)"
324,Jakob,4,the United States ,21-Nov-22,Great watch that is to small and has to small of a battery,Really like this watch get about 24 hours of battery with it. It is super small which stinks. Wear os 2 had some features os 3 doesn't like ability to fast forward podcasts /media (buttons are grayed out now) also for example on screen authentication worked on os2 doesn't show up on wo3. Speaker is not great...fossil wellness watch was much better along with Samsung watches. Looking forward to a software update where the watch is more responsive to showing me notifications. It feels like it shows on screen 1-2 seconds after you feel the vibration.
325,Max,4,the United States ,28-Oct-22,"Finally, an Android smart watch that fits me.","Most negative reviews for this watch point out it's size and battery life, however only one of these things is an issue for me.I have slim wrists, and this fits like a dream (unlike 99% of android smart watches). The build quality is superb yet not bulky, the screen is vibrant, and the official stretch band makes this the most comfortable smart watch I've ever tried, period.Unfortunately, the battery life while manageable leaves a lot be desired (getting ~20-30 hours with 'always on' enabled, and 'rotate to wake' disabled), and it's overall been very buggy, at this time not even allowing me to connect to staple features such as Google assistant, or pay.I'm positive the software issues will be ironed out with updates, but until then it's quality and size still makes this an ideal pair for my pixel."
326,JoJo,4,the United States ,11-Nov-22,Great watch but the battery life suck,This is a great watch but the battery life suck. I returned mine as instructed and it's not been seen since. The tracking info vanished. The watch vanished so now I'm out of the watch and the 400 dollars I paid for it. I returned it as instructed. I should have followed my mine and delivered it to the hub. I've not had any problems returning stuff there. UPS some my watch. And Amazon set me up.
327,lizamoto,4,the United States ,7-Nov-22,"Excellent all around smartwatch, battery life not the best","The watch is an excellent smartwatch and I love the FitBit integration. Great notifications, great settings, great overall feel. The only downfall to this watch is the battery life, you will have no problem getting through a full day but if you plan on tracking your sleep, you will need to charge it a bit before bed so it will last through the night."
328,L. Thompson,4,the United States ,27-Nov-22,Nice,Nice watch but the the band is maxed out. Wish it came with a larger band. So I'm looking for a bigger one. Batter life is 24 hours plus so no issues there.
329,Mscada,4,the United States ,20-Nov-22,Great watch with disappointing battery life,"Finally a great Android watch with no Samsung bloatware. Unfortunately the power management still needs work. Buttery does not last as long as a competition.Also, need some work on software features. Ex. There is no ability to schedule the bedtime mode."
330,E. R.,4,the United States ,15-Oct-22,"very nice, but small.","everything is almost as it should, it lacks some things, I come from the galaxy watch 4 and there are several configurations, but pure wear OS I love the truth, what if I had wanted it to be bigger, The battery is good, I don't think it will last long but I hope for the best. I would recommend it because if I would recommend it, it is fantastic. One detail the speaker has an unpleasant sound at high volume, I'll see what it is with everything there a month to change it if this is a fault"
331,MNC,5,the United States ,7-Nov-22,more comfortable than Apple watch (bonus tip on Dexcom readings),"I've gone back and forth between Apple and Android, and I've always thought that the best thing about iPhones was the Apple Watch. I've always been disappointed that Android users didn't have a really good smart watch option. But now we do! The Pixel Watch does everything I want it to do, plus it looks great and is very comfortable for my narrow wrists. I have had a few little hiccups, but I expected that since the device is so new. Google will continue to release software improvements, but it's certainly good enough right now.The battery is not ideal, but I can get by with charging once a day. It will charge ~30% quickly but it takes over an hour for a full charge. If you don't need a new smartwatch right now, it might be worth waiting for the second generation so they can improve the battery life.[This advice is posted Nov 2022 and may become outdated very quickly] For my diabetic friends: It is possible to get your Dexcom readings on the Pixel Watch, but it's not out-of-the-box. (That's Dexcom's fault and true for all Android watches). If you want to get your Dexcom readings on your watch, take some aspirin first, and then search Reddit for your options. There are multiple options but I had the best luck with an app called G-Watch Wear App. In the photo of my watchface, the Dexcom reading is the middle circle, and I also have the option to open more detailed info. When I had the apple watch my Dexcom data would fail to update but there was no way of knowing. On the G-Watch app, there is a little timestamp showing when it collected the data. Dexcom refreshes every 5 minutes, so if the timestamp is more than 5 minutes old you may want to check your phone for your most current reading."
332,LB,5,the United States ,27-Nov-22,Great looking watch!,"As a watch enthusiast and the owner of the Apple series 5 watch, I find my Pixel watch round face format more appealing than the typical square watch face. Both watches provide my desired features and have about the same battery capacity (300mah). When using either watch with the settings in airplane mode (no Bluetooth/WiFi) and in the screen timeout mode, both watches lose about 1% of battery capacity per hour. Given that, I consider the Pixel’s battery performance typical of most smart watches and not a problematic issue for me. It takes about a minute for each watch to startup after being fully powered off. The Pixel watch charge rate is about 2.5% per minute. I find it convenient to directly access Goggle Maps on the Pixel watch with just a WiFi connection without my phone."
333,Dustin Ballard,5,the United States ,12-Nov-22,I love it,"I'm kind of new to the smart watch game, but so far... I love it! I've had a Google Pixel phone for quite some time, so I was very excited to get this. The battery lasts all day long for me even without the power saver mode. There was a hiccup where I thought my heart rate wasn't tracking, I quickly learned after a Google search that I was wearing the band a little too tight. I loosened it and it synced up right away. I hope I don't jinx myself but I have not scratched it yet- seems very durable! I love how you can customize the watchface and I'm really enjoying Fitbit premium, it's really helping me get back on track. So happy I picked this for my Birthday present!"
334,swbutt,5,the United States ,5-Nov-22,Really like it.,"This is a great watch that works very well with my Pixel 6 Pro. I had an iPhone 12 and an Apple Watch series 5. Switching to Android was a bit of a learning curve, but so far I'm really happy I made the switch. This watch is a smart watch. Similar to an Apple watch, but different. The controls are a little different, but if that bothers you, then stick with an Apple Watch. This is a first generation Pixel Watch, so don't compare it to an eighth generation Apple Watch. They've had a bit of a head start. I still have my old iPhone 12 and Apple Watch 5 in the closet, but I'm sticking with the Pixel phone and Pixel Watch."
335,Carlton van Putten,5,the United States ,3-Dec-22,Elegantly simple,"I have purchased smart watches from every wearOS third party vendor and this is by far the best UX of them all. Unless you need a lower cost smart watch, there is no reason to look around. Awesome, just awesome."
336,Jessica Richter,5,the United States ,15-Nov-22,Glad I'm not disappointed.,"I spent a while thinking about whether or not I should make this purchase. I was worried that I would regret it, and I'm glad that don't. I keep finding that I'm pleasantly surprised and impressed with its small details and features. The battery life isn't nearly as bad as I was anticipating, it easily makes it through the entire day and doesn't take long to charge back to 100%. I'd buy another one if I had a use for 2."
337,cmith,5,the United States ,21-Nov-22,Great smart watch,Great smart watch. I wear mine all day and night with no issues only charging when I get ready in the morning. This watch may not have multi day battery but it does charge very quickly so I have not ran into any issues of it dying on me.
338,Robin,5,the United States ,16-Nov-22,Love it,I've never had a smart watch before so I have nothing to compare it with. I do like that I can track my exercise and set alarms for things I have to do during the day. Also I have sleeping problems so this helps me work on that. I haven't found anything I don't like about it.
339,Jimmy L. Hinkle,5,the United States ,5-Dec-22,Google Watch is awesome,Google watch is awesome.  Service from Amazon vendor expedient.
340,Rod Husome,5,the United States ,14-Nov-22,Best smart watch I have had. I have had a lot of watches but this one is the best of all.,"Phone is better, ECG is great like all the options on this watch. Much better than my Samsung watch. I have had a lot of other watches this one is by far the best in all categories"
341,Michael H.,1,the United States ,30-Aug-22,It did not meet my expectations for a timex.,Sadly this watch did not live up to the Timex reputation. I have had several Timex watches in the past that were great but the I-connect did not. It would not sync with the app well and was needing to be reset four  or five times a day. I had to constantly put the general information back in just to get basic information. It was returned within 10 days and a different brand purchased. I may have purchased a bad unit or Timex needs to have better quality control or perhaps the app was faulty. Either way buyer beware.
342,James E Davis III,1,the United States ,8-May-22,Horrible,This watch will not be anything like what you want.  This watch is mirepresentd on the description to the point of fraud.  I am surprised that Timex actually put their name on such a sub-par item.  Not a true touchscreen and have to scroll thru all kind if screens to get back to home.  Wrist turn on does not work correctly.  All in all apathetic excuse for a fitness watch.  I will be returning if possible as I a on a ship and will be out of the country for several months.  Spend the money for a fitbit and get a useable item.
343,gloria grimes,1,the United States ,11-Jul-22,Complete disappointment,I was disappointed in this watch.. the raise to lift did not work even after resetting and re-adding device several times.. so they sent me a new watch and I had the same problem except that one the screen wouldn’t come on if I took the watch off for a few hours . I had to put it on the charger to get it to come on and it said fully charged.. so I’m sending that one back .. I’ve ALWAYS owned a Timex watch and never had problems with Timex ever!! Going to try Fitbit ..
344,Shelby,1,the United States ,1-Jun-22,WASTE OF MONEY,"Won't stay connected to phone. Battery life is horrible. Navigation is all ""press and hold"" cr@p. Regret this purchase wholeheartedly, because my watch is very vital to my day-to-day life. This is ABSOLUTELY NOT a 50$ value. Maybe 5$."
345,Rachel Anderson,1,the United States ,22-Nov-21,Watch wont connect to app,"As soon as i opened the app to connect the watch, it acted like it was ""searching"", then would stop, and would just not connect to the watch. Touch screen was not good. Could not get the date and time to change. Not happy at all with it. Returned."
346,AL,1,the United States ,30-Sep-20,Did not work.,"This is the worst watch I have every purchased.  It did not work, it buzzed none stop.  I could not turn it off and it was not easy to use.  I love the Ironman watches by timex but this was a huge disappointment.  I would suggest for timex to stay out of the smart watch industry because this product was a waste of money."
347,Loretta  Blake,1,the United States ,11-Jan-21,Very Bad when you don’t get what you paid for,I got this watch it had to be a used on it didn’t have and instructions on it and it didn’t change so I got this for a gift and it doesn’t work that’s $50 dollars down the drain and why didn’t I get a new watch liked I paid for. Very upset over this
348,Kat (@TheKatChats),1,the United States ,27-Nov-20,Mine came defective,"I didn't even get a chance to use this because the charger was defective. Horrible product, unfortunately, I was hoping to save money and be able to have something to track my steps. You need to have a better charger for this product. Wish I could've given this a zero stars. Horrible."
349,virgen santiago,1,the United States ,21-May-22,Solo duró de uso una semana.,"Es un reloj que se ve muy bonito, pero tal parece de mala calidad. Algo muy raro para la marca Timex. Una pena"
350,VICTOR M.,1,the United States ,19-Jul-21,solo duro 2 semana,"lo compre y se apago antes de los 20 días uso, la barrería es muy deficiente y cuando se apago no pude encenderlo mas, a pezar de que nunca lo deje apagar por carga, creo que es una mala inversión"
351,Chris,2,the United States ,10-Apr-20,Incredibly disappointed. Save up your money for a FitBit.,"I purchased two of these fitness trackers for my husband and I and we were super excited to get them! He already tracks our walks and runs on his IPhone through RunKeeper, but since I don’t have a phone and our gym is closed due to Covid-19, I wanted something to track my calories and mileage.I guess we should have spent the extra cash on an actual Fitbit and not whatever after market thing this is. The look of it is really nice, hence the two stars. But after taking them out for a jog/walk, they did not accurately read steps or miles. We used these watches simultaneously with RunKeeper and Apple Health, the Timex IConnect Actives we’re off by about 2.5 miles and almost 200 calories.The lack of a touch screen is annoying, but the lack of instructions is even worse. The small fold out it came with is laughable.I tried recording my sleep two nights ago and it picked it up fine, so I wore it again last night. This morning when I went to connect it up to the app...nothing. It failed to track my sleep. I wore it the same way I wore the way he the previous night.And oh, the app. FYI, there’s two for the IConnect, and the first one is old and doesn’t work. Timex just hasn’t removed it from App stores. The app that’s supposed to work with these watches is the IConnect 2, but they don’t tell you that any where.There’s no support line for these and when you try to leave feedback through the app, the app crashes. On a new IOS!The watch drops connection from the app frequently, and sometimes to the point where you have to enter in all your initial info in again, which is incredibly annoying.But the whole point of this watch is to be an activity tracker. The app has more activities on it than the watch, so they essentially want you to use the app on your phone instead of the watch?The heart monitor only tracks your BPMs every 30 minutes and seems to be initially inaccurate.The misreading of miles and calories is unforgivable. That’s the whole point of this watch! I don’t care about receiving notifications, (which come through looking fresh outta 2002 Nokia style), I want to track my workouts and jogs.By the way, don’t put weights on your “Sports” part of the menu if you don’t offer tracking weight lifting. Just..why??Pretty disappointed in this product. Would like to return it but the packaging was accidentally thrown out. Don’t be us and save up for a quality product."
352,Art Siegwardt,2,the United States ,31-May-21,Not the best Timex I've owned. Has a few bugs,"I thought about returning the watch but I threw out all the packaging too quickly. The watch itself has a few bugs.The face/screen changes on its own without my swiping the screen. And the phone app sucks. The watch records your heart rate every 30 minutes and you can track your rate on the app. However, my watch seems to record my heart rate even when I'm not wearing the watch. You can also monitor your sleep on the app by wearing the watch to bed, which I really don't do. But to test it I wore it to bed 3 times and had my normal night's sleep. But the Sleep Monitor for those nights has shown that I slept anywhere from 4 to 8 hours. And I've yet to figure out how it keeps track of my steps. The count is so far off from my pocket pedometer (that uses my normal walking stride as 1 step) that I just shake my head in disbelief.By far the worst Timex I've ever owned."
353,Marshall L. Kiker,2,the United States ,15-Dec-19,"not a good value, even at a low price","I wanted to like this. I wanted my nostalgia for Timex to remain and I'm sure Timex is still great but this watch is not. Even at 50 dollars it's just not very good. It doesn't have a touch screen which makes it cumbersome to use. I can get past that but it's the first in a series of issues. There are only a few watch faces but that's ok as one will surely suit most. The app works decently well. It uses a giant persistent notification which seems outdated and most certainly could be removed but it does show info at a quick glance. This watch does at least have the correct date which the non-Active version can't even boast. Any of those factors alone would be acceptable but when you add it all up it just feels like a rip off. I've gotten better watches off wish. I suspect that this isn't a Timex at all as they still make quality watches, even fitness watches without phone integration. This seems like a bad licensing deal that hopefully Timex will let expire when they are ready to build their own watch-os."
354,Gleason,2,the United States ,18-Mar-21,Expected better from Timex,"If you are looking for an active “smart watch”, look elsewhere. Setup was easy but the watch wouldn’t stay connected and now we are not able to connect at all. If the watch isn’t connected to a phone consistently it won’t show accurate time.The watch won’t charge after 1 week of use.Don’t waste your money."
355,Barb Jankowski,2,the United States ,7-Jun-21,Horrible watch,The battery only lasted one day before it ran out of a charge the touchscreen doesn’t work call that’s what I get for buying a cheap watch
356,Linda M Chase,2,the United States ,1-Dec-20,Screen scratches easily,I have only had this watch 2 weeks and it has gotten scratched and has a small crack.
357,Sharon Brown,2,the United States ,6-Feb-20,Okay,It's not overly user friendly but works fine.
358,George Willard,2,the United States ,29-Feb-20,Connectivity,Cant stay connected.
359,Sadie Parker,2,the United States ,30-Jan-20,Way to complicated,"You know how you read reviews sometimes and you can't help but think... some of this stuff just HAS to be user error and it really can't be that bad. Well this is one time that you should really listen to the reviews and get something else. I was so excited to give this watch to my son. He loves my fitbit versa but I just haven't made the plunge to buy him one yet because I'm not sure how well he will keep up with it (hes 12). So this looked like the perfect option. Looked being the key word here. As soon as it came in, I opened it up and began charging it. It charged easy so that was a plus. Then it came time to activating it and setting it up. First you have to be careful and not download the iconnect app but rather the iconnect 2 app. Trust me it makes a huge difference. Once we finally got it going, it was way to complicated to personalize. And WHY did they make a smart watch that isn't touch screen?! What gets me is their older and base models are... but this watch which is supposed to be better isn't! That makes absolutely no sense. So in order to actually use the watch you have to tap the bottom of the watch and then hold it down for 3-5 seconds in order for it to do anything. The watch constantly loses the connection so you have to sync it several times throughout the day. It looks nice and the band is the only reason why I am giving it two stars. the band is nice and sturdy.Trust me, save yourself some time and some sanity and buy something else."
360,SS,2,the United States ,29-Jan-20,Underwhelming.,"Nice features but overall disappointing.The features were underwhelming. The flip wrist to show clock face didn't work consistently and the one button for everything was annoying to use since you have to cycle through all options.  The iConnect by Timex 2 app is the app you use to download your steps and other data and it would drop the Bluetooth connection at least once a day and a couple of the days it dropped several times. I wasn't able to get the connection to pick back up unless I rebooted my phone.I decided to go back to using my Garmin Vivofit 3, since it is more reliable counting steps and remains connected to my phone."
361,Jonny Five,3,the United States ,11-Jul-21,Not what I expected from timex,"The watch bad doesn't fit my wrist, too small of a band at 20mm.  The app is very primative and there is no touch screen, just a spot to tap or press/hold.  The watch face dies not turn on when I rotate my wrist, I need to tap the touch spot to turn the screen on to read the time.  My Timex Expedition Shock does a better job as a time piece."
362,Mr. Chris,3,the United States ,27-Aug-21,Cheap Option,"I purchased this device to track my heart rate, steps, as well as view emails and texts. It does most of those things adequately, but it's just not what I want. For the money it is worth it. But if you want modern tech, this is not it."
363,Jimmy clavijo,3,the United States ,7-Jul-21,It's not what I expected,"I bought it mainly for monitoring my heart rate while I am biking, but unfortunatelly the heart rate monitor display is too small."
364,Michelle Steffe,3,the United States ,16-Mar-21,Not impressed,It did not have a very long battery life.  Had to keep charging it.

373,J.S.White,4,the United States ,6-Feb-20,Nice,The only reason I am giving this watch 4 stars is because it doesn’t stay charged for very long.  I have to recharge about every other day.  Every thing else I really like.  It works great.
374,max neary,4,the United States ,4-Mar-20,"Stylish, nice functions but...",Overall I like the watch.  The only thing i don't like is it only does Military time.
375,HG,4,the United States ,21-Feb-20,Good for the money,display is not bright enough but other features are nice
376,Beverly,4,the United States ,11-Dec-21,Symbol,Does anyone know what the symbol is on the top left. It kinda looks like a paper clip and is on the main time face. It will sometimes have a red dot on the middle. I have ask Timex support and even sent a picture but they have not replied.
377,NaughtiLiterati,4,the United States ,31-Jan-20,"Really cute but no frills, as indicated by the price.","This is not going to give you the bells and whistles of a Galaxy or Apple watch, etc but it does perform basic functions that are helpful to the basic user. It is further an attractive model because of its color design and is easy to connect and pair. I like to use this watch for workouts now instead of my more expensive smart watch because I can keep my stats, etc but not worry about damaging the watch that is so pricey. And FOR the price, it is more than acceptable in performance and aesthetics. I like it!"
378,A. Mitchell,4,the United States ,3-Feb-20,It tells the time,"I'm torn on this review. It's easy to read. It tells the time. It monitors my heart rate. It tracks my steps. IF I leave on the location on my phone, it 'should' update the weather. I haven't received any texts through it. Aside from the above-mentioned features I haven't used anything else. That's mostly because I don't know how to. The app 'looks' user-friendly but I didn't learn anything from it. I wish it came with a user manual. But for what I do get, it's good enough considering the price."
379,DOROTHY C SCHINDLER,4,the United States ,31-Dec-21,NICE FIT BIT!,"I've had several fit bits, and this one is really a nice one.  The screen change is very easy; just a tap away!I mostly use mine to measure the steps, I walk every day.  The notification is an added plus for me as well as the heart rate!  If I HAD to pick a fault, it would the wrist band - not found of the way the edge is tucked under the opposite band.  Other than that - this is one of the best fit bits I've own and you cannot beat the price~!"

381,Jeni,5,the United States ,27-Aug-22,Amazing!!,"I love this watch, it is amazing! Though I have only had it for a day! I am a runner and it will work perfectly; has a stopwatch, counts steps, and tracks distance, perfect for distance running! You can even set your phone up and use your watch to take pictures! Totally worth it!"
382,Valerie,5,the United States ,18-Apr-21,Good watch,The battery lasts a week. The watch doesn’t have a battery indicator on it. The app is easy to use. When I first got my watch the app crashed. Timex fixed the app and now my watch works great. The touch screen is not a true touch screen it is controlled by a touch spot on the watch.
383,Daniel C asco,5,the United States ,22-May-22,very nice thank you,very nice thank you
384,Victoria ,5,the United States ,31-Jan-20,Great watch,"Absolutely love this watch so far! Super simple set up, had to update it cause the notifications and calls weren’t coming through but can easily do that through the app. Can’t go wrong for $50! I have an IPhone and didn’t want to dish out hundreds of dollars for and Apple Watch. You can set reminders to drink water which is great, haven’t figured out the scheduling portion of it but could be useful for someone that needs reminders for meds, to move, etc."
385,Rosemary Prumer,5,the United States ,26-Sep-20,Great watch for the price,Just what I wanted.

387,JGV,5,the United States ,22-Jan-20,Excelente,Recomiendo
388,NJD & DMD,5,the United States ,5-Feb-20,A great alternative to the more expensive version,"We wanted to get our daughter a smart watch for her 12th birthday but didn't want to spend $400 on the ""other one"".  When we saw this, we decided it would be perfect.  A normal watch costs about this much - and this has all the extra features.  As the description states, this features a nice resin strap that's adjustable and fits a large size wrist (as well as her smaller one).  The case of this watch is 37mm which is perfect for the size of her wrist.  The watch face is customizeable and is in color.  You use the iConnect app by Timex and this paired just fine with her iPhone 10.  She doesn't have any social media accounts but she can receive texts, emails, check the weather, control her music - and it also features a heart monitor so when she's in PE or playing soccer she can monitor her heart rate.  The battery can last up to 10 days but we have her charging it every night with the micro-USB cable.  The description states that this watch is water-resistant to a depth of 1.5m for up to 30 minutes - but we don't let her get it wet so not sure about that claim being true or not.Overall, she's very happy with this watch.  It has turned out to be a great alternative to the other one.  You can't beat the price.  We recommend this watch."
389,chicmama,5,the United States ,28-Jan-20,Nice watch easy to use,"Nice watch, easy to pair, I liked it. Easy enough to use, and affordable unlike some other smart watches.  Looks nice too. It wasn't too hard to navigate. A good watch to have."
390,Lisa,5,the United States ,24-Oct-19,Really good fitness tracker/watch,"My husband bought this for me as a gift. I absolutely love it. It's comfortable, was easy to set up and is accurate in counting steps. Ive been able to go 4 days before recharging. May have been able to go more, but I did not turn it off at night."
391,Ilana,1,the United States ,25-May-20,Tells time very well,"I regret buying this. HR is not the most accurate, GPS is extremely out, freezes and my watch just broke. During a workout I'd be doing kettlebell swings and then go straight into burpees, during this high intensity activity my HR registers at 115bpm. After about 45 seconds it only then registers my true HR. Most times, fifteen to twenty minutes into a cycle my HR registers at 89bpm even during intense hill climbs. During covid quarantine I was doing a run on my property in the shape of a heart for a charity. When I looked at the map on the polar flow app I ""ran"" up to 2 streets away when I remained on my property. Sometimes when starting a workout when I try selecting a workout (running, cycling, etc) I cannot start the HR. I touch the screen plenty of times and it doesn't work. I then have to restart my watch which is annoying and time consuming. My watch is only 8 months old. When I tried starting a workout today, as usual I couldn't start my workout by selecting from the activities menu. I tried pushing the back button to start again, my back button didn't work either. All it allows is for me to scroll through the activities, I can't start a workout or go back to the menu. The only thing I can do is restart the watch. I tried twice more and I got the same results. I then tried syncing with my phone, it says couldn't sync. I've been trying to sync on my laptop to update the firmware. Its been syncing for 3 hours. 99% of the time the watch does not wake up when you lift your arm, people probably think I'm crazy lifting my arm up and down, I think I now have tendinitis from that repetitive movement. Jokes aside, most times I have to press the button to wake it up. Let's not even talk about the terrible delayed touch screen. Don't  buy this watch! My useless Samsung was more useful than this piece of junk. I'm so mad! The positive thing about this watch is that it is a watch, it can tell time."
392,EBV,1,the United States ,26-Apr-22,Don’t buy this model!,"Quite possibly the most frustrating tech purchase ever, 1 star because the watch can tell time. As an Apple user I can tell you this is the LEAST intuitive piece of equipment I’ve ever purchased. I bought this to view the equine H10 heart rate monitor, but I don’t think these devices are actually compatible despite the website. There is a newer version of this watch that might work, but this one is absolutely worthless. The watch turns off after 1-2 seconds and you have to shake your wrist or push the button constantly, it does not have a lightbulb (stay on) function as suggested. The touch screen barely works and you will find yourself swiping and swiping with no results. Several hours of almost pairing and almost updating and lost connections just as it’s about to finish with the app (while the phone and watch were sitting next to each) it seems to have partially connected, but there is no functionality within the app, no way to program anything. The H10 monitor was never “found” by the app or the watch despite trying every possible thing suggested by user manual, online manual and support. The functions listed on the support page do not exist. The user manual is utterly useless. Really disappointed and can’t believe I wasted a whole day on this."
393,Amazon Customer,1,the United States ,8-Jun-22,Does not serve the purpose it was designed for,"We have two Polar H9s that we use for workouts (cardio and strength). We use the Polar Beat app and thus far the H9 and Beat has done their job. One issue was during runs where we have to keep referring to our phone to make sure that we were in the right HR zone. So we needed something that would relay the data from the H9 to a more convenient device, e.g. a watch.After researching, it appeared that the Ignite would do the job since it would pair to an H9. We didn't need the optical HR monitor on the Ignite since we needed more reliable HR data. We bought an Ignite and set it up with our H9. First, the Polar Flow app is nowhere near as simple as the Polar Beat app. Second, the Ignite does not appear to keep pace with the H9 monitor and is generally well off even though it is paired.What we thought was a simple solution turned out to be not so easy. The H9 does pair with the Ignite, but the latency of the Ignite in showing the HR from the H9 is very poor."
394,Traci Bates,1,the United States ,16-Apr-22,battery life,my previous watches by this brand have had great battery life but this one is getting down to 10% after just a couple hours. i just took it off the charger and have been laying in bed and it is already at 90%
395,Liz,1,the United States ,3-Nov-21,Not worth it,This watch doesn’t connect to the life fitness machines like the other polar. It also doesn’t accurately or consistently read heart rate. Waste of money.
396,Amazon Customer,1,the United States ,13-Aug-21,Has not worked since day one. Sent back twice always an excuse as to way it  is not working,Cxx
397,Leanne M.,1,the United Kingdom ,27-Jun-22,,"Initially I loved this watch, looks great and connects really easily to my heart rate strap.  However the step counter is so sensitive that when I am typing at my computer it picks up the motion as steps - so I can easily hit 10.000 steps a day without even leaving my house.6 months in and the touch screen function has now completely stopped working.To say I'm frustrated is an understatement, a complete waste of money and I'm so so disappointed."
398,Nael,1,,30-Aug-22,,"Muy caro para lo poco que duró funcionando bien, lo mandé a arreglar antes de que se terminase la garantía y nuevamente vuelve a fallar.Y ni me lo reparan de nuevo ni me dan ninguna solución"
399,Cliente Amazon,1,,8-Mar-21,,"La correa me hace ronchones rojos en la piel, intenté contactar con atención al cliente para ver si otra correa de otro material podría irme mejor y aún estoy esperando respuesta.El GPS a veces funciona y a veces no.Lo que si que funciona bien son las notificaciones, aunque el teléfono tiene que estar bastante cerca.La duración de la batería es malísima, si tienes suerte y funciona el GPS dura un día escaso, si lo utilizas para el gimnasio un día y medio como mucho.La app es malísima, a veces te coge el sueño, otras no, por lo visto tienes que dormir más de 4 horas para que sea considerado como dormir. Si te echas siesta, simplemente lo pone en blanco, pero no te aparecen las horas de siesta.No tiene seguimiento de salud ""femenina"": cuando te va a llegar la regla y demás.Acostumbrada como estaba al de Fitbit, cambié a Polar por la marca y la verdad que este reloj en concreto y la app no valen para nada."

And it fails to synch so many times,  and takes forever doing that."
402,A,2,the United Kingdom ,23-Aug-22,,"Watch works alright but the silicone band irritates skin, both wrists have burn-like marks after only a month. This is.despitey attempts to keep the band clean, I've even tried ph balanced soap with no luck. I've never reacted to silicone before, seems like it could be due to cheap materials"
403,C. Nicholson,2,Canada ,16-Mar-21,,"I bought this as a replacement for my Polar A360 which always worked great. This watch does not work as well at all. It doesn't pick an accurate reading most of the time (often reading in the 90's when I'm out of breath and my heart is hammering). The battery life was ok at first, but now I'm down to having to charge it every two days and that is with notifications and always on heart rate OFF. I was getting two days before with always on ON, which dropped to me having to charge it every day. Also the button on the side you have to push really hard to get it to register. I'm really disappointed in this watch and will likely move to another ecosystem next. On the plus side it does look really nice for an everyday watch.Edit April 28, 20201. Well it was working quite fine when I went to bed last night and I woke up this morning and the screen no longer turns on. The lights are on on the back but either the button isn't working or the screen isn't. This watch isn't even a year old yet, I bought it in May. You have to send the watch away to a repair center for any warranty claim, at my expense it seems."
404,ma hao,2,Germany ,18-Feb-22,,"Nach nicht einmal 2 Jahren ist der Akku nicht mehr brauchbar. Alle 10 Stunden muss die Uhr geladen werden, an manchen Tagen sogar früher. Über Nacht verliert der Akku 35 - 50 % der Ladung. Eine Zurückstellung behebt das Problem nicht und eine Reparatur ist ebenfalls ausgeschlossen.  Von Polar wurde ich dahingehend, mir eine neue Uhr anzuschaffen mit 25 % Ermäßigung. Dabei dreht es sich für mich nicht um die Kosten sondern darum, dass ich gerne eine Fitnessuhr haben möchte, die funktioniert ohne alle 7 -10 Stunden aufgeladen zu werden. Es ist bereits meine zweite Uhr von Polar, die diese Defekte nach nicht einmal 2 Jahren zeigt. Ich rate also vom Kauf von Polar Produkten nicht zu."
405,patrycja,2,the United Kingdom ,29-Aug-20,,"I have read many reviews and opinions and checked many pages before I bought this watch. I was really happy with my previous one M400 but wanted something looking nicer and something where I do not need to worry to take strap to my workouts.This watch looks nice and that's about it. The battery life is horrible I fully charged it in the evening in the morning it's 78%. The heart rate reading is very inaccurate. And sleep tracking pointless - I was in REM phase today when scrolling through Instagram and being awake for 45 minutes. I wish I could switch that off maybe it would save battery life.I am heartbroken writting review like that as I am polar user for 7 years, but honesty it's the worst product I have purchased. If you for a look, you probably can buy nicer looking watch much cheaper all other functions don't work."

412,Brenda,3,the United States ,19-Apr-20,Jury is still out on whether functions justify price,Loses connection and just restarts on its own several times a week.

419,Mirjam M.,3,Germany ,3-Nov-20,,"Vorab:Mir gefällt die Uhr wirklich gut. Und wenn sie funktioniert, ist es spitze. Auch PolarFlow mit den zahlreichen Trainingsansichten hat mich vollends überzeugt.Was läuft gut?- GPS- Signal konstant und genau (besser als bei meiner Vorgängerin von Garmin)- Umgang mit den Daten und deren Auswertung: Synchronisation der Daten und Nutzen der App sowie der HP (Polar Flow), individuelle Wahl der Ansichten (Sportprofile wählbar und individuell anpassbar)- Herzfrequenz, Pacing, etc. läuft alles top (alles, was man als Läufer oder zum Ausgleichstraining benötigt)Warum geht sie trotzdem zurück?Leider ist es bereits die zweite Ignite, die ich zurücksenden muss:(1) Beim ersten Modell hakte der Touchscreen ständig und ohne den geht es bei dieser Uhr einfach nicht.(2) Dieses Modell hat offenbar Software-Probleme, die auch nicht mit einem Zurücksetzen auf Werkseinstellungen zu beheben sind (das war der Tipp vom Polar Support Team): Die Uhr stürzt während der Trainingseinheiten ab, das Starten vorab geplanter Trainigseineiten funktioniert nie und führt immer zum Absturz des SystemsFazit:Da jedoch nicht nur mein Mann, sondern auch zahlreiche Freunde Polar nutzen und vollends zufrieden sind, gebe ich dem Unternehmen trotzdem noch eine Chance.Ob ich mich jedoch wieder auf die Ignite einlasse oder es doch mal mit der höherwertigeren (aber auch teureren) Vantage V2 probiere, weiß ich noch nicht. Denn vorangegangene Rezensionen in diversen Foren legen nahe, dass die Ignite einfach fehleranfälliger als die anderen Modelle ist."
420,rarmonna,3,Germany ,1-Jun-20,,"Ich hätte die Polar Uhr gerne behalten, denn mir hat Design und Tragekomfort sehr zugesagt. Sie ist intuitiv zu bedienen, die zugehörige App bietet nicht nur die Darstellung der gesammelten Daten, sondern auch gleichzeitig verständlich erklärte Analysen. Zudem sammelt die Uhr erstmal Daten, bevor sie Empfehlungen ""ausspricht"".Allerdings waren meine Pulswerte ziemlich besorgniserregend und bei einem Abgleich mit Pulsgurt war klar, dass die Werte so nicht stimmen konnten. Da ich die Uhr zum Training gekauft habe, war sie für diese Funktion nicht geeignet. Auch das Schlaftracking fand ich sehr praktisch, allerdings auch etwas ungenau.Seine zurückgelegte Strecke kann man per GPS aufzueichnen und so z.B. nachschauen, an welcher Stelle der Puls besonders hoch oder niedrig war. Allerdings war das GPS nicht immer präzise, aber wahrscheinlich ausreichend.Auch die Smartwatch-Funtkion ist gut, da man Anrufe oder Nachrichten auf der Uhr empfangen kann. Negativ ist der schwache Kontrast des Displays, vor allem im Sonnenschein."
421,Heather Hill,4,the United States ,18-Sep-21,Seems to be the right mix,"First, a word of warning: this is going to be a long review.  I have a lot to say about smart watches/activity trackers.Secondly, here's what is important to me in a smart watch/activity tracker.  First, it has to be pretty simple to use.  I am a technological idiot.  Secondly, I need an accurate calorie count and ability to track numerous kinds of exercise, but not every activity under the sun.  Thirdly, I want it to look nice, have onboard (accurate) GPS, and have a decent online app.  If you are a techno wizard or a marathoner/triathlete, you can stop reading this review now, because you and I have very different needs. If you are like me, here's the short version: I have been wearing this watch for just over 24 hours and can say that it meets most of my requirements, and I am still determining whether it meets the last two: GPS accuracy and online app.By way of background, I have had about 6-7 different Fitbit devices since approximately 2017.  After starting with 3 Ionics (first two lasted about 11 months and were replaced for free by Fitbit because they were still under their 1-year warranty), I downgraded to a Charge because Fitbit wasn't going to replace my third Ionic for free and I wasn't going to spend more than $200 on a device that lasted 9-11 months.  I have been through 4 different Charge devices in the past 2-3 years.  So, I needed a more durable device.  So, in June I bought a Garmin Venu Sq.  Um, see technological idiot comment above.  I had no idea how to work that device.  Nor did I need things like cross-country skiing preloaded on my device.  I have not gone cross country skiing in like 20+ years. I run about 3 miles, bike between 15 and 25, swim, do yoga, and lift weights.  I am battling the over-40 waistline expansion and need to have an accurate calorie count for my activities, so I have a better idea how many calories I should be eating.Enter the Polar Ignite.  It's so pretty!  And I put it on and had figured out how to  track an activity in like 5 minutes.  It has all the activities I need pre-loaded without a crap-ton that are irrelevant to me.  So far (after a walk, a swim and a bike ride) it seems to not do the things that annoyed me about my Fitbit Charge, i.e. turning off GPS or just stop recording an activity in the middle of the activity for no reason.  It also has a much more accurate calorie count (based on what was my norm on the higher quality Ionic, what I get from treadmills that allow me to enter my weight/age, and online calorie burn estimators) than the Charge did, which I am presuming is because there appears to be 4-5 different heart rate sensors on the Polar, vs. one on the Charge.Now, I set everything up on the watch itself rather than my phone because I currently have a seriously old and barely functional phone.  So, I have not been able to use the app yet and can't speak to that.  I did really like Fitbit's app, so that is a comparison that is yet to be seen.  I also am not entirely sure if I properly turned on the GPS when I went for a bike ride today (I have not even opened the use manual, as everything thus far has been very intuitive).  If I did, the GPS was more than a mile off.  That will be annoying if it turns out to be true.  I always take my phone with me on outdoor runs/bike rides for security purposes, but it's a lot harder to check that during exercise than it is to look down at my wrist.  So, if you have read this far, expect there to be an update once I have a new phone and can use the app and have read the user manual to make sure I am properly turning on the GPS."
422,Kaneisland,4,the United States ,1-Aug-21,Wrist-based HR is 10-20 bpm off (10-20 bpm too fast),"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I use this HR watch with Polar H10 chest sensor during workout, mostly Les Mills classes. With H10, this watch works great. Without H10, HR is way off. This watch does not utilize H10 if it is not set for a workout mode. So, if you want to record your sleep HR, you will get extremely inaccurate HR because this watch does not use H10 sensor in the sleep mode. I suspect that ""Fitness test (VO2 Max)"" also relies only on the wrist-based HR sensor. So, the VO2 Max could be off, too. If you want accuracy, use this watch with H10. The accompanying video shows this HR problem. In this video, I am just walking on a treadmill. Ignite shows ""green"" circle HR (wrist-based), then switches to ""blue"" circle (H10 sensor)."
423,Emily,4,the United States ,24-Apr-21,Great for run & bike,"This watch is great for tracking sleep, running and cycling. It does not accurately track my swim and as an aspiring triathlete, this was the sole purpose of this watch. Not totally satisfied."
424,Jim,4,the United States ,21-Mar-20,"Very good product, works well","Gave this as a present, very satisfied customer"
425,Carlotta,4,France ,6-Sep-22,,"La montre est fonctionnelle, le point négatif est que le GPS ne fonctionne pas en natation eau libre,  pas de problème pour les autres sports"
426,Martina ,4,Italy ,26-Mar-20,,"Avevo letto molte recensioni negative su questo SPORTWATCH ma, attirata dal marchio e dal design - in quanto lo cercavo proprio rosa - non ho esitato oltre e ho deciso di acquistarlo. Non sono nuova ai prodotti Polar, ho anzi constatato che rileva bene o male gli stessi Bpm della fascia da braccio polar OH1, conoscevo già anche le zone di FC.Penso che le critiche di molti derivino dal fatto che alcuni pensavano di acquistare uno SMARTWATCH. Questo è uno SPORTWATCH, documentatevi sulla differenza e se cercate uno smartwatch cambiate prodotto.Avevo letto giudizi negativi sul cinturino: smentisco. Non è affatto rigido, anzi è morbido e non fa male durante l'allenamento né indossandolo costantemente.Do indicazioni sulla misura S/M, in quanto quello rosa è disponibile solo di questa misura: il mio polso è giusto 180mm e avanzano molti fori per chiuderlo.La batteria mi sta durando in media 3-4 giorni, considerando che ho la sincronizzazione attiva e che mi alleno almeno 4 volte a settimana.La sincronizzazione permette di visualizzare le notifiche delle app sullo sportwatch, ma non di rispondere tramite esso. Appunto non è uno smartwatch, ribadisco.Cercavo uno sportwatch che fosse femminile, con il quadrante tondo ma allo stesso tempo funzionale e sebbene se ne trovino altri in commercio con un design simile, questo è decisamente di un certo livello considerando il prezzo contenuto. È molto molto elegante e fine!"
427,originaltebas,4,,14-Dec-20,,"Siempre usamos polar y este era regalo para mi esposa que tenía un m430. Y la verdad que el salto ha sido espectacular. En estética, cantidad de datos en fitness, gym y sueño que es lo que más usa ella es tope. Es casi todo perfecto excepto que la pantalla es muy lenta al encenderse. Se supone que se enciende con el giro se la muñeca pero tienes que espera unos 3 o 4 segundos a que reaccione y a veces tienes que repetir el giro. Una pena, porque es un muy buen reloj."
428,Ewa Olinkiewicz,4,the United Kingdom ,5-Mar-20,,"Generally … I am happy with this watch but …. I bought it as an upgrade from M430 and I was expecting it will be only better than M430 but...  it is NOT! Of course there are some super features that I am very happy with i.e. FitSpark, sleep tracker, serene, not mention the LOOK itself - LOVE IT! but I still think that M430 was a better watch, If I have a look of Polar Ignite in M430, that would have been my dream watch :)"
429,Cliente Amazon,4,,14-Apr-21,,"ES muy bueno, lo único que no me gusta es el contaje de pasos ""no real que hace"", cuenta cualquier movimiento de. muñeca aunque estes sentado, polar dice que es porque computa cualquier movimiento que tenga gasto energético, no se. Pero en ejercicio activo es muy preciso. Me gusta mucho."

431,Natalia,5,the United States ,24-Jul-22,Amazing!!,"I love it! It has worked perfectly for me. I have used it for different sports (running, swimming, weights and treadmill). In all of them has been really accurate. I'm a Polar fan now. So useful for my marathon training."
432,Nina,5,the United States ,8-Aug-20,Love it,"I have been a polar fan since a while, I changed my A370 for this and I love it. The watch is very nice and doesn’t look “sporty” as other models. It’s a watch that you can use everydayGpsI read some bad reviews about the gps. it’s not 100% but fair enough , it has the route and in some place it’s a bit out but not that bad.The watch get the gps signal very quick the first use and then, no problems from the next ones.UseIt’s easy to use, the screen size is perfect and during and after the workout you can see a lot of details on screen.The sync with Polarflow was quick and easy dame as the first time setup.BatteryIt lasts 3 full days without constant HR checking and 1.5/2h workout at day. It takes around 1 hour to fully charge"
433,Nicolette,5,the United States ,8-Apr-21,Exactly what I needed!!,"I'm beyond happy with this product. It seems very accurate. I love the constant heart rate monitoring. I strength train and do HIIT and my biggest concern was how it would do during HIIT workouts and it is seems to be amazing. I'll update if things change, but so glad I got this. Key is to wear it farther up your arm than a watch. So it is awkward to get used to, but still comfortable."
434,Rams Moon,5,the United States ,23-Nov-20,Perfect for someone who is active,"Love this watch, it does exactly what I bought it for and more. I am not much a of a watch wearer but have been able to wear this one around the clock with no issues. And the sleep tracking has been an eye opener."
435,Christina,5,the United States ,9-Jul-21,Great!!,I love the accuracy in tracking my calories and heart rate when I workout.

437,Cathy Troiano,5,the United States ,8-Feb-20,Nice watch,"More accurate heart rate reading with a chest strap, but over all very happy with the purchase"
438,R. Hamilton,5,the United States ,16-Oct-22,Use a chest strap if you need accurate hr with ANY fitness watch.,"My husband gave me this watch as an anniversary present a few years ago. I was already using the Polar a300, which I still use today. I wear the Polar Ignite and use it a lot. It's very comfortable on the wrist, has continuous heart rate monitoring which is more accurate than other watches of its kind, and an excellent battery life. The only thing I dislike about this watch is that the inactivity alert simply does not work. I can sit for hours and it will never ding me.I've been through cardiac rehab twice. We wear a full-on ekg while working out in cardiac rehab. Just for fun, we compared the wrist-based heart rates we were getting from our watches with the ekg readings. Long story short, if you want an accurate hr, use a strap. The only things that were close to the ekg were the Polar h10 strap and the Polar h7. They will get within a few bpm of an actual ekg with 5 leads, which I consider fantastic.Wrist-based watches were as much as 20 bpm -- or more -- off. I abandoned my Polar a370 over this. I would do the same with the other name-brand wrist-based heart rate monitors. The Ignite is quite a bit closer than a370; close enough for most people.I use my fitness watches for the serious business of making sure that my heart doesn't go blasting off into an excessively high heart rate and get me in big trouble. Everything else is non-essential. I also use it to track my workouts in a more general sense, remind me to move when I've been sitting too long, as an alarm, and, of course, as a watch to tell the time. I also like to know how long I slept and if I tossed and turned a lot. I don't care about the other things the watch does.The Ignite does all those things, with the exception of telling me when I've been sitting for too long, very well. When I work out, I use a chest strap, even though the Ignite does have continuous heart rate monitoring which is really pretty accurate, because I want the extra accuracy of the strap. I like the Polar straps because they are accurate. I wouldn't buy a watch that didn't sync with one of these straps.To be honest, there are things about the old, out of production Polar a300 that I prefer. I like the way the Polar a300 reports the zones for my workout and the reports of whether I burned calories with fats or carbs. I also think it's activity tracking is more accurate than the Ignite's. The most important difference is that the inactivity alert on the a300 works perfectly. I really need that reminder to get up and move around to help me get healthy. I often end up wearing the a300 instead of the Ignite because of this.I lean toward Polar watches because of their hr straps and also because they are more fitness and performance oriented and don't get off in the weeds as much as other fitness trackers. I don't think any wrist-based hr on any watch of any brand is accurate enough for someone with an actual heart problem. But I think anything will work if you're a healthy person, just trying to get in shape without killing yourself.The Polar Ignite is a good watch. I like it and use it. It's light weight, feels good on my wrist and has the same Polar durability I've found in every Polar watch I've owned, beginning with my ancient, but still working perfectly ft4.But if you want/need an accurate hr, it doesn't matter what watch you buy, you've got to use a strap."

441,VACME,1,the United States ,5-Dec-22,This fitbit was a mistake,"I regret purchasing this Fitbit Inspire 3.The silicone wrist band is uncomfortable when worn all the time.  For something that is supposed to be wearable tech, they really should consider comfort when worn for extended periods.  The wrist band is not breathable, so moisture builds up and gets trapped on your wrist.  There are no woven fabric bands available on the Fitbit website or on Amazon from third parties. Oh, and the mechanism to release the band from the device is peculiar, so it would not be easy to create a homemade wrist band solution.  There is a metal mesh band for $60.00 available on the Fitbit website, but I do not trust Fitbit with another  $60.00 to deliver on comfort.  After all, metal is not breathable, and who knows if the metal mesh band will be as uncomfortable as the silicone band.  So grade F for comfort.Customer service is nice and friendly, but ultimately not helpful in terms of a solution. So grade B for customer service.I wanted something that would be a good pedometer for using to track steps while on my under-desk treadmill.  If I wear it on my wrist while working and walking on my treadmill. it does not count my steps.  I bought a leg band from a third party and popped it in there so that it would count my steps, but it counts way more steps than I take, so it is not accurate when on my ankle.  I have ordered a clip accessory to clip it to my waist to see if the accuracy improves, but honestly, I think it should be comfortable and work with a better degree of accuracy, and it just doesn't.  So, grade C- for accuracy.The app is ok, but it can only be as good as the accuracy of the device.  Naturally, you must create an account and they want to charge you monthly to upgrade to a premium account.  So every time you open the app it sends you to a splash screen to upgrade.  Annoying.  The sleep data is interesting, but who knows how accurate it is.  If it is as accurate as the heart rate monitor or step counter, then you may as well consult a psychic about your sleep quality.  Better yet, check in with your self about how rested you feel when you wake up:  the proof in the pudding, so to speak.  Data is kept in the cloud, and Google bought up Fitbit, so it makes one wonder about privacy.  Fitbit says they do not share your data, but one cannot help but wonder if customers are being surveilled and monetized.  So grade C for a passable ok  app, downgraded to a D- due to data privacy concerns.I am glad I bought an entry lever Fitbit instead of a more expensive one.  Overall it was a waste of money, but at least it was not a waste of a lot of money.  If you do not have $70.00 to throw away, take a pass of Fitbit.  I am waiting for the waist clip to decide if I am going to return it.  If it can accurately count my steps with a waist clip, then I will keep it.  Otherwise, I will return it, if it is not too late.  Either way, I would not endorse the product."
442,Amazon Customer,1,the United States ,12-Nov-22,Lack of services,"I have had this watch for about two weeks. I purchased it to replace my Apple Watch that had stopped recognizing when it was on my wrist and therefore needed to have the passcode entered constantly. I find this watch is a poor comparison to the Apple Watch and I didn't like the Apple Watch much to begin with. It has low functionality - there are very few exercises that it auto tracks - there is a catch all called 'workout"". You can't (intuitively) switch songs being played via bluetooth headphones when working out - something I could do with my Apple Watch. It also takes a bit of tapping to wake up the device  - all in all it feels like a beefed up pedometer - not at all what I was expecting based on other review.Oh! One more thing - there is no 'find my watch' setting in the app on the phone which is also frustrating."
443,feak,1,the United States ,27-Oct-22,Not fit for purpose - Can't measure heartrate,"This thing fails at its most basic and core feature. Measuring heart rate.I bought this *just* for that. I need a quick gauge on heartrate while working out. All the additional bells and whistles are nice to have, but not my primary need. Well, it can't even do that.I tried everything recommended.- Inside/Outside the wrist- Higher/Lower on the wrist- Tighter/Looser band- Left/Right hand- Changing to exercise (workout) modeNone of those things seemed to make a difference. The readings were intermittent and inaccurate. Especially above about 100 BPM. Often while working out, there's no reading at all. Other times, the reading is way high or low. When I'm working out hard, I can easily get up to 165+ BPM (measured through multiple means). This thing reads like 120-130 at that point.This thing is junk."
444,Sterling A.,1,the United States ,17-Nov-22,She broke my heart...,"From the first time I put her on it was like magic. I had an inspire 2, but the 3 felt; it just felt right. The new features were impactful, display was fluid.  But alas, twas the third day I had her, I woke up one day and she was gone. Fuzzy lines appeared on the display. I tried to save her. Reset after reset. I waited by her side day after day; hoping she would come back to me. But no. Sometimes I look over to the corner where she lies. I know she's alive, but disconnected from me. Her leaving took away a part of me.And that was the end of the inspire 3 and me."
445,VIVIAN JOHNSON,1,the United States ,22-Nov-22,Disappointed,Received this package in the mail today. So disappointed do to the fact that I'm not sure the fibit will work at all. The weather was extremely bad today raining all day. The postmaster left the package in the designated area so I'm not blaming him for the package being damaged. I do fill that the package should've been mailed inside a waterproof package and placed in the mailbox. Everything inside the box was completely soaked. Not a happy camper charger doesn't work or the fibit doesn't work 70.00 dollars gone down the drain.
446,Jon Lemasters,1,the United States ,14-Nov-22,spo2 doesn't work,"I bought this specifically for the spo2 function. After 3 days it is still not working. The instruction say to use an spo2 clockface. It is not available in the gallery. The stand alone app just says ""no data"". I had an old charge 2 that I used for years and really liked. I am returning the Inspire 3. Also in the app the graph for sleep is gone and there are now 3 different things for parts of sleep."
447,Sharon Smith,1,the United States ,22-Oct-22,This is a fraudulent company. Do not buy the Fitbit watch.,"This is a trick to get credit card info. I chose the FREE option setting up my Fitbit watch, and then received an immediate text from my credit card company that an attempt was made to charge my card $39.95. I declined it, but people need to know that this requires the Tudum app, owned by Netflix, and an internet  search showed how many, many, many people this has happened to. I wonder if Amazon reads these notes and does anything about it."
448,Amazon Customer,1,the United States ,3-Nov-22,Worthless,"Can't hold a charge for even one day, and with an additional charging cable, just one more bit of jumble to travel with. If I had realized the charger was not a ""C"" cable I NEVER would have bothered with this. I hate returning things, but this is going back immediately."
449,Rogelio R.,1,the United States ,12-Nov-22,This is ass,"Over priced step counter. Not good for anything else. HR is way off, was sweating my butt off on treadmill with treadmill tracking my HR at 150/155. The inspire 3 was at 99/100. Do not buy"
450,Marcia,1,the United States ,15-Nov-22,It stopped working,"First, it appeared that it was damaged, scraped or something on the face. Now it's not working at all! I just charged it. I can see somehting on my phone but the physical unit has stoppedworking."
451,GB,2,the United States ,10-Nov-22,A dud,"Does many things, except what I need. It's important to be able to track my heart rate, given my age and family history. This has not done so for two days,including during a heavy HIIT class. I also have insomnia, and its important to be able to track my sleep. I get up a few times a night to use the bathroom. Once that happens,sleep tracking seems to stop. I also find it difficult to navigate the watch face. It really seems to tell me very little, except the time. And I do love the ability to find my phone as I lose it constantly. I will continue to try this device for a few more days, but it will be returned if I can't use the features for which I paid"
452,Goth Annie,2,the United States ,29-Nov-22,Can't change out the band,"For the life of me, I couldn't get any other band to function. The one that's included left red, tender skin. My other fitbit did as well so I changed to a cloth band and was fine. This one comes with a tiny metal piece that flies off and gets lost. Sure, I buy an exact replacement, now it's not going back on (with the replacement or other original metal locking piece.) It's just not user friendly and not worth the hassle (see any comment on the replacement bands- it's really annoying.) I miss the easy snap in system."
453,Lucy leasure,2,the United States ,30-Nov-22,Can someone help me,Inspire 3 will not hook up to my fitbit app.. I've spoke to fitbit help n have done everything they have said to do! So frustrating..I have a galaxy flip 4..seems to me it's not the app it's the inspire will not even turn on when charged ..help
454,Amazon Customer,2,the United States ,4-Dec-22,"Does not track stairs, doesn't sync without hassle, annoying features that pop up onscreen",This is not the product I hoped to get. The syncing feature doesn't always work and requires turning on and turning off Bluetooth. It doesn't track stairs properly. It has really annoying popup messages on the screen that get in the way of seeing the number of steps.
455,Allan N.,2,the United States ,30-Oct-22,Watch band keeps separating from the watch,"It’s a great watch, but the band keeps detaching from the watch (3 times).  Fitbit will have to prefect this defect in the workmanship of the band before I buy another one.  I went on Fitbits website and it is full of these issues.  This is why I gave the review two stars."
456,Amazon Customer,2,the United States ,21-Nov-22,Failed to record oxygen and pulse rate,Unfortunately it failed to record or sense oxygen or pulse rate.  Otherwise very acceptable.  I returned the item.
457,Nathan,2,the United States ,4-Dec-22,Some features are good but overall disappointing,"This tracker is pretty basic. I like the steps and active minutes features. I find most of the other functionality to be more of a curiosity, but some may like it. There is one feature, though, that really disappoints - exercise tracking. I got this device to track my runs. I start and stop it manually (I do not use the auto detect). About 50% of the time it stops mid-run so I do not get useful statistics. I don't know my distance, pace, or time. This is really unfortunately and makes the device only marginally useful for me. I don't know if it's the hardware that is buggy or the software, but if you need to do exercise tracking, this is not the device."
458,Cookie,2,the United States ,21-Oct-22,Not acceptable,"When I look at my watch, I want to see time, steps, pulse. With this one, I often get  something else. Then I need to use 2 fingers to swipe the sides to see what I want to see! Waste of time! I don't always have an available second hand!"
459,Betsy Fowler,3,the United States ,4-Dec-22,Fitbit Inspire 3 not as accurate as Charge4/Charge5,"This is an attractive and slim device with great battery life and useful features.  The Inspire 3 kept accurate track of my steps but unfortunately the heart rate data never proved  to be accurate, reliable or consistent, so I never got any useful sleep statistics  This is just as important to me as the step data, so I had to abandon the device.  Others may have a better experience.  (I had previously owned a Charge 4, which always gave me accurate heart rate data, but I was forced to replace it when the strap-clasp failed.)"
460,Ruth Wegman,3,the United States ,22-Nov-22,Not as nice at older Inspire HR,"I really liked my Fitbit Inspire HR 2, but after 3&1/2 years it became very difficult to recharge. I ordered the Inspire 3, but am not as happy with it. I miss the clicker on the side and have to use two fingers to wake it up. The charger is not magnetically attached. The band is stiff. The pages when I scroll don't distinguish themselves as easily, but often stop mid-page so I see parts of two on the screen. The one new feature I really appreciated is the Find Phone, but this only works intermittently. Disappointing!"
461,Vicki Rizzo,3,the United States ,4-Dec-22,No charging cube power plug included,"The seller should have advised that the charging cube power plug part was not included and had to be purchased separately. That is a huge oversight. I supposedly purchased a new Fitbit. Since there were items missing, was this refurbished and misrepresented as new? The app is also difficult to use. There is no tutorial to assist a new user."
462,Seattle WA,3,the United States ,28-Oct-22,inaccurate step counting,I ordered one of these about a year ago and returned it because the step counting was so far off.  Lots of reviews about this which I did not see before purchasing.  I needed a replacement for my zip so I purchased it again.  I only need a step counter.  The way it's going this morning I will have walked a mile before leaving my house.  That's 2000 steps compared to the 400 steps logged on my zip.  My first time using the app and I love it!!  I just look at my phone instead of the device clipped at my waist.
463,nejiwhopper,3,the United States ,26-Oct-22,Band comes undone easily,"I only just received this this afternoon.  I was watering my house plants, not bumping into things or doing anything strenuous; I look down and see that the one side of the band came completely off from the watch!! Thankfully I noticed it before it fell off my wrist.  Hopefully this was just a one time fluke. I'd hate to loose it."
464,Splashm,3,the United States ,16-Nov-22,Good all around tool,Product has longer life than the others. Has quite a bit of useful tools as wake-up alarm etc.  Bright at night.
465,M. Scarborough,3,the United States ,17-Nov-22,Virtually No Third Party App Support,If you are buying any Fitbit product with the idea of using it as a Bluetooth heart rate sensor for your favorite training app then forget it.  Do yourself a favor and buy a Polar chest strap sensor or Bluetooth arm sensor.
466,L. Julow,3,the United States ,12-Oct-22,Won’t read bpm,"For some reason neither the charge five nor this inspire three will read my heart rate, no matter what I do or troubleshoot.  Which renders it fairly useless, because a lot of the features on the app go by your heart rate. I also prefer to set my silent alarms through the app, but it appears to be gone and you have to do it directly from the device now. I’d go back to my inspire two but it’s faded so much I cannot read the time unless it’s dark in the room. The original charge 2 I had is still usable the inspire I’ve had to replace yearly. I’m not super impressed, but I do like the smaller footprint of them, however if it’s not going to work past giving me the time I may need to switch companies or go back to a standard watch.Update. I’ve discovered that the newer Fitbit’s cannot read over tattoos something about a switch to one light when the older ones used two. This would have been nice to know and should be mentioned in general."
467,L. Welch,3,the United States ,14-Oct-22,Can’t feel vibration,I got this mainly as a silent alarm. It he vibrations can be heard but can’t be felt as they mainly vibrate the top and not the part touching your wrist. The app only lets you change a few things. I was hoping I could program alarms there on a bigger screen.
468,Fernando,3,Mexico ,4-Dec-22,,"Esta es mi tercera pulsera fitbit y me gustan mucho porque las uso todo el día, pero esta nueva versión 3, me está dando problemas de conexión, además a veces no me da información de oxigenación en sangre, la siento inestable no se si sea porque va saliendo y requiere algún firmware o coincidió con el nuevo sistema operativo del iPhone, espero se resuelvan los inconvenientes porque me gustan bastante los productos fitbit"
469,Clark,4,the United States ,5-Dec-22,Worth the sale price.,"I bought a generic step tracker last year and it was effective but it never updates my weight. So I bought Fitbit inspire 3 on cyber Monday. So far it's great except 1 thing... Fitbit by Google doesn't connect to Google fit! I mean seriously every other fake, free, generic fitness and weight loss app on my phone connects to Google fit EXCEPT Fitbit! Which literally says on the box ""by Google"". If they fix this I think I'd give it 5 stars. Oh, and I'm not the most tech savvy person but how do I turn off the 'activity reminders'?"
470,Will,4,the United States ,6-Nov-22,Works fine but some charger connection issues,"This is a good fitness tracker/watch that seems reasonably accurate. I'm not a fan of the watchband material but it's comfortable and seems sturdy. The problem is the charger attaches to the watch with two small plastic clips, not magnets like many other watch chargers. As a result the charger often loses contact with the watch so it is not charging. It looks like it's properly in place but it may not be. It is touchy and easily loses the connection. And the charger cord is short, about 9 inches or so. Once you do get it connected properly and positioned in a way that it stays connected it charges quickly. The battery life is very good so you only need to charge about once a week."
471,titetot,4,the United States ,20-Nov-22,doesn't count steps IF you walk slowly.,"I bought this watch because I have sleep apnea and like to keep check on my SPO2 at night.  This doesn't do a very good job of this.  Also doesn't keep track of length of time slept.  I have to use the alarm clock setting to get reminded to take my pills.  Have had better watches at a lower price , but they didn't last long.I do like that I can clearly see the time and the date.  I also like how it looks and it is comfortable to wear."
472,nakanoquinn,4,the United States ,5-Dec-22,A step up from the last model,"More fashionable without being too big, a good, long battery life, and more activity than the previous inspire. Definitely worth getting the new model!"
473,sleep__witch,4,the United States ,1-Dec-22,Pretty Great,"Bought this to more accurately count my steps, it's way better than trying to keep my phone on me! This is exactly what I was looking for, and the app works pretty well too."
474,Andrea Mike Thomas,4,the United States ,5-Dec-22,So far so good,It has been interesting to see how sleep patterns and pulse runs. Keeps me moving with notifications of close to goals.
475,Blabla,4,the United States ,22-Oct-22,Surprisingly I really like it!,"It looks better on my hand than I expected. It's small enough that band doesn't bother me when I sleep.Overall I'm pleasantly surprised with the overall experience and the that value this product delivers. Simple and does what it's supposed to.I deducted a star because the software has alot of opportunity to be better. I hope that with Google owning Fitbit they can make it happen. Nothing wrong with it, I just know how good it can be.Overall I would recommend this device if you want something simple to track you activities and sleep at a very good price."
476,David Benson,4,the United States ,28-Oct-22,Fitbit is my friend now,I really like my fit bit. I had a charge 2 for over 4 years. It got to be my friend. It was with me 24/7/365. It quit working while I was traveling in Eastern Europe. I felt like my friend had died.  When I got home I bought an inspire. It’s too small and delicate for me. I’m a 74 year old man and my fingers are having trouble with the band etc. I will probably buy myself a change 5 for Christmas.
477,sharon thomas,4,the United States ,4-Dec-22,Good,Needed to charge once so far.
478,Donna G. James,4,the United States ,14-Nov-22,Great tool to help you get motivated.,Love the notifications feature that reminds you to get active. It looks nice. The only drawback is it's hard to read the tiny icons and lettering if you are over 50.
479,Blpen,5,the United States ,28-Nov-22,Great reasonably priced health tracker,"Love this fitbit.  I had the previous model - Inspire 2 and while it worked well it had one fatal flaw - the screen was way too dim and only got worse over time.  This one is MUCH brighter.  Large numbers on face and very bright make it easy to see and read in all types of lighting.  Does not have GPS, but that doesn't bother me, because the app gets the GPS from my phone.  It has all the great features - step counting, able to count different types of exercise, like biking, swimming, etc.  Keeps track of your sleep data, heart rate, when you are burning calories, etc.  The app also lets you keep track of food intake for calorie counting.  It is a great model for a reasonable price."
480,Matilda,5,the United States ,6-Nov-22,Cannot Decided,"Nothing at alll to dislike. Just have to decide on Inspire 3 Lilac or the Luxe. Luxe would be my 2nd one as 1st quit after 18mos. Inspire 3 clock choices are outdated & not even close to what Luxe offers. With right band /clock face my old Luxe was mistaken as jewellery.Inspire 3 has alt bands (fewer stylish choices 😞 on Amazon than other places ie E*ty  or ..by) but even the nicest here won’t make it as the Luxe.Pros: Due to a slight configuration it stays better on wrist, feels more comfortable than Luxe. It’s just short enough it doesn’t feel as if you want the tracker to curve. If you have small wrists it can be nice to not always feel like it doesn’t shape correctly to your wrist. The Lilac/Black is very pretty & while band looks exactly for what it is, comfortable, prettier colour than photo & will go w many styles of dress. Big PRO is display & side sensors that turn display on & off vs Luxe ability to never awaken as it’s supposed to & your hands are full.  How many do the Luxe Nose or Forehead tap to see the time?If I could just go back & forth between and it not affect the various challengers I’d say buy both."
481,Nancy Tirrell,5,the United States ,30-Nov-22,Love my new Fitbit,"I replaced my Alta with this new one. I love tracking my weight,calories burned & sleep. I have no way of knowing if the sleep monitor is accurate but it is interesting to look at.  I haven’t tracked my food & don’t plan to use the other things like mindfulness or stress. I don’t care about those. The only negative is that the bands are really hard to replace. I bought some extras but haven’t really used them much because they’re really difficult to pop in place. The Alta was much easier."
482,Dan Kennedy,5,the United States ,5-Dec-22,Vivid and Easily Readable!,"My old Fitbit Charge 3 tracker kept dimming over time (regardless of charging), until it finally became unreadable outdoors. I took a chance on the Inspire 3, and it has not disappointed. It doesn't seem to track stairs like the Charge 3 did, but that's a tradeoff with which I can live. It's pretty slim, so it feels a little less durable, but no problems for the first two months."
483,Mary-Jean Owens,5,the United States ,28-Nov-22,Details in a snap,"Changing trackers from Alta HR to Inspire 3 was much easier than I anticipated. I love the color display, it's bright and visible in the sun, and I really like the easy swiping for changing from settings to sleep to starting walks to working out at the gym to checking heart rate. Small learning curve, then just playing with it answers most questions. It turns on with wrist motion (optional setting)  and I really like that feature. So far, enjoying Inspire 3 and it is doing what I want and need from a tracker."
484,Kristy,5,the United States ,30-Nov-22,Works well,"I had an older Fitbit years ago. Liked it but stopped wearing it. My husband took that one and it still works great. So, I got to get a new one. Comfortable band. Light weight. Screen is a bit small for my eyes, but most people could probably read it without a problem. Syncs well with my cellphone."
485,Gigi Spence,5,the United States ,3-Dec-22,Inspire 3 is easier to read!,This is my second fit bit. I really prefer the Inspire 3 for the small size and the extra features. My Inspire 3 is easier to read and is more user friendly than the previous model. I use mine mainly to track steps but have enjoyed the text alert option as well. I’m very pleased with my purchase!
486,Amazon Customer,5,the United States ,2-Dec-22,Motivation,"Like tracking steps, miles per day. Surprising how quickly the motivation kicks in. Older model I had a decade ago kept track of “stairs climbed” (ie, walked from tip to toe of Italy, climbed my Everest). Curios that Inspire does not or I haven’t yet discovered that application"
487,Vinetta Blow,5,the United States ,7-Dec-22,It works,I have lost almost 10 pounds since I started using my fitbit. I have more energy and I am eating so much better. Fitbit makes it easy to stay focused on eating right and exercising and sleeping well.
488,Rich Thornton,5,the United States ,29-Nov-22,Great upgrade for me,I'm so glad to be able to read the time and steps in daylight. I had been using Inspire which could not do that. It would be nice if there was a way to have the number of steps bigger on it but I know there is limited room.
489,Lori M. Ortiz,1,the United States ,17-Sep-22,Horrible tracker,"I purchased this tracker because i liked the more feminine look of it and thought the apple watch was too clunky. I used it for 2 months and it's a horrible tracker with zero upside (other than looks).First, everything is touch screen with the sensor on the lower front of the screen. However, the sensitivity of the screen is awful. Sometimes i would have to press the area 7 or 8 times just to get it to move to the appropriate screen. it never worked smoothly and then it's hard to move forward and backward from the screens because the touch sensor is so wonky.Second, the measuring of distance is way, way, way off. I walk to work every day, and i know that my walk is exactly .75 miles. When i would use the tracker on this watch, it would be ridiculously off--usually way over-estimating the distance. I never had a day where it recorded less than 1 mile for this walk, and sometimes it would say as high as 2.5 miles! I have no idea what it was measuring, since it is supposedly connected through GPS on my iphone (which of course correctly measured .75 miles). it wasn't just wildly off on short city walks either. When i would use it for a walk on park trails the accuracy wasn't any better. Multiple times i went on a 2 hour hike and it would show that i logged over 15 miles! At most i was doing 6-7.Third, the battery life is horrible, especially if you use it to track a workout. I routinely go on 30-35 mile bike rides that take me about 3 to 3.5 hours. I used this tracker on 4 occasions to record my workout. Each time the watch was fully charged or almost fully charged (ie: over 85%). On three of the four workouts, the watch died before i could complete the 30-35 mile ride, so of course, it didn't complete the tracking.I went out and bought an apple watch (for not much more than this), and it is 400% better than this useless tracker."
490,Mary Thao,1,the United States ,10-Aug-22,Not Compatible With Garmin Connect IQ!,"Spent a whole morning disconnecting, reconnecting, unpairing, repairing, restarting — tried EVERYTHING because while the Lily was connected with the Garmin Connect app, I couldn’t figure out for the life of me why it was not connecting (let alone even showing up as a connectable device) with the Garmin Connect IQ app. I finally got in contact with a Garmin rep and went back and forth through some troubleshooting (most of which I’d already tried on my own) only to finally be told at the end that the Lily “was not compatible with the Connect IQ app, and that they were sorry and can understand that the marketing for the Lily was very misleading.” I said okay, took off the watch, put it back in its packaging, and returned it the very same day. Very, very, disappointed. The Connect IQ app was important for me because of a medical condition I have that can be better managed through an app which I use every single day on my phone and smartwatch (Apple for both). Not having access to this app on a smartwatch was an absolute deal breaker, I didn’t even have to think twice about this. I really loved the look and feel of the Garmin Lily watch and was so excited. Nevertheless, I guess I am sticking with my Apple Watch!"
491,Online Consumer,1,the United States ,9-Aug-21,Stops working--DON'T BUY,"Don't buy it! I bought my Lily the last week of March but soon it wasn't working during an activity. It just went blank and didn't record anything. I had to put it on the charger to get it back (and no, the battery wasn't the issue). I talked with Garmin Support and after sending them the watch, they immediately sent me a new one. Within a few weeks the second Lily stopped responding during an activity, wouldn't record and the only way to get the screen back is to put it on the charger. So, called Customer Service for Garmin again. This time I was the ""wow, you've won the lottery; no one has had two Lily problems like this. Only a handful of people have had the problem. Can you send this on back to the engineer department and we'll send you a new one?"" Sure, but this was BS because at this point, I'd read the Garmin Forum and found out that this was a KNOWN issue. Now, the THIRD Lily... have had it for about a week. Already DEAD during an activity multiple times. Get it back by putting it on the charger. What good is this? I have now called Garmin support for the third time. We tried some type of reset. And, I went out for a walk ... dead screen. Next, I've been told that ""maybe"" letting the battery run all the way out and then recharge all the way back up ""might"" fix it. Engineering department can't seem to replicate the problem on their end to isolate the problem. So, now I'm WAY past being able to return the watch to Amazon, but I am willing to work with Garmin to help them figure this out (if it can be) because really what other option is there? In the meantime, DO NOT BUY IT until they get the software or hardware problem (since they don't know which) resolved."
492,Beck Knows the Ground,1,the United States ,21-Sep-21,"Don't buy this, pick another Garmin watch","I'm not a smart watch wearer so I wanted something that would track my fitness but also look and function as a watch. I hate the squares and rectangles. I was very excited to get this in the mail and overall, the watch functions exactly as I wanted it to. It's waterproof, the app helps track and sync all of the data I wanted it to. HOWEVER there are 2 big reasons why I would not recommend you buy this.The first is battery life. The reviews I read said 5-8 days. From the start I needed to charge every 2 days. It might not be a big deal for some but I was expecting less and I'm confused as to why its run down that often when I hardly use it. It's not connected to my notifications and I don't play music on it.The second is the big one - the Lily's screen will freeze randomly and go blank for no reason. This is a known issue to Garmin (why the heck they're still selling them with a known issue is bonkers to me) and they say that right now, until there is a software update, the only way to fix it is to plug it into the charger. I take issue with this because I don't carry around the random charger with my everywhere and at the bare minimum, even if everything else is broken, I should be able to count on this to tell time. If it can't do that, why should I carry around this hunk of plastic on my wrist?If I could return it and exchange it for another less glitchy model I would. Shame on you Garmin for still selling these when you know they have as big an issue as this."
493,Kindle Customer,1,the United States ,1-Oct-21,Does NOT work! Glitchy. Garmin needs to recall this product,"The watch itself is so pretty! I have been a Fitbit user for 5+ years and just switched to Garmin for the looks of this watch. It looks like a real watch with all of the functionality of a smartwatch/activity tracker.The watch itself just doesn't work. It shuts off when you start activity connected to GPS or get in the sunlight. You cannot get it to become responsive again until you put it on the charger to reset it. So if you're out on a walk, bike, run, etc. and you're trying to track it - don't count on it. It'll shut off. It even shut off when I was outside gardening in the sun.This is a known issue with Garmin. They supposedly are working on a bug to fix it - I had the watch for 2 weeks and the bug was still not fixed so I decided to return it. Garmin really needs to recall all of these watches until they fix the issue.This is from their website support center: Garmin is aware of an issue where the screen on Lily can become unresponsive to touch making it appear either locked up or dead. If this occurs, you can recover the watch by plugging it in to charge. This will cause the watch to reboot recovering the screen functionality. This is only a temporary solution while we work on a permanent fix via a future software update. We will update this FAQ with additional information or when we believe the issue is fixed.The watch is so pretty, I really hope they can fix it soon and I'll give it another shot but seriously do not buy this."
494,SBGibbs,1,the United States ,4-Aug-21,DO NOT buy this product,"UPDATE: I emailed garmin support and they admitted there is an issue with this watch and wanted to send me another. I answered all her questions as she said it would help track down the issue(s). I asked if the issue was resolved. She said it was a temporary replacement until the issue was resolved. I said no thank you and the watch went back to Amazon.ORIGINAL POST: I have never been so disappointed in a garmin product. This is at least the third garmin watch I've had and it is horrible. Read other reviews on line before buying this product. I got the watch last Tuesday, left for a huge hiking trip on Friday and on the first hike Saturday the watch froze up and stopped tracking. I assumed it ran out of battery. Nope. I plugged it in and it had 84%. Bewildered I was. Off we go on Sunday. SAME THING. It has done this every day since I got it and I've missed out tracking four days of long hiking days. I'm so mad. During my trip I googled and it seems this is a very common problem and the way you can fix it (plug it in to the charge) isn't even reasonable. Who has their charger or a power source in the middle of a 12 mile hike???? It is going back to Amazon and I'm so mad I'm contemplating not getting another Garmin. I don't need a $300 fit watch. I need basics. But I also don't want a big bulky watch so the Lily was perfect if only it worked :("
495,Janeen Butcher,1,the United States ,11-Oct-22,Really wanted to love this!,"This was a hard watch for me to like. It's beautiful and it's small, it totally fit my wrist and looked great, but that's where it ended. It didn't sleep track well (I've had several Fitbit products) and wouldn't give me a REM or light sleep reading. It didn't have a great or even a good battery life...I had everything turned off and it only lasted a day. I wouldn't recommend this watch to anyone that is interested in fitness or sleep tracking. Do not get this watch!!"
496,Miguel,1,the United States ,17-May-22,Updates don't work and the watch suddenly stopped working,"It's a shame, the watch worked fine and I was happy, however suddenly it stopped working, garmin technical support says it's a bug in the last update, but it's been almost 2 months without working and without doing any update . The Amazon return time has expired and I am outside the United States, so it is a problem to have direct technical support. In my country, Ecuador, there is a company authorized to do technical support, but they tell me that in order to validate the guarantee I will have to pay an additional cost. It is not a $5 watch, so it is really annoying to have to go through this, the truth is that I expect much more from Garmin, it is not my first watch of this brand that I have, but this is turning out to be a waste of money."
497,Amazon Customer,1,the United States ,28-Nov-22,Got it yesterday and its almost dead already and refuses to charge longer than 5 seconds at a time,^put it in headline but im ordering a new one and seeing if its just a random error
498,josh02_2001,1,the United States ,24-Sep-21,"BEWARE Known issue with no current fix, Garmin selling anyway","I was really looking forward to this new Garmin watch, I have owned quite a few (45, 645, multiple kids watches for my children, etc). On the 3rd day of using the display shut off while running. There is no button so there was no way to reset. I was in the middle of a run and everything after that point was lost. I plugged it in and the display came back on, about an hour later it happened again.I called Garmin about the display issues and they let me know this is a known issue that currently there is no fix for and they are not sure how long it will be until there is. Why are they still selling a watch that they know is not working? Incredibly disappointing. The temporary fix is to plug it in but obviously that doesn't work while in the middle of an activity. Very disappointed in this customer service."
499,M Davis,2,the United States ,19-Nov-22,Delayed - not real time,"Although very beautiful, I've had problems with this watch from Day 1. It doesn't show steps or stats right away, sometimes it takes a while for it to catch up. The screen interface doesn't work well. I have to repeatedly tap the screen to get it to switch to the next screen or where I want it to go - very frustrating. I've had a Garmin watch before and didn't have these issues. I know there were a few other things that were irksome, but honestly, I stopped wearing it after a couple of weeks because it wasn't giving me what I was looking for in the easy way it should."
500,Shortcake ,2,the United States ,29-Aug-21,Meh,"After loving my previous Garmin activity tracker I was excited for a more stylish option. However, the Lily has been a letdown and not up to the Garmin quality I expect.My first Lily I sent back within a couple days of receiving it. The battery maybe lasted 1 day following a full charge. Or it would shut down. The only way I could turn it back on was by connecting to the charger (battery >50%). It inconsistently connected to my iPhone 11 via the Garmin app. So back it went and I hoped I just had a defective one.Lily #2 has been better with battery life lasting 3-4 days. It has only randomly shut down 1x in the 2 months I’ve had it. Still have connection issues with my phone. However, I can typically troubleshoot this by closing/re-opening the app or resetting the Bluetooth connection. If that doesn’t work then I plug it into the charger and that seems to reset everything. Nuisance and inconvenient.In summary, I’m disappointed. Fashion and function have not found each other in this device."
501,Micah M.,2,the United States ,21-Aug-21,Screen turns off randomly,"Pros of the Lily:Small and fashionable. I have been using the Garmin Forerunner 35 and it works great but is a bit chunky. I bought the lily because I loved how small it was in comparison and I have little wrists.Cons of the Lily:The screen will randomly decide to turn off, even if it has sufficient battery. It will be unresponsive to motion and tapping. The only thing that gets it to turn back on is to connect it to the charger which isn't helpful if you're gone all day. When it's turned off like this, it won't track steps or anything else.I ended up returning my Lily after a week because of the glitch with it turning off. I read a lot of forums to see that most others have this problem too, even if it's brand new. I love how small and stylish it is, I just wish Garmin would be able to fix the unresponsive issues that a lot of people apparently deal with."
502,Amy L. Donovan,2,the United States ,14-Aug-21,Looks great- but doesn’t function properly,"I’ll start by saying I love the look of this watch and how it’s designed. The bummer is that after having it for three months, it’s been nonstop connectivity issues. I’m constantly having to re-synch to my phone, my notifications stop coming through almost every day, and sometimes it won’t even pair with my phone at all. I wanted a watch that would track my workouts, count my steps, and send call/text notifications. The steps and workout tracking has always worked fine, but staying connected to my phone has never been smooth. After multiple phone calls with Garmin support and countless troubleshooting, they are finally willing to send me a replacement once I ship my watch to them. It’s super inconvenient and I wish they would just ship a replacement, but at least they’re willing to replace it. I’m really hoping the replacement functions the way it was designed to, bc it’s a cute watch (so many fitness watches a are bulky and ugly- not this one!). Here’s hoping for a fresh start."
503,Joe Paul,2,the United States ,12-May-22,Very disappointed,"My wife has had this for less than a year, and seems that there is always a new problem that arises. Many times, the watch cannot maintain a bluetooth connection. Now, it is hit or miss as to whether or not the watch even turns on. The claim of long battery life is a myth, it usually has to be charged twice a day under pretty minimal usage, no gps ever."
504,Amazon Customer,2,the United States ,7-Aug-21,Turns off at random!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH. it’s was a waste of money and time. it’s terrible that Garmin continues to knowingly sell a defective product!I wanted a smart watch I could wear to work and was looking for something different than the Apple Watch. this beautiful watch fit the bill but has a major glitch—the watch turns off randomly. You have to attach it to a charger to get it to turn on again. I worked with Garmin’s customer service and did a few software updates without success. They replaced my watch but had the same issue.  After another call to Garmin, they said that this is a known issue with the Lily Sports edition and that the Engineering  department is “working on It.”I should have checked their forums before buying it. Lots of other customers reported the same issue.Shame on Garmin! They should suspend sales until the issue is resolved!"
505,Marissa Alford,2,the United States ,13-Feb-22,Stopped Working,"First off, let me say that all the reviews I saw didn’t deter me from buying it and trying it out. I wanted to see for myself. I could see beyond the screen malfunctions. The sleep tracker is ok, except it records you when you’re lying down and not even sleeping. The battery didn’t even last 3 days using the sleep tracker. After I charged it this morning, the heart rate monitor stopped working, which is the whole reason for having a fitness watch. It became useless after 8 days. Very disappointed. I will be returning."
506,Rooasaurus,2,the United States ,15-Feb-22,Terrible Battery Life,"The description guide for this product is really deceiving. They advertise 5 day battery life, but that’s only if you don’t use any of the features the watch has to offer. I’ve worn it for a few days now and only got a day and half worth of use max.I liked the idea of this watch because it looked more stylish than most other smart watches, but this experience has me wondering if I should just rip off the bandaid and buy the Apple Watch instead…"
507,Kamille,2,the United States ,28-Dec-21,Not bad but wouldn’t but it again for iPhone,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Maybe it would be better with an android vs iPhone but I’m constantly having to reconnect it. Once the battery is to 40 it starts to get weird and wants to start activities for no reason. The water resistance…… so can you use it in the shower even fully emerge in the water, yes you can but… it goes into a weird mode where you cannot use it until you plug it in, as if it is dead. This doesn’t happen every time but just about. I don’t love it and honestly at this point I probably would have rather to spend a little more and get the Apple Watch."
508,joy thelen,2,the United States ,27-Jan-22,Beautiful but tracking is not great,"Pretty watch. Heart rate monitor is good but the sleep doesn't recognize when I move around in a seated position that I'm awake during hours I estimated when I'd go to sleep, but it has an edit button so I do use it often. The twist of wrist to activate the view screen isn't sensitive enough to recognize arm twist; you'll need to push the screen, the gps is really good. Overall it's a fine watch."
509,Amazon Customer,3,the United States ,11-Oct-22,Its cute,"I think this watch is super cute. I've had it for many months now. The good is that its cute, it tracks mostly well, lots of features, and the app is great. The problems are that the screen sensitivity is inconsistent. Sometimes its hard to get it to light up, then sometimes it's super sensitive when I'm showering or it swipes against something and presses things. It also does have some issues with accurate readings, like sleep for example. But it mostly reads well. If you are active, the battery life is very poor on it. Doesn't last more than two days if thats the case. I will keep using until it doesn't work but I wouldn't necessarily go buy it again."
510,dbpavlik28,3,the United States ,19-Jan-22,Nice looking smart watch - some bugs though,"I love the way this watch looks, very compact and 'feminine', not those gargantuan 20 lb things that other companies want you to somehow wear with 'ease'. The screen is quite durable and the strap is extremely comfortable.  I like the ability to change the watch faces to be more fashionable.  Now, for some of the challenges: It loses battery power quite quickly - it only lasts ~36 hours on a charge. It had a bug where it would just DIE mid-activity, that drove me out of my mind.  That's been better.  However, if you have bluetooth headphones that you use while exercising and communicating from the watch to your phone as well (2 bluetooths to your phone at once), it makes the watch freak out.  It will stop measuring steps and/or shut down completely.  That's extremely irritating as I listen to music or podcasts on my phone while exercising.  Also, the emergency alert gets activated at random times - e.g. rubbing against my sleeve or pantleg.  This is also maddening as my family members now think I'm calling 'wolf' and if I really needed help, they wouldn't respond. Thankfully I didn't put 911 in there too!  Egad.  I have only used a Garmin vivofit prior to the Garmin Lily, so the Lily is definitely an improvement, but not great."
511,Melissa,3,the United States ,11-Jul-22,Glitchy,"This watch is frustrating.  Its really nice looking and fits well on my small wrist.  The screen is a great size and easy to read.  It is soooooo glitchy.  I am regularly reconnecting it to power in order to reboot because it will count a small percentage of my steps.  Sometimes it will continuously start activities when I’m simply driving or working at my desk.  I had it replaced by garmin once because the body battery function was not working, it still functions poorly with that.  The sleep tracking works well.  Id say don't buy it.  Because replacing it will be tough, few look a nice as this watch."
512,loriv,3,the United States ,17-Jun-22,Great features but HR monitor is wildly inaccurate,"I was so happy with everything about the Lily until I worked out while wearing it. Firstly, it doesn’t have the project HR monitor feature so you can’t use it with workout equipment (like peloton, treadmill, etc). That wasn’t a deal breaker for me but it would have been nice to know. Where I had to draw the line was while working out, a very cardio heavy session and my heart rate was barely at 120. I also wore my stand alone HR monitor and I was clearly in the 150-160. It wasn’t even close. Had to return but am sad, I loved the look, size and all the features but the most basic function has to work!!"
513,ThriceMom,3,the United States ,7-May-22,"Ok, but perpetually disappointed","I bought this to track sleep and steps and to look nicer than a Fitbit. I’ve had it for three months and the step tracker is now unreliable. Sometimes it tracks steps, sometimes it doesn’t. I like all the info it provides me with when it’s working. For the $150 I paid, I feel like it should be more reliable. The other really frustrating thing is that the face doesn’t always turn on when I raise my arm, and sometimes not even when I tap it. I wish I could go back and buy something else. I was trying to avoid the price tag of the Apple Watch, but now I’m thinking it may be better to pay more for the reliability."
514,K × C,3,the United States ,23-Dec-21,"Doesn't respond to tap, text option missing ""yes""","It's super cute, I fell in love when I got it but... after 24 hours I decided to exhange it with Venu SQ. I needed a smaller smart watch, so Lily was perfect in size, was even able to wear it to sleep. But... the face doesn't come on sometimes and it won't even respond to the tap... and there is no button to simply wake the face. Also the preloaded text response doesn't have ""yes"" WHY? I simply need to be able to check the time, respond to texts quickly, and track some workouts... That's all I need and this watch can't offer me that. So I'm returning it. Sad but excited about the venu sq. Hope it will be good."
515,Amazon Customer,3,the United States ,27-Jun-22,GPS is not accurate,I am a long time user of the garmen watches. this is the most attractive yet the least accurate fir GPS activities.
516,Connie Gault,3,the United States ,27-Dec-21,OK - Not the greatest,"I have owned this watch for about a year.  It looks nice, but it doesn't track my movements very well.  After I have been up walking around for a while, working in the kitchen, etc., it gives me a notification to stand up and stretch.  It also gives me a buzz at 4am, which I cannot figure out how to cancel.  I have my notifications set not to notify me until 7am, but I get a little buzz at 4am and again at 6am.  I think I need to go back to Fit Bit."
517,Kris C.,3,the United States ,27-Jan-22,Lovely watch but low battery life,Absolutely love the look of this watch.  I have large wrist and wish the band was a tad longer but I made it work.  The battery life is low.  I have to charge it every other day.  I have to admit I don't use it much but for the actual time.  Couldn't figure out the purpose of the watch answering the phone but not being able to talk on it.
518,Marissa,3,the United States ,14-Mar-22,It's okay.,Didn't realize it wasn't a color screen ☹️. It's like a glorified fit bit charge that's obviously much prettier. I returned it and ordered a Galaxy watch instead. This is not worth the price in my opinion... But it does look very nice on.
519,KPH,4,the United States ,7-Nov-22,Love the style and size,I like the face- it is large that I can read but not too large that it over powers my wrist. I am used to fitbits and this is my first Garmin. I like the features but do not like how the app is set up on the phone. I find it complicated. The charge is pretty good and it picks up my text messages
520,G,4,the United States ,22-Aug-21,Updates are much better,"Updated-  things with my Lily have really improved since my initial review.  The bugs I noticed initially seem to have resolved with software updates.  It occasionally still sleeps as noted in #1 below it’s very rare. The stress tracking is incredibly accurate (I was a doubter of that feature but it’s spot on and reflects my entire day schedule when I’m stressed at different levels.)I’d offer a key suggestion to Garmin that this watch for women should track irregular menstrual cycles.  Surprisingly it does not. The software always defaults to a regimented cycle based on strict number of days.  This doesn’t work for women especially as they age.——-/——-initial review ———/——I really really wanted to love my Lily. Finally, Garmin finally created a watch made by women to fit women.  I wanted some thing that I could wear to work and workouts etc.  But after 2 weeks I’m very disappointed. Garmin launched this to tap the female market but they didn’t actually commit to quality or support for it.I have done everything to do the set up. Installed Garmin connect on my iPhone and Garmin express on my laptop which they recommend on the Garmin forums website.Here are the issues I am so frustrated with…1) It blacks out constantly and won’t wake back up AT ALL. The only offered tech resolution to this is to tell you to plug the watch back in to an outlet and then connect in sync with your Garmin connect app. But this happened MANY times a day.  Are we supposed to carry around the cord and plug it in all over town?  Women are busy. This thing should work.  This issue is repeated all over their tech support forums so I know I’m not alone.2) The battery lasts 1.25 days at best. Garmin models for men aka “unisex” last a 4-7 days.  Why?2) Garmin software and support do not truly supports Lily well.  Their female design team did a good job and the. no one else at Garmin followed through.  Lily is not even listed on the Connect App front page. It’s not listed AT ALL on the Express software for laptop.Garmin needs to get with it. Offer a firmware and software updates  that will come fix these issues.This is not the Garmin Company Quality we expected.Women look elsewhere."
521,Andrea,4,the United States ,14-Jan-22,Good at what it does,"I ordered this watch for a few reasons: 1) it's small enough that it doesn't over power my tiny wrists. 2) I liked the look of a real watch 3) It tracked a lot of data in a user friendly way while keeping the interface simple.It does all of these things. I have the display set to sensitive and bright but I shower every day and just charge it while showering and it doesn't run down the battery so I can't speak to how long it lasts without an every day charge.The one thing I'm not a fan of is that it randomly sends distress signals to my emergency contact. I've read other reviews that say this watch is prone to that, I don't know why it happens and it is kind of annoying. But I just follow up the distress signal with a text to my emergency contact and tell him everything is fine and move on with my day. So I will live with it.It's also somewhat inaccurate, I think. I can wave my wrist around and it will count that as a step. It also counts my ""route"" when I'm walking on the treadmill and I'm not sure why I thinks I turned around and made a circle when I literally only went in the one direction the entire time. So that's a little questionable. But I'm interested in that data in a generic way so that's fine with me.I'm more interested in sleep data which is what this thing does fairly well. I think it isn't counting how many times I wake up because I wake up to roll over several times a night but overall it works well to tell me how much deep sleep I get as well as my oxygen and heart rate so I can track patterns since sleep disorders have been an issue for me in the past.Overall it's a good watch and I like it."
522,emily,4,the United States ,13-Sep-22,Good,"I like to think of this as a stupid smart watch. It does everything I got it for - monitoring sleep cycles, telling time, and tracking basic vitals. However, it's battery life is somewhat short and the GPS is a bit wonky."
523,S. Mancini,4,the United States ,18-Jun-22,Wonderful Except Battery Life,"I love all the features and keep discovering more. It connects to my other apps (work wellness program) which is great. Two things that aren’t great: battery life and instruction manual. I have to charge at least every 36 hours or so. Wish it could last at least 72. The instruction manual leaves a lot of the features out and even the online version isn’t that helpful. I found answers to my questions on other sites, but ultimately this isn’t a huge deal. The main things people want to know are there. I love the look of it and am overall very happy with the purchase."
524,jonesy,4,the United States ,4-Feb-22,Could use some more accessories,"I love my lily watch. I am a 30 year old woman trying to get back into a better fitness program. I live in the Midwest and winter is difficult to get out and run so I do like to use the treadmill. There really isn't a way to track that with this watch though as it maps runs and when you are basically running in place, there is no way that I've found to track so far. Also, I had a magnetic back on my last watch to charge it which made it easy to find charging stations that could hold my phone, watch and headphones. This charges with a clamp on its side so I do wish there was more option for accessories but have been very happy with tracking sleep, fitness, calorie intake, and my womanly cycle. I wear it for about 3 days straight without charging so that I can get all fitness and sleep tracking and the battery is amazing."
525,Goldilox,4,the United States ,16-Jun-22,"It's a good watch, if you want more don't get it","This is as basic as you can get with a smart watch and it works for me. The selling point was the smaller face since I have small hands and wrists. I wear it daily and have had no issues thus far.I think the app could use some more work in terms of user friendliness, I've had this 8 months and I still have issues finding the alarm feature when I need to add or deactivate it.Otherwise I have no major complaints."
526,Aaron B. ,4,the United States ,22-Jul-22,Really nice watch.,The watch is comfortable and very sturdy. I feel that the steps are a little inaccurate but not too far off. There aren't very many quality band options for this watch. Customization isn't the greatest on this watch ether.
527,AbbieZ,4,the United States ,10-Apr-22,Missing a few features I like on my Garmin Running watch,"I love the size and comfort. It fits my small wrist well and is completely comfortable to run, sleep, and wear under coat sleeves. It is missing a few features that I was used to on my Garmin forerunner. Missing: heart rate doesn't display while running. I can't find a treadmill activity (maybe I can add this at setup not sure). The screen Doesn't stay on long enough for me to take vital signs ( I need 30+ seconds to count my patients' heart rates) it only stays on for like 3 seconds at the longest.  Doesn't have multisport.Features that I do like that it has:-Pool swimming with lap and stroke tracking.-Stop watch and timers."
528,Teresa J Blake,4,the United States ,22-Jul-22,Garmin Lilly,"This watch is stylish and feminine...the battery needs to be charged a little more than I like. Overall,  it is a great watch."
529,kittt,5,the United States ,23-Nov-22,Perfect for me!,"I love this smartwatch so much! I’ve been looking for a fitness tracker/smartwatch for awhile now but could not find anything that wasn’t huge or ugly or feminine looking. This Lily is pretty with its rise good accents and doesn’t overwhelm my wrist. Even better, it’s not overloaded with a ton of features I don’t need. It’s easy to operate & charge (it doesn’t need charged daily but I usually pop the charger on while I’m in the shower). I’ve found the steps to be accurate and it really has motivated me on those days I’m not quite meeting my goal to move a little bit more.  Surprisingly the sleep app is pretty accurate too. Sometimes if I’m awake laying still and trying to fall back asleep it does track it as light sleep, but it seems to have the times I sleep down to the minute. The REM and deep sleep accuracy lines up with what I recall from when I was dreaming or knocked out.  I love that I can read my text messages on it without having to whip out my bulky phone constantly.  I can’t say enough good things about the Lily except I wish I knew about it sooner!"
530,Chelsea,5,the United States ,4-Nov-22,"Great Alternative To Samsung, Apple, and FitBit","Garmin has made a terrific smartwatch in the Lily. The battery lasts for two full days on one charge. The charger is well thought out and holds the watch firmly in place so that it won't slip off. The Connect app updates frequently & refreshes even when viewing stats to keep an accurate & current count in real time. It is easy to navigate through the widgets on the watch face. The watch is very responsive and no glitches to speak of. I love that it tracks your stress, blood oxygen, and sleep patterns. The connection to my phone is seamless, and the notifications through it are not obnoxious like watches I've had previously. I find the widgets useful & insightful. Its not packed full of useless apps that you'll never use unlike others on the market. The price point is very reasonable for what you're getting. The Lily is pleasing to the eye, comfortable, responsive, and packed full of all the things you could need in a smartwatch, and non of the stuff you don't. If you're looking for a smartwatch that doesn't break the bank and still does everything, this is it."
531,PMK,5,the United States ,31-Oct-22,Love My Garmin Lily - Feminine and Functional,"Full disclosure - I'm a total Garmin girl. I have the Vivofit for years but wanted to upgrade. I was looking for something that was functional but didn't look like everyone else's and not a cut down dude's watch. I was considering a Google Pixel watch but wasn't sure I wanted to be an early adopter. Enter the Garmin Lily! Wow! I love this watch! First the look is feminine but not girly. I got compliments the first day I wore it. It sets up easily and does all I need it to do with minimal interruption of my day. It doesn't beep or play music - fine with me! It vibrates strongly enough to get my attention but not annoyingly. I don't use it with a ton of apps and probably not using it to it's full capability but I don't care! It's fantastic and I'm so happy to have a truly functional and feminine watch. Home Run, Garmin!!"
532,Kindle Customer,5,the United States ,3-Dec-22,Helps keep me on my fitness goals,"I love this watch. It’s user friendly and much better than Fitbit. I have a very small wrist so this size is perfect for me. Tracks my sleep patterns, my heart rate, my exercises and greets me every morning with a cheerful message. It’s really made a big improvement in my exercise habits. Well worth it!"
533,Peyton C.,5,the United States ,14-Oct-22,Love it!,"I'm a huge fan of Garmin and their products. I have the Forerunner 245 Music, and it's one of the best purchases I've ever made. I decided to get the Lily in order to have something a little less sporty to wear when I'm not running. It's beautiful, delicate, and classic. I have small wrists, and I love the look of this watch. It doesn't look like a smart watch. The touchscreen is responsive, as is the ""lift to wake"" feature. The battery life is good, too. It lasts for a few days before needing to be recharged. It's obviously not going to be able to perform the way that Garmin's other watches can as it is less expensive and doesn't have the features the other watches do, so keep that in mind. I think this is a great watch for someone wanting to have something nicer to wear when they aren't working out."
534,rachelbuysonamazon,5,the United States ,21-Nov-22,Great product but weird issue with connect app,"Happy with this purchase overall. Just have a weird issue that even support can't resolve where my husband cannot be added as an emergency contact.Otherwise I love how it looks, easy to configure and tracks and notifies me on my phone activities.Don't super use the sleep tracking. Use it mostly for notifs and activity tracking."
535,Debbie McClain,5,the United States ,4-Nov-22,I Love this!,"If you are considering this one.....buy it.  You will not be disappointed.  It is the perfect size and fits comfortably. The battery life last about 3 or 4 days, depending on all that you have turned on.  I wasn't sure if I'd like this color watch band, but I love it.  It goes with absolutely everything!"
536,Libraryghost,5,the United States ,27-Feb-22,It's a lovely pedometer -- the app needs an option to record daily BBT,"I originally bought this to count steps for insurance. It's been an accurate pedometer and counts my steps even when I'm carrying objects and doesn't appear to add steps when I am gesturing with my hands. However, it is terrible at estimating distance for me (I think because it doesn't have GPS independent of a phone).Appearance-wise, it's truly lovely and fits my petite wrists perfectly. I have the silicone band and it is incredibly comfortable to wear all day. I practice daily yoga, but other than occasional resistance training, no sporty stuff. The apps I use most are the step-counter, the water tracker and the fertility tracker. The biggest drawback for me is that the Garmin app's cycle tracker is extremely basic (it uses a calendar method), but if you track fertility with a sympto-thermal method, there is no way to enter basal body temperature other than adding it as a comment in the app, which was really disappointing to me. I was hoping this could be an alternative to Clue, but it isn't there yet.I read a lot of reviews about the screen not coming on with the raised wrist gesture, but I don't have it on the ""high sensitivity"" setting, and it still works great for me. A huge upside is the brightness adjusts and I have no problem seeing the screen indoors or out. Also, the battery life has been good for me (I charge it every 4-5 days, and it charges very fast), but that may be due to personal settings. The Garmin app has lots of interesting data, but the challenges seem particularly geared toward runners and cyclers. My daily activity is yoga, and I would love to see more yoga challenges. It's also a bit annoying while tracking a yoga activity that you have to tap the watch to signal a new pose when you're often supporting yourself or zenned out in a pose.I originally wanted the bronze one (based on appearances), but after trying one, the leather was stiffer and less comfortable than the silicone band, and I had concerns (from reading reviews) about the leather wearing out because I'm a busy girl and a delicate watch would show wear fast. I'm so glad I went with the sports edition because it's still beautiful, is more comfortable and does nearly everything I need it to do. I'm not sure it would be enough for a hard-core sports person (e.g. no GPS and can't send workouts to the watch like you can for other Garmin watches)."
537,Tana Couture,5,the United States ,20-Oct-22,1 Happy Customer!!!,I am instantly in love with my Lily that I just got today!!! She was so easy to setup and understand! The fist thing I noticed was the sturdy wristband and clasp. I have had two previous low grade fitness trackers that I lost due to fault wristbands. I'm super excited about all the wonderful adventures Lily and I will have together!!!!😊
538,Carleen,5,the United States ,25-Mar-21,Love this little smartwatch,"Lengthy review warning:I purchased the Lily a couple months ago, right when it first came out.  I originally had the Garmin 45S, and when the Lily came out I was excited to try it out since it has a pulse oximiter and looks so classy.  It was a seamless transition to add it to the app, and switch the Lily over to my 'default' device.  I wear it pretty much all the time.  I haven't had much of an issue with the GPS being connected through the phone- that's been fine.Pros:  looks amazing, comfortable, easy to use with the touch screen; I like the simple text replies built-in.  Loving the emergency alert and pulse oximeter, as I have medical issues and these features make me feel safe.  I like the hydration widget. The touch screen is excellent and intuitive.  The manual activity tracker (when you tell it to record at the start of an activity such as walking or yoga) seems pretty accurate on distance, etc.Cons: pulse oximeter takes probably 2 minutes of standing still and is picky - doesn't always read you.  The battery doesn't last very long - my 45S lasted around 3 days, and the Lily lasts about 24-36 hours for everyday use in my experience.  No onboard GPS, if you're needing that.  And there are minor issues when it aromatically starts to record an activity (when you tell it to record an activity manually, it's great).  For example, when you've been walking for 5-10 minutes, it tries to start an activity (walking) and incorrectly saves the distance.  For instance, I walked 2.5 miles and it recorded 1.  I walked half a mile and it recorded 125 ft.  if it doesn't attempt to record anything, it at least gets your steps right.  At least on my particular device, if you try to cancel the automatic activity recording, it buzzes repeatedly at you that it didn't save the activity, for a few hours every few minutes.  Seems like it might be a software glitch that will hopefully phase out in future updates.Overall impression (TL;DR): Awesome watch for price and size.  Great for everyday wear, and looks amazing.  Only a couple of minor issues."
539,Kereen Pinkstaff,1,the United States ,24-Dec-21,Don't believe the hype,"I thought it was pretty alright when I first received it on Nov. 26th 2021. Then I noticed the battery life was crap. I never had an accurate sleep reading because it was always needing to charge at night. And it was always on battery saving! I didn't use many apps as this was my first smart watch so, I just had the standard ones that it comes with.  Nothing fancy.The mobile app is eh at best.I had got the watch so I could start keeping track of my fitness or lack there of. With everything that goes with tracking. To start being healthier.I never felt it was accurate. No matter if I was active or not. The heart rate was all over. But, I chalked just about all that up to me being new to the smart watch deal. And I figured because it was a good brand and I also have a Samsung phone the kinks would work out. And I was OK with that it'd be good in time.Flash forward to last Thursday, I noticed the tear on the band by the clasp. (See photo) I contacted chat support to say I needed a new watch band. That's it! That's all I needed. All the other issues I was letting slide. I just wanted a replacement band. I haven't even had the watch a month. How hard could it be?Well pretty damn difficult because after hours on chat, text, and phone conversations nobody was able to say they'd send a replacement band out. NOBODY! I was told I wouldn't have to keep repeating the issue with other reps, I was told ""The Team"" was going to figure it out, I was told someone would call me (I made 3 calls and was called once) each time nobody could just order me a new band. I was put on endless holds. I explained to someone and talked to her a half hour then she said she couldn't help then I was put back into the que. I text proof of purchase and the tear to them on a different line because the attachment feature on chat doesn't work. I was sent two links to click on and those people there can help. They were both dead end links. I also had two ticket numbers that were given to me regarding getting a new band. One person said it was for the watch band and another person said it was for a charger? So it was canceled. Their answers were weirdly scripted as well.Well after a week and way too many hours I returned the watch all because they couldn't or didn't want to replace a watch band. I was going to iron out the other issues or whatever. I just needed a new watch band. If they can't get it together for that, what would have happen if I had a bigger concern. I don't buy expensive ass watches all the time or at all. But, I should be able to get a replacement band after less than a month of use.Pathetic"
540,Stefan Stoyanov,1,the United States ,21-Aug-22,Terrible fitness watch,"It's been disappointing from day one of getting this watch. As a galaxy phone user, I decided to upgrade from a 7 year old watch to this, thinking it can only be better. I was so wrong... Bugs that I've noticed so far:1. Always on display is dim, so when running outside in the sun you can't see anything. There's no way to make it brighter, you have to touch the watch/raise wrist to turn it back on, rendering AOD worthless2. GPS is slow and inaccurate. Example: running 100m sprints, according to the watch, my top speed was 10mph - yes, 10!!! This is my max out of 8 x 100m sprints. I run 10k at 10mph pace.3. There is no heart rate zone training in the app. Old watch has it4. Can't adjust your heart rate zones. My maximum heart rate is much higher than the watch has by default which makes all of my zones wrong. My old watch can be adjusted5. My old watch has a mode where you race vs your  previous run. Not GW46. It loses my heart rate all the time when using 'Other workout'One more thing, Samsung health app shows a graph of your workout with time on the X axis. However, you can't tell what exact minute and second the point on the graph refers to. It'd be great to be able to see that (needless to say, my 7 year old watch has that functionality).I was thinking about returning the watch from the beginning but was trying to find solutions to those issues. Now my 30 days are over and it seems these are the worst 150 bucks I've ever spent. Samsung just seem to be a decade behind true sports watch companies. I'll try to get rid of this and get a Pilar/Fitbit/etc., I know those work as they are supposed to. I do NOT recommend this watch"
541,Clarke Hall,1,the United States ,9-Jan-22,Most of the features do not work,"I bought this watch primarily to keep track of my heart rate without having to use my pulse oximeter. The watch consistently shows that my heart rate is ten beats higher than what my pulse oximeter says. My pulse oximeter works and is accurate and I've compared it to readings at my doctor's office and the hospital. I set up vibrating alerts for low and high heart rate. My heart can go to under 50bpm and as high as 160bpm. I set the alert for under 60bpm and higher than 110bpm. My heart has definitely reached the low end and high end of the spectrum and I haven't received any alerts.The oxygen saturation detection does not work. It is consistently 10-20 percentage points below what my pulse oximeter says.The fall detection does not work whatsoever. I have fallen several times while wearing my watch even after I toggled the option to be more sensitive to falls. It did alert me of a ""fall"" when I was slapping my leg to get my dog to come to me, but when I've fallen really hard, the fall alert has not come up.I am a small person, meaning my wrists are also small. They measure 5.25"" around. The small watch band is too big even on the smallest setting. Also, because of the way the band folds under the watch, it makes the watch not sit completely flat. One side is slightly raised. I can easily fit two fingers under the band.The sleep tracker is not accurate. It has said I'm awake when I am most definitely asleep and vice versa.The pedometer feature does not work. It counts steps when I'm literally doing yoga on the ground.Overall, this watch was a complete waste of money. I would advise anyone to get an iPhone and then get an Apple watch. Samsung missed the mark entirely."
542,MK,1,the United States ,29-Nov-22,40mm vs 44mm,"Just returned this 40mm watch because the battery life is AWFUL.  I have a Galaxy 2 and this was a downgrade.  What I didn't realize, is that my Galaxy 2 was a 44mm size which also means it has bigger battery than the 40mm. If you don't mind the watch only holding a charge for a day, get the 40, but if you want a 2-3 day charge, get the 44mm.  I returned this and bought a 44.  Otherwise, all the features are pretty standard with my old Samsung with a few little upgrades"
543,gary,1,the United States ,30-Nov-22,Stop working,"Had this watch for a year. Although I experience some of the issues the other 1 star reviews describe. I decide it to stick to it as I'm a Samsung user, but just 1 day ago it just staring acting up it would just go randomly to other apps just all.over the place I try to reset to.my surprised it reset to a different language and not responding to any commands,  I guess suddenly it became possess. Lol. Unfortunately I can't recommend this item"
544,Amazon Customer,1,the United States ,31-Aug-22,Crap,"I had this for a month before it stopped working. The top right button was non responsive. I spoke with Samsung care and they said to ship it to their repair center. I do, and am told I owe $175 for an out of warranty issue... for something I had a month! They said there was water inside... for a WATERPROOF device. Not resistant, but PROOF... It has swimming modes to SPECIFICALLY have it whilst swimming! I spoke with Arnelli (or something like that) and she was arguing with me on what waterproof means. She said ""oh, that means it can get rained on, but you gotta put it away"". Ummm. NO! I told them not to fix it and to just return it to me. The new galaxy 5 just came out with a trade-in for any condition fpr just about as much as the repair would be. Its insane how they pulled that!"
545,Amazon Customer,1,the United States ,16-Jul-22,Nope.,"Battery didn't even last close to 24 hours, with AOD off, location off, stress sensor off.  It doesn't matter how snappy it performs, how many features it has if the battery is dead!  Or if you have to disable most of them to get decent battery life.  I even tried unloading some of the preloaded apps I would never use.  Another thing that wouldn't have been a deal breaker, but I was disappointed by, was that I could not control my Nest thermostat with the watch directly.  The SmartThings app made you open your phone.  I could do it using Google Assistant, but if I wanted to without talking there was no easy way to do it on the watch itself.I read the reviews of people saying the battery was bad, but others said it was ok... Samsung claims 40 hours or something like that.  That would have been livable. Even 30 I could live with.  Less than 24 is not.  Sadly, returning."
546,Kim,1,the United States ,21-Nov-22,Had to return.,Couldn't get it to stop draining the battery on my watch & my cellphone. From full charge both were dead within 6 hours. Customer Service was no help at all. They wanted me turn every single feature off. I told them what's the point in having the watch if I can't use the features that come with it!BTW...I didn't have this problem with my Samsung Gear Fit2 Pro.
547,Kristina D Tass,1,the United States ,25-Jul-22,Water resistant my...,"I bought this watch back in Feb 2022, it's now July 2022 and it's dead. It claims to be water resistant, but nowhere in the quick start guide or manual did I see that a toggle must be turned on to make the watch water resistant. I wore the watch for less than 5 minutes in and out of the rain, and all of the sudden it wouldn't turn on. I send it in to Samsung to repair, and they tell me bc it has water damage, it's not covered under the warranty, and it will be $176.50 to repair. After 3 days of trying to get them to understand that it should be covered as the watch is water resistant, I have made no further progress. I'm told repeatedly that my only options are to pay the fee or they'll return the broken watch. Utter ridiculousness. I'll NEVER buy another Samsung watch."
548,Anthony,1,the United States ,3-Dec-22,DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE AN IPHONE!,"I looked up before I ordered it if it can connect to and iPhone and it said yes, so I ordered it. When I received it, it would not connect so I looked up a video and it said that this watch is the only Samsung watch that cannot connect to iPhone."
549,Sara T,2,the United States ,4-Nov-22,Tried SOOOO hard to love it,"I wanted to love this. I love that it worked so well with my Samsung phone. Love the body composition option and all the cool things I could do with it. I think it counted steps and did my heart rate just fine. I liked being able to reply to texts and answer the phone from my watch and the sleep data was great. BUT....the total calories burned data is what messed it up for me. Like one day I walked 9000 steps, 2 floors and burned 2141 calories. The next day I walked over 16000 steps  6 floors and only burned 2060 calories. The only difference is that I actually logged an actual walk on the former day. My friend, who did everything I did on the 16000 step day, had about the same amount of steps and floors, but her fitbit said she burned 2500 calories for the day.  I know fitbit takes into account your heart rate and how many calories that burns....samsung doesn’t do that.....Your heart rate doesn't account for any of the exercises or steps. Maybe the fitbit I had before just spoiled me...or maybe it gives too many calories burned. I don't know, but something has got to give. I count my calories eaten, so the total calories burned is important to me so I can make sure I eat less than I burn. I'm going back to fitbit"
550,Tony,2,the United States ,5-Sep-22,Worst customer service and warranty.,"Watched was a great product until it stopped working. Set it on the charger for about thirty minutes after it died. When I went to turn it back on the screen wouldn't come on, but I could tell it was on because it was vibrating for phone calls and messages. The backside looked like the battery leaked acid out.Being only 8 months old Samsung told me it was still under warranty and sent me to a repair shop about 40 minutes away, who told me that they cannot repair watches, which Samsung knows but sends people to anyways, and I'd have to send it to Samsung.The day Samsung received the watch they sent me a bill for $176 saying it was out of warranty. I called and they said it had liquid damage (if you google,many people have been told the same thing when it breaks) and was no longer powering on. The watch has never been in the shower or pool, only in rain which it is supposedly water resistant up to 200' of water. It also powered on before sending it to them.I argued with them and Mikayla in the repair department said they would have a second person look into it and call back in 48 hours. 4 days later I recieved an email saying the watch was being returned unfixed and I never received a call back so I called and was told it was set for exchange. Talked to someone in the case management department and they said the price was going to be refunded. I asked how long and they said once the paperwork it accepted, then asked me to confirm my contact so they could START the paperwork. They never contacted me to start the paperwork, so I'm sure they were hoping I wouldn't call back and are still trying to stall. They told me to call back if I hadn't heard anything by Thursday, so I will be calling then."
551,Brian Lippman,2,the United States ,4-Dec-22,"Poor Samsung experience, as usual","Once again Samsung provides a terrible experience. While there's the usual things like Samsung apps you can't disable or get rid of, it has an absolutely terrible user experience. Several times, after rebooting my phone (Pixel 7) the watch failed to reconnect and would have to be reset as if I was connecting to a new phone (that it has to reset to connect to a new phone instead of checking if you're signed into a Samsung account on a new device and just connecting is terrible on its own). Then when I would go to restore my old settings from the cloud backup, it would say the restore was successful but nothing would change on the watch. So what's the point of this function if it doesn't actually restore anything? Poor experience and once again proves that Samsung isn't worth the effort."
552,Samantha McPherson,2,the United States ,29-Nov-22,Don't change your phone number,"I can't use the app because my phone number changed. Samsung requires that I verify that it's me, but the only way to do so is to receive a code to my phone, at the old number. I contacted customer service about it and was told there was nothing they could do, I'd have to create a new email address and make a new account. The login/create account page would not allow me to create a new account either without proving its me so they had to send me a link and told me to make a new email address just to create the account. Then the system would not send me the email confirmation link. So I am returning the watch and getting a Fitbit Versa instead."
553,Cyndie C.,2,the United States ,29-Sep-22,Poor range with phone,"First of all, let me just say I'm comparing this watch to an Apple Watch.  Not really much comparison, Apple has it hands down.  I recently switched to a Samsung Phone.  I like the phone, but strongly dislike the watch.  The range to the phone has to be so close, why even bother . . . This morning I was on the elliptical machine for a little over a mile (30 minutes) and I just noticed a little while ago my watch said 531 steps.  How can that be??? My apple watch gave me credit for a workout and it counted towards my steps.  This watch isn't as user friendly as the Apple watch either.  Oh, and I didn't rate the sleep tracking because I've never used it, so can't say if it's good or bad for that.  For those who are looking for something comparable to the Apple Watch, this watch isn't for you.  For those who have never had an Apple watch, maybe this will work for you, not sure."
554,WML,2,the United States ,18-Jul-22,Uncomfortable. Didn't hold a charge.,"I was quite excited to upgrade to a fancier version of my Galaxy Fit. And at first everything seemed great. I did buy more comfortable bands from Etsy, but even that didn't help much. And I thought the battery life would be okay, but compared to the Fit, it was awful. And if it's going to track sleep, why would I want to charge it every night? I will say that it seemed to charge very fast.It didn't seem to track my walking very well, at least automatically. It would start very late. I didn't care because I use an app on my phone for that.I didn't learn much about the functionality, since I did return it. I decided to return it the day I had it charged it to 100%, then it did an update, and when I went to check the weather the phone was off. I tried to turn it on and discovered it was dead. Since it uses a proprietary charger and I was at work, I had to just wear a dead watch all day.I could probably deal with the comfort by finding the right band, but the battery life is too terrible for something this expensive."
555,Matt,2,the United States ,29-Nov-22,A pain to use with non Sansung Phone,"Your experience might be different if you have a Galaxy phone, but with any other Android some important features are unusable. This could have been a 5 star product is Samsung decided to develop for compatibility with all Android devices. Here's a list of features that only with with a Samsung phone: ECG, Blood pressure monitoring, Samsung Messages, Camera controls, Do not disturb mode syncing, Bedtime mode, Make/receive calls when not connected to a phone via Bluetooth, Customizable AR Emoji watch faces."
556,Jackie,2,the United States ,8-Mar-22,If I knew then what I know now...,"This watch is pretty.  It's cool.  It'll satisfy that part of you that likes gadgets.  It's also NOT worth the money.  I waited 2 months to write this review, because I didn't want to jump the gun and give my initial impressions.  So, let me say that I've already had to send in the watch to Samsung at the 31 day mark (well played Amazon, who said it was outside the 30 day window) because it would get the ""Samsung locked by Knox"" error and freeze.  Samsung customer service was very nice, was very concerned about my issues, and did nothing other than update the software and send it right back.  I've had it an additional 30 days, and let's just say that I've lowered my expectations for this watch, or I'd just chuck it off the nearest overpass.Others have said that the battery life is terrible - it is.  I can't use the sleep features because the battery is dead before I get to sleep.  I can't use the Heart Rate Monitor, because it gets stuck at 117 bpm even while I'm binging Chicago PD - so there goes the health portions of the watch.  So basically, if you want to pay over $200 for a step monitor, ability to read your text messages, and well, to see the actual time, this is the watch for you.  If you want anything else - save your money."
557,jokane,2,the United States ,29-Oct-22,Terrible Battery Life,"I have to charge daily.  Tracking a workout and a walk or run in the same day? Try again.  Battery wont last.  I've removed texts,  calls,  apps to assist with battery life.  Even reduced brightness... nothing helps.  I replaced my fitbit watch with this and have regrets.I do feel the activity tracker is more accurate than the fitbit, but overall I would not purchase again.  Most likely going to sell and invest in the Garmin or Google watch."
558,lashaunta wearrien,2,the United States ,20-Oct-22,Over priced wrist watch,"Yes it tracks my exercise, sleep, and ekg BUT...I never get to track my sleep because the battery is dead by the end of the day. It takes approx 2hrs to charge and if you used apps then it only lasts about 12-13 hrs per charge. This a far cry from my Active 2 which only needed to charge every 2-3 days. I am so disappointed."
559,mishqueen,3,the United States ,1-Dec-22,I'm probably not the ideal match for this watch,"First, ya'll need a place on your site with a more detailed tutorial of how to utlize each function. The short moving gif clips make it look so simple but then there's nowhere to go with your further questions for how to achieve the results you want.Second, I had four issues to consider when choosing a smartwatch. To pay this much money for a device, it needs to meet all 4 needs.1. I need an ECG. I use a little modular unit but I'd like to have one with me all the time.I cannot get the ECG on this watch to work at all yet, even once. I've tried it dozens of times in dozens of positions. No matter how still I sit, it tells me I was moving or that my result was unreadable.2. I need detailed sleep tracking. How long I'm in each cycle is important for my fatigue problem.But I can't tell if it's accurate or not. It has lots of data showing up in the morning, but there are sleep and wake patterns that don't jive with my memory of the night before.3. I need unlimited reminders, that are silent when I finally fall asleep. So far, they are very reliable even when I'm asleep (waking me up) or on another setting they don't buzz at all, just show up quietly on the watch.Either the reminders can't be subdued by sleep or DND, or I just need to learn how to use them correctly. So far I haven't found that info online. I get that my alarm still needs to go off, but my entire to do list doesn't need to start buzzing when I'm trying to sleep in.4. I have a child-sized wrist. Please make a watch small enough to fit on a wider range of people. Is petite people's money not good enough for ya? As it turns out, the 'small' band on its tightest notch is not holding the watch flat on my wrist when I rotate my forearms. It lifts up on one corner or the other. Not to mention it looks ridiculous and out of scale for small people. I have already begun the process of trying to switch bands out, but so far the aftermarket ones are longer, not shorter. Even the stretchy ones. But more are coming for me to test.If the watch functions turn out to be not working merely because it can't get tight enough, I will return the watch but change the review up to 4 because my wrist is not your fault. But if I get a successfully tight band but it turns out you just sold me some functions that don't actually work, I'll return it and lower the rating to 2.But I hope I just figure out how to get it to work for me, so I can give it a full 5 stars."
560,Rebecca J.,3,the United States ,2-Dec-22,"Fantastic watch for almost everything, worse battery EVER!!","I love this watch.  All the apps and options, all the faces you can use with the different designs and info you want on the face.  I like having the time, steps, weather and date on mine, but you can change it to so many other options whenever you wish.  This is the first smart watch that has connected efficiently to my Samsung phone without it being painful and I get all my calls, messages, calander events, absolutely everything on my phone.  I love the phone!  Here comes the BUT...and it's a big issue.!!!  The battery doesn't even last a day.  Maybe 20 hours, if you use the apps a bit.  What a pain.  I haven't decided what to do yet.  Because the other big plus for me is this is also one of the first smart watches, other than Fits bits, that doesn't use nickel or cheap metals in the watches that I react to and have to send back.  I'm highly allergic.  And Fits bit can never get their Smart Watches to connect to my phone and keep giving me the run around and telling me to call here and there.  But their batteries last FOREVER!  So inconvenient to charge a watch up throughout a busy day...any suggestions?  So sad about this, why can't they have a better battery on such a great watch???"
561,That guy,3,the United States ,18-Jul-22,OS change from Active2,"UPDATE 10/17/2022: I've dropped the rating from 4 to 3 because of the OS issue.  Today, Android informed me that it needed to install an update.  Little did I realize that when I did so, it would completely reset the watch.  For a terror-filled half hour this evening, I seriously thought that the steaming offal pile that is Google was going to make me re-purchase the watch faces I'd downloaded when I originally set up the watch, as it was impossible going through the Play store to simply zero in on the apps I've downloaded.  I don't know when that changed either, but where it used to be easy to view my downloads, that feature is gone too.  I've been using Android products for >10 years, so I think I know my way around the Play store.  The sad thing is, I really want to like this watch.  There are a lot of good things about it.  The switch from Tizen to Android OS, though, is a serious problem.  I don't know if it's big enough yet to make me switch to the other major brand of phones and wearables, but I'm seriously considering it after this last debacle, especially since I'm up for a new phone with my carrier.  Google has the anti-Midas touch lately.  Very disappointing.Size-wise, this (40mm) watch is comparable to the Active2 that I needed to replace.  I didn't realize that the OS had changed, so instead of buying/downloading watch faces through Samsung like I have been, I'm now stuck getting them from Google.  Samsung had a far better selection, and there are way too many candidate faces that come up in the search that look good, only to get the, ""Sorry, this app is not compatible with your device!"" message.  Hopefully this will change soon, but so far, it's the biggest disappointment.Also, battery life through the first couple of days has been remarkably short.  Plan on charging it before you can wear it; mine came completely uncharged.  For the time-between-charging issue, I think I just need to find my settings and turn off what I don't need (WiFi etc.) to get longer life out of it.Also, it's impossible to tell from any of the pics online which size bands you'll need if you don't like the one Samsung includes.  From what I've been able to tell, all of the Galaxy Watch 4 models use a 20mm band.  I had to go to Best Buy to look at actual watches before pulling the trigger on the Prime Days sale for this watch.  Thankfully, all the ones I recently bought for the Active2 fit the GW4.On a positive, the screen resolution is improved vs. the Active2.Long story short, still getting used to the watch, but so far, I'm liking it.  There are enough things I don't like at the moment to keep me from saying that I love it, but I'll update this review over time to let you know how I've adapted to it.  This review is only after about 36h wearing it so far."
562,Adrienne,3,the United States ,16-Nov-22,Worst sleep tracker ever,"Battery life is terrible, I had a fit bit before that I only charged once per week, and even with limited options turned on I have to charge this watch every 36 hours, or less.The sleep tracking is horribly inaccurate! I loaded photos, it is constantly thinking I'm taking naps even though I'm clearly awake. Just sitting still. And it won't let you edit those times at all. It's either delete or deal. Fit bit was super accurate. And was able to be edited if it did track wrong.Also it does NOT track walking if you are pushing a stroller, so you get no credit for walking, and it stops tracking if you sent move your arm obnoxiously.  I know some people say put it on your ankle, but that defeats the purpose of a watch.Needs some serious work."
563,Marnie Carpenter,3,the United States ,9-Nov-22,No worth the money.,I had a Samsung 2 and it was not correctly reporting the sleep and would change faces all the time I debated whether getting it to fix or getting a new one and then when I looked at the new one I thought I'll just go ahead and get a new one. But unfortunately it's not any better than the old one It does not record all the sleep and it has a few times change the faces without me doing anything. And they know the flaws with the sleep so it shouldn't be sold until it is fixed. So until it is fixed I would not recommend Samsung 4.
564,Tabitha,3,the United States ,28-Sep-22,Disappointed,I had the previous galaxy watches/fit bit.. n everything worked as stated. The battery life sucked but still. So I felt like the galaxy 4 would be an upgrade. I was disappointed. The speaker to text doesn't work majority of the time. That's disappointing for me because it's how I communicate at work. The Bixby doesn't work either so I can't just tell it to call someone or text someone etc. The sleep tracker is ok but not very accurate. The mobile app have helpful tips but u can't do much on it. The battery life is GREATTT..  I work 12-13 hour shifts.. I have my Bluetooth connected the whole time because again it's how I communicate at work and when I get home I'm at 20-40%. I feel like that's a damn good battery life. I charge it before bed. I take it off the charger go to sleep.. wake up.. get ready for work and turn my Bluetooth on and leave it on and use it for 12-13 hrs and I still have 20-40% when I get home. Battery life is the best.. the rest wasn't worth the money.
565,Honest User,3,the United States ,18-Nov-22,Good looking but has serval bugs,"I use the watch with non-galaxy Android smart phone. The watch has good looking style. Overall, the functionalities are good. However, the most annoying bug is that whenever the phone went to airplane mode and turn off airplane mode, the watch won't reconnect. It will require user to reset (clear everything) the watch in order for it to reconnect to the phone. It might be a software bug but not sure if Samsung will cooperate with other phone company to fix this issue."
566,Christy Parrish,3,the United States ,29-Oct-22,Burning my wrist,"Bought the watch so I could keep track of my heart rate and steps.  The best rate works pretty good,  I have it on continuous but sometimes when I look at it out gives me the rate from x minutes ago.  Steps matches pretty good.  Sleeping- the watch tells you your sleeping if you are relaxing on the couch, laying in bed watching TV.  My heart rate are wonky so that may be part of the reason it doesn't ready right.  My big issue is the watch seems to be burning my wrist.  I don't wear it in the shower and it doesn't get wet."
567,Amazon Customer,3,the United States ,13-Oct-22,It'd be 5 stars if not for the bloatware and locked features,"Let me uninstall Bixby and use ECG without a Samsung account. I understand data is king but let me just use the hardware without the Samsung telemetrics please. It's a pain to have to root hardware just to get full functionality. It might be a good idea to get the blood pressure module approved before advertising it as well.Besides gating features behind an Samsung account, the hardware itself is well done. Fits my wrist well, band is comfy, and doesn't get hot at all. The heart beat, step, and blood O2 monitors are neat as well. Battery life isn't great (at 48% after about 8 hours of use) but I guess you can charge it before bed.I was looking forward to try the sleep analysis but it looks like snore detection is locked behind a Samsung account as well :("
568,Amazon Customer,3,the United States ,25-Oct-22,Some pluses and some negatives,"This is a very feature-packed watch. I'm not sure it's great for me, as, even with a large face, the features are so small that they are hard to read. Many offer the option of reading them on the phone, but then there is not much reason to have the watch!  The major disappointment is the very short battery life! It has to be charged every evening or it won't be charged enough through the night to monitor my sleep (which is important to me).  A lot of money for a fancy toy, I'm afraid!"
569,clever1,4,the United States ,22-Oct-22,"Works like it should, it's just a bit big for my taste","I was very hesitant to buy this watch because I was scared it would break on vacation and it was kind of big for my taste. I did so much research and asked many people who already had it and those who had different watches what they liked and didn't. I basically wanted a small waterproof smartwatch because I was going on vacation and was going to be in the water, both pool and sea, for a few weeks and would actually be in the water about 6 hours a day. I wanted to make sure this would not get water logged, overheat or have battery drain. I was very impressed.1. WATERPROOF - I did use the water block feature when I was actually in the water and it worked great. It tracked my activity correctly and logged all of my physical data. I was able to access most functions with water block on, obviously not some of the notifications, but the basic features worked well.2. OVERHEATING- When I was out of the water, and had water block off, it worked great, I was also in the direct sun for about 6-7 hours a day and worried it would overheat like a cell phone but it didn't at all. I was in temperatures around 90° and over for 6+ hours a day in full sun and it did not overheat or even feel hot or slow down. I did take care to keep my arm in the shade tho, when possible, I wasn't looking to break it.3. BATTERY DRAIN- I did not have any issues with battery drain at all. I did charge it every night, but that was just out of force of habit because I'd charge my phone every night too and both chargers were on my nightstand. The battery at night was always over 80% regardless of how much I accessed the features during the day. I used notifications, fitness, timers, reminders, email, and others. I traveled with it on for 19 hours straight and was in 4 different international time zones and it still had about 70% charge when I got back home.For me personally, the face it too big. That's just personal preference though. I understand you cannot make a watch with all the capabilities this one has with a tiny face. I personally prefer a watch to actually look like a watch and not a smartwatch, I wanted something that I could wear and have it look like a real watch. Knowing I'd have to sacrifice a quality and features to get that, I decided to buy this instead. I do not regret it. It's a durable and very functional watch."
570,Perfectly Imperfect,4,the United States ,15-Oct-22,Doesn't work or look appealing for dainty wrists,"I love technology, especially the newest and greatest. I want to love this watch, bad, so much I ordered a refurbished one in the past that was not working with my wrist. In hopes it was due to an error when refurbished, I purchased a new, non-refurbished one.With the band on the smallest setting it's still too big to pick up the settings from my skin. My wrists are abnormally small causing the face of the watch to look hideous. I went through the setup process to see what I was missing out on. I love the ability to make the face appear different for the style you are wearing as well as the occasion. The options available are similar to what my phone has, which is a bonus. One of my favorite perks the Samsung phone lacks is the day/date on the home screen near the time or battery percentage. I don't like having to unlock my phone to see the day and date.Hopefully smartwatches will come out in smaller sizes in the future. For now I will have to stick with an old analog phone that looks appealing. For those with standard wrists, I wouldn't hesitate yet would choose the newer Samsung watch with the rotating bevel."
571,Justin M. Rivera,4,the United States ,4-Dec-22,Still great on non Samsung phones!,"There's a few health tracking features that only work with Samsung phones, but many have work around.  Look into those beforehand if that is important to you!That said, I'm happy with mine!  I've been charging it while showering and have not had any concerns with battery life."
572,Isabel,4,the United States ,4-Dec-22,La batería no es buena,"Apenas lo estoy utilizando y la batería no apenas dura un día y medio sin mucho uso, solo conectado al bluetooth del celular. En el apartado de sueño no creo sea tan certero como el Fitbit Versa que usaba."

574,April allen,4,the United States ,6-Nov-22,Love everything but the battery life,"If you want to use the watch for anything other than steps and time, I get about 12ish hours before it gives a low battery warning. Would be 5 stars if had better battery."
575,Julia,4,the United States ,30-Oct-22,"Overall, I like the watch.","Overall, I like the watch. It has a lot of bells and whistles that eat the battery life. I am still attempting to narrow down exactly which apps I need to have running for better performance. The price was right so I went for the 4 instead of the 5."

579,gohl,5,the United States ,27-Nov-22,Love ❤️ 😍 💖,I really do love my watch. It is my favorite one I ever owned. This watch is very user-friendly. It was very easy to set up and use. I love that I can be across the house and still answer my phone. It does a great job counting my activity. My favorite is the fact I can wear it in the shower or doing dishes. My only complaint is that I have to charge it everyday.
580,Cindy Hanson,5,the United States ,5-Dec-22,LOVE this watch,"I love this watch.  It is easy to use, read and I like the weight (not heavy).  I have bought several bands and they are super easy to change."
581,Veronika M,5,the United States ,19-Nov-22,"Purchased for Sleep Monitoring, Happy I Did","This is my first smartwatch, and I must say, I am thrilled.Tracking sleep cycles was something I wanted to do-- and my watch did not disappoint.Adding google assistant to this watch has become a life-saver when on the go.Still learning the interface, and love the customizable watch faces.Only downside is that in the first few days, charging the watch will be needed due to the watch learning your battery patterns.Definitely an amazing product."
582,busy,5,the United States ,14-Nov-22,Love this watch!,"I really love everything about this watch. It tracks my sleep, exercise and steps so well. I've also been entering my food and water intake to see where I'm at. It connects well to my Samsung phone through Bluetooth and you can even see the pictures you get by text on your watch. The sound is clear on voice calls. I like the option to voice record your text messages.The only downside is the battery life. It's just over 24 hours,  so you have to take it off everyday to charge. It charges pretty quick,  maybe an hour. But then you aren't getting an accurate report on the things you track."
583,Shirley Dein,5,the United States ,9-Nov-22,Features on this watch and how well it syncs with my Android are awesome!,"I love this watch and the features like phone answering, text messages, etc.  It has a lot of features and many that I have not yet discovered.  The battery life could be a little longer but I have learned to put it on the charger first thing in the morning and then I am good for the remainder of the day/night.  The phone  feature on this watch makes me laugh out loud - almost like ""Dick Tracey"" and his watch phone from long, long ago!"
584,DeathDemon,5,the United States ,27-Oct-22,A very good and sleek smartwatch,"I use this in correlation with my Galaxy S22+. I have not used the sleep feature as of yet. The battery life goes pretty fast so I would not leave on the Always On Display and at most only have it turned on when you flip your wrist. As for the features, it has a lot of apps that you may have on your phone and it can read texts and incoming calls as well. I wouldn't use this with an iPhone of course. You can set it up to show notifications if you're not wanting to take out your phone. I use it mostly for snapchat notifications."
585,Steve,5,the United States ,6-Dec-22,Much better than Fitbit,Everything about this watch is great for except the battery life.  Has to be charged daily.

589,CaribbeanReviews,1,the United States ,6-Nov-22,Battery has malfunctioned after 6 months. I feel helpless.,"Summary: Do not buy the Venu 2 plus, the battery malfunctions.I bought this watch from amazon on May 27th. For context, the watch has never fallen or been harmed. I keep a screen protector on it and it is in excellent new condition. Initially the watch worked like a dreas. I had purchased the samsung watch 4 and venu 2S and returned both to get this Venu 2 plus because of the phone call feature and great battery life. I could answer calls easily, it faithfully tracked everything I needed, played music, helped me improve my fitness and most of all it gave me 7 (seven) days of battery life easily. I felt so happy and pleased with my purchase, I gushed about the watch to every and anyone.From September 1st the battery life began to steadily decrease. First it dropped to four days. Then to two days. Now on November 6th, it is at six hours. It took me so long to address the issue because my father is fighting colon, liver and prostate cancer so since June I have been focusing on him. Now on top of everything I have a crappy $450 paper weight on my wrist and I must find time to run around trying to contact Garmin (while I am in Barbados) in hopes of getting this mess sorted out. I am truly disappointed. So much so that I just regret ever choosing Garmin. I don't know if having it replaced would be better or if just getting my money back would be better. I am frankly too frazzled to process this right now. I don't have the energy to be angry, all I feel is helpless regret."
590,Lisa W.,1,the United States ,13-Jan-22,Just avoid if you want accurate,"Sending this back for a new Fitbit.,The garmin is so off on sleep.  It's not at all accurate.  I laid awake one night for several hours (thanks insomnia). Got up ate cookies drank wine ..went upstairs and laid on the couch in our bonus room to read one of my books.  The sleep tracking showed I was awake a full 5 minutes during this time.  Umm no Garmin, it took 5 minutes just to get my wine bottle opened.As far as the music feature unless you have basically 2 days to spend letting it download don't bother.  In a nutshell Garmin connect can't do that (or really anything) you have to download another app Garmin express but its anything but express.  Even leaving the watch near my phone overnight on the charger it still didn't have time to download.  Problem is app times out then you reconnect and it scans for 30-40 minutes says downloaded only to show no playlists on watch.  Useless.GPS is a joke it can't keep connection with satellites.  It's like that friend that can't make up their mind if they love or hate their partner.  We are soooo connected..nooo I hate those satellites I refuse to connect. Wait they just texted back so I love the satellites never mind they pissed me off again I'm breaking up with them.Battery life stinks if you want to use any of the features that attracted you initially to this watch. Maybe 2 days max if you use pulse/ox and gps.I had a Fitbit Versa 2 and it was much better watch.  I had been attracted to Garmin due to the fact that a lot of features I want with Fitbit I have to get a premium account to use whereas Garmin has them included.  But the takeaway I got from it is that Garmin includes them for free bc they don't work."
591,Louis Chupak,1,the United States ,21-Jan-22,Cannot control music during workout or adjust font size,"I had high hopes for this device, but was very disappointed. I thought this would be a great device to monitor my workouts and control my music without having to carry a phone. I was wrong. Here arefour reasons why.1. Set up and navigation are confusing with poor help from Garmin. As an example, installing the Spotify App requires updating the firmware. Garmin provides no guidance for updating without a computer. Luckily, I found a youtube video explaining how to update the firmware. Indeed, the interface is not intuitive and I found myself watching youtube several times to help figure things out. This was not optimal, but not a deal breaker.2. The watch uses activity apps to track your workout. So you start, say, the cycling app at the beginning of your ride and it records your distance, time and the course. It does not allow you to access the music controls when an app is running. So, you cannot use the watch to skip to the next song without stopping the activity app. Yup.3. The heart rate monitor does not work at high heart rates, say >140 bpm. I compared the readings to what I observe with a chest strap. This makes it impossible to do heart rate zone training.4. You cannot adjust the font size or colors. This won’t be an issue if your under 40, but was the deal breaker for me. I can barely read the tiny text and it will only get worse. Based on the 18 months of discussion (complaints) on the Garmin web site, I don’t expect any updates to address this issue.Hope this review helped. As another point of reference I suggest going to the Garmin App Store and reading the reviews for the Spotify App. I had the same issues described in the reviews downloading a playlist onto the watch."
592,Alex,1,the United States ,20-Nov-22,"Defective, it stopped working two times after a few weeks and now it's dead","Not lucky with this Garmin which I bought less than 2 months ago. When it stopped working the first time, Garmin made me reboot it. They knew exactly the kind of problem I was having (making me think it was something recurring for Garmin Venu Sq). I made the mistake of not returning it right away but I was about to leave for a trip and I needed a watch. Then it died again and this time for good. This time I'm going to return it. I wasn't anyway satisfied with it. My previous Samsung Active Watch 2 was much better than this one and had many more functions. Workout traking was very complicated to manage and phone connection was poor. The only things I appreciated about this Garmin were the GPS, the Garmin App, and the battery life, which was very good."
593,Mandy,1,the United States ,20-May-22,Will NOT sync to phone,"I don't normally write reviews (this is my first). This watch wouldn't sync to my iPhone no matter what I tried (for several frustrating hours) - uninstalling and reinstalling the app, resetting the app and resetting the watch, turning off and turning on, reloading multiple times, etc. Try as I might, it would never sync!! My Amazfit Band 5 works much better and it was only $49 when I got it two years ago! It syncs on the first try, is very accurate with all the tracking - workout, calories burned, heart rate, S02, stress, time, weather, and it even has a camera feature where the watch can control the shutter on my iPhone which is perfect for shots of large family gatherings, etc so I don't have to set the timer on my phone camera and then run quickly to get it the shot. With the camera feature, I can set up my phone, make sure everyone is in the shot and then take my time getting into the photo. This piece of crap Garmin which was roughly $150 and it doesn't even have that option. I just wanted something that looked a little fancier that I could wear with going out attire but, I'll keep my plain Jane Amazfit Band 5 any day of the week over that pretty, useless Garmin Venu Sq!!"
594,Randy Vose,1,the United States ,9-May-21,A huge disappointment for a Garmin device,"I have owned a Garmin Vivoactive HR for years with no issues and confidently bought the Venu SQ for my wife to track skiing and biking.  The Venu SQ has been a major disappointment from the start.  It's a beautiful looking device and my wife was initially very excited to have it.  Regrettably, those are the only two positives.  Once configured, the Venu SQ took forever (5+ minutes) to sync data to an iPhone after a single activity had been completed.  After completing an activity, the Venu SQ frequently displayed messages that it was low on memory and the activity data may be lost.  Recently, the Garmin Connect software showed a firmware update was available but it could not be applied because the Venu SQ didn't have enough memory available - even though all activity had been sync'd to Garmin Connect.  I bought this for the Ski app based on my experience with the Vivoactive HR Ski app.  We quickly learned the Ski app on the Venu SQ does not auto-lap between runs, presumably because it does not have an altimeter sensor.  You have to manually push a button at the end of each ski run to tell the SQ you have started a new run.  More than once my wife started a specific workout activity but the SQ tracked it as something else.  After months and months of frustration, we've given up on the Venu SQ and have replaced it with an Apple Watch Series 6.  Maybe the Venu SQ functions well as a very basic fitness device, but a lot of our time with jt was spent dealing with software and other technical shortcomings."
595,Shiblee Sadik,1,the United States ,31-Dec-20,Health hazard & wrong product review,"There are quite a few things wrong with the product. First, all the amazon revit are for Garmin Venu or something like that. I have no idea why that product review is relevant for this one. So the reviews are wrong and misleading.This is product review for Garmin Venu Sq. I bought it with full price from Amazon. It is a glorified healttracker. Yes, there is a screen but its funtionality is very limited. The watch is focused towards health tracking. All the health tracking functionality works perfect. I was impressed with the health stat tracking.In terms of screen fluidity, I found the screen is hard to use, it is jittery and the response is awefully slow. For example I tap on some button and swipe the screen after that, you would never know what gonna happen. You need to wait a few second after you tapping on something. The worst part is tap doesn't always work. So, I found it extremely difficult to use this product as smart watch.Some of the smartwatch functionality such as notification works fine. The screen resolution is not very good but it is workable.Finally the belt. As you probably can see from the picture the belt is causing allergic reaction for my skin. Now may or may not happen for everybody but I am certain the reaction is not unique to my skin. The belt need to be avoided at any cost. Overall it was a bad experience for me and I recommend avoiding this watch."
596,Peter Jones,1,the United States ,14-Mar-22,Doesn’t live up to Garmin hype/Doesn’t play music,"I’ve been running for years and have always carried my phone for music and distance tracking. After joining a running club where everyone raved about their fitness trackers, I decided to take the plunge and ask for one as a Christmas present. After doing a ton of research, I settled on Garmin’s Forerunner 245 with Music. I thought it would be a fancy new toy that would revolutionise my life. I was wrong. It was not obvious how to connect to Spotify. I had to download Garmin on my phone and computer to update the device’s software. It’s a brand new device, so I figure it should come up-to-date?? The device will only download a fraction of a playlist before saying the download failed. It will not connect to my headphones. And to top it off, the GPS is really bad. Where my normal pace on my phone says 8-9 minutes, Garmin put my pace between 10 and 11 minutes. I thought it was just the product, so I returned it and ordered the Venu Sq. But it has all the same problems.I really don’t understand how this product can be on the market with so many flaws and why so many people are big fans. I guess it’s too much to ask for a fitness tracker to play music and measure distance accurately. Please let me know if you have any recommendations that aren’t terribly expensive."
597,AmySparkles,1,the United States ,4-Nov-22,I returned it.,"I had this watch for about a week. I updated it on the first day and didn't know that it wasn't able to save my workouts because that update filled the rest of it's teeny tiny memory card. I got online and tried to follow their help guide and it got me nowhere. On top of the full memory, the screen was horrible and laggy. You also had to press precisely on the button on screen or it wouldn't detect your finger. I returned it to Amazon quickly."
598,jph,1,the United States ,14-Jul-22,Awful display,"To echo another reviewer: “I have owned many Garmin devices and this is by far the least liked so far. Band was rigid and probably would eventually crack. Always on display was never always on. What good is a watch if you have to tap it to see the time. I have returned it and back with my Vivoactive 4S. A much better watch.”The biggest problem was the display disappearing. There is no way to use the sweep second hand to time anything, such as someone else’s heart rate (think medical personnel). To get the display back I’d have to tap hard on it multiple times, even set at high sensitivity. Battery life isn’t great either, I’m guessing their measurements of battery life are done with the screen totally off all the time.I have gone back to my Vivoactive 4s even though it’s battery life is degrading and it no longer tracks flights of stairs."
599,Doru C,2,the United States ,18-Feb-22,Rewarding but annoying at the same time,"Has tons of features and many of them are actually useful.The Garmin ecosystem is very nicely integrated, featured and polished.This watch has a lot to like - comprehensive sleep analyzer (including SPO2, REM, stress, etc), continuous HR, gesture-triggered display-on, a lot of customization options for the screen, GPS & tracking, decent battery life (~5 days with my settings), small size (most smart watches are bigger than what I'm comfortable with).Now for the negatives:- Freezes when logging hikes - very often, every ~1 out of 3 hikes. Takes a long time and a fuzzy procedure to restart.- Freezes when recharging - sometimes. Always comes back up but whenever it wants, not when I want it, stays frozen for minutes even when I long press buttons to reset.- Uncontrollable in the water - the touchscreen is completely confused in the water.- The auto-display-freeze is useful - after 1 minute it freezes display so I don't change things by accidentally touching screen. But its implementation is amateurish and plain stupid: when I touch the screen just shows me a screen of a lock for 2 seconds ... Gosh, I just want to see the info on the screen, not some random picture of a lock ... just show me the screen even when the screen is locked! Could use some other way to indicate that the screen is locked, like flashing screen or drawing an outline at the edge of the screen, etc- HR seems accurate when resting but useless at high HR and during any kind of exercise. Cannot - I repeat - cannot be used to monitor HR during exercises, regardless of the kind of exercise: running, gym, biking. I have a chest strap for that purpose. I only use the HR from this watch to check HR at night and when relaxed. Quite a dissapointment.All in all it works for me - not perfect but then very few things are.[Edit, 2022-02-21] Freezing beyond acceptable. While hiking, whether I'm logging or not, it freezes very often - if the hike is more than 2 hours then it will probably freeze. Absolutely not acceptable. Downgrading to 2 stars. Not recommended anymore.Also, another negative - why doesn't it connect to my bike's power meter? It does have Bluetooth ... if it logged biking power then i wouldn't have needed an expensive bike computer ..."
600,Marsha Mars,2,the United States ,11-Jul-22,Died after one month.,"I had worn a Fitbit for 9 years, was mostly pleased with this brand, however, found myself needing to purchase a new tracker. After reading on many different models, decided to go with the Garmin Venu SQ. It arrived in a timely manner and was relatively easy to set up. Found it comfortable to wear, even to sleep, I could never do that with Fitbit. It tracked steps well, sleep, and stress level. There are many features with this watch that my old Fitbit did not have. The app is very useful and helps you to track your health better. The band was very comfortable and I was hesitant about it at first. These are the positives.The most disappointing thing about this was I had worn the watch just over a month, charging every four days, and a little over a month in, it just quit. Completely quit. Cannot reboot it, cannot erase my information from it. Just dead.Amazon customer service is EXCELLENT and they secured me a replacement Garmin Venu SQ, I did have the option to obtain a refund, but requested a new watch and will return this one. I am hoping that I just received the one bad apple and that the new one will work as should, for a long time. I will update this review  when I have had it more than a month. So, for now, this watch receives an overall 2 star rating from me, it was a great watch, but if it will not work for more than a month, then it is a useless watch.Fingers crossed!"
601,Katrah,2,the United States ,28-Mar-22,Inaccurate distance. Filled up memory with menstrual tracking... I'm a dude.,"-Just tried to update it and it said memory storage was full. I Checked and 128kb of the 1500 were of Menstrual Cycle Tracking... 1) I don't have that turned on. 2) I am registered as a male. Why is it tracking and recording that in the background when I haven't given it access to do so.-I got this in the first place for tracking ROWING. Found no other watch that could compare to it. Strokes per minute at a glance of the watch is amazing! Seeing afterwards the maximum spm and average spm in a graph with Heart Rate and all is perfect!-Sleep Tracking is mediocre at best. If I pee 3 times during the night it might show me as awake once or twice..-Distance is off. And Garmin is WELL KNOWN for their distance being off. You will have to run farther using a Garmin than other watches.-Calories are short. There's no way I do 120+ HR core work for 30 minutes and burn 25 calories... Yes I have age and weight updated regularly.-Sometimes Heart Rate Sensor doesn't work when doing stationary biking. Usually at higher heart rate and almost always when shifting to standing then back to sitting. If I use a chest HR monitor that connects to the Garmin THEN it will accurately record HR during a workout. Its a shame because chest straps are restrictive and tend to slide down when running for me at least.-FOR THE PRICE, its great. SO much better than the FitBit charge 3 that I was using. But only 1 year of memory has filled it up and there is NO WAY to easily erase it all. I've had to request Garmin to erase all memory of me to fix that. But for all I know it will just fill up again secretly recording my menstrual cycles... as a dude.... lol!"
602,K,2,the United States ,17-Oct-22,Need to improve sleep tracking,"So I have tried 3 different Garmin watches -- and my biggest problem with all have been the sleep tracking (they need to improve this!!!)- this one said that I had slept 23.5 hours in one day even thought I was up, played with the app on the phone and the actual watch its and did a 45 min cardio workout all while it said I was sleeping. lol.  Since I work graveyard correct sleep tracking is important to me even if its outside my normal/programmed sleep times.  and from what i can tell you have to have times set.Everything else that I used seemed to work just fine.  and I do love the round watch face look."
603,MICHAEL,2,the United States ,22-Oct-22,Surprisingly Disappointed,"My expections weren't low enough. The watch won't pair reliably. Paired it this morning turned it off turned it back on this evening and it wouldn't reconnect to a Samsung z fold. The instinct I have willl pair without issue.More importantly the Venu isn't compatible with the Garmin Explore app. That's a deal breaker. I need location tracking in real time on a map on a screen I can see. It doesn't do that. It has a touchscreen, but it isn't bright enough.The fitness tracking is mediocre. I have to plug it on to a PC just to retrieve somewhat accurate fitness dataUsing it for media storage maybe, okay. Beyond that, iIt's not going to do what I need."
604,7mtns4k,2,the United States ,8-Aug-22,"Great watch, difficult/non-intuitive UI missing basic features. Accurate recording makes it great.","This watch is great and frustrating at the same time. The accuracy, tracking and the fact that all computing can be done on the watch with out the need for cloud connectivity (unlike Samsung who all of a sudden started to require privacy invasive Samsung accounts just to keep using your health app and the reason I switched) makes this watch a huge win.The big downside to this watch is the usability. While it does take time to get used to a new User Interface - This watch could greatly benefit from a more intuitive, easier to use interface. Basic things like a pull down from top menu to control the basics - Airplane mode, Bluetooth/GPS on/Off just don't exist. You can't swipe away notifications, the buttons are frustratingly backwards and don't allow you to customize. i,e  the top button should be back, not force you in to selecting a workout every time.This watch could be a bigger win with UI changes. However, the battery, accuracy (Maybe the sleep records awake as light sleep a bit) and reliability do make this a good unit"
605,Brandon Bigam,2,the United States ,6-Jun-21,Buggy with erratic battery life,"I really thought and hoped that this would finally be the right premium fitness/smartwatch I'd been looking for. It's not. It does have a lot of great fitness and health features and a beautiful screen. But it has a lot of problems, far more than a watch at this price should get away with.Problems:-Sync issues: it syncs slowly, even just a minute after the previous sync if you close and open the app. And it has trouble syncing sleep info; it can take an hour or more to show up in the app, even with repeated syncs. This is noted on the Garmin forums too, with no solution.-Several random crashes/reboots. In fairness, the latest public beta firmware seems to fix this; but it's still a beta a couple of weeks later.-Erratic battery life and battery drain. Sleep tracking overnight (without pulse ox) can drain 3% or 30% for no apparent reason. This is noted on the forums too. This kind of inconsistency makes the watch unreliable. The suggested solution seems to be to uninstall third-party apps, watchfaces, and data fields. So what's the point of having an app store?Poor design:-No airplane mode option at all.-No quick option to turn off the always-on display (AOD) on the fly. You have to dig through multiple menus.-Convoluted interface that sometimes requires buttons, sometimes touchscreen, without rhyme or reason. Also some settings are only in the app, some only on the watch, again for no apparent reason.-Poor selection of analog watchfaces that have a minimal AOD for power saving.-""Let's get moving"" alerts seem to trigger and clear completely at random. For example, maybe only a few minutes after sitting down from an activity, or while driving. Then hours later it will suddenly notify me that the move alert cleared. Not helpful.-A thick watch case combined with a textured bezel that feels like a nail file makes for a watch that's difficult a slide a long sleeve over. Maybe okay for a pure fitness watch, but not for one also marketed for ""lifestyle/smartwatch"" type features.Quite disappointed with this, and returning it as defective. Samsung was equally disappointing. Going back to Amazfit which is less fully featured but works smoothly with great battery life."
606,lmzrsk,2,the United States ,17-Jan-22,Liked it but Returned It: Open Firmware Issue,"I have had a Venu (1) for years and liked it.  And decided to upgrade to the new Venu 2.  When I first got it, i was impressed by the new snapshots and the screen.  I set it up as normal, and then a few days later an issue popped up.  I also like to use the Connect IQ apps to fill in the gaps in the Garmin Apps that come with the unit.  I downloaded the Hiking, Running and Cycling Professional App (just like on my Venu 1.  Got them all set up and then decided to move them to my favorites and rearrange the apps to match what I currently have.  I used the Connect phone app to do that.  Image my surprise when I opened my watch and all the apps were gone.  The downloaded apps were erased (including the music apps) and I had to reinstall the Garmin apps.  So, i did this a few more times with the same result.I then went on the Garmin Forum and found a listing in which they admit it is a issue with all Venu 2’s.  They are aware of it and the Engineers are working on it.  With no time line provided.  Since, at least to me, this is not a trivial purchase i noted my complaint on the forum and, after talking with Amazon support (who are very good), decided to return the watch.  I dropped that onto the Garmin Forum and they again told me they are working on it and don’t use the Connect IQ apps until they have a fix.  Thank you, but no thank you.I decided to return the watch and went back to my Venu 1, which works just fine.  Garmin… troubleshoot your firmware better!"
607,Eric,2,the United States ,26-Jan-22,DISAPPOINTED,"Used for 11 days and the problems just keep popping up.1. The brightness adjustment doesn't work, at all. It seems like the watch just decides on its own to get brighter and get more dim occasionally. And no, auto brightness is not on.2. HR sensor works really well until my wrist gets sweaty. Then it's consistently 70-80 bpm off despite my heart rate being closer to 160.3. A heart rate app that I downloaded and used for a few days is suddenly missing from the watch. I used it just yesterday and now it's gone.4. The screen doesn't wake when I look at the screen any longer and there's no setting that I can find that allows that. Then when I tap on the screen to wake it up, it occasionally takes several taps to wake up - laggy. It's frustrating.As much as I do like this watch, these bugs all need to be fixed. I'll be returning this watch and looking for something different.Edit 01/28/22 - I thought about giving this watch a couple more days to see if I can get past these problems. Terrible idea. Problems continue. Now my Venu 2 Plus has seized up with nothing on the screen, the buttons don't operate, and when I double tap on the screen I only volume up/down. I can't exit that screen and the volume up/down do nothing.Btw the seller did accept my return and the original shipping was faster than the quoted expected time. This review isn't a knock on the seller at all - just the Venu 2 Plus."
608,Please,2,the United States ,7-Dec-22,"Important stuff is there, but app is extremely unpolished","The important stuff like steps tracking, heart rate tracking, etc is there, but the app is extremely buggy and unpolished. Can't get Spotify to link up to watch, because the Connect app on my iPhone won't prompt me to launch Spotify."
609,Shadoza,3,the United States ,28-Jul-22,"I've own 7 devices, 3 brands, love Polar but Garmin wins, here's why","BRAND Comparison:Fitbit – Pro: it is intuitive.  Con: Micro-transactions.  User is expected to pay monthly fees for services already on the device.  Caters to Corporations rather than consumer.Polar – Pro: accuracy in HR readings, offers arm band and chest strap combinations.  Con:  Expensive, zero customer service, Web and phone services cater to new models / Operating systems.  Won’t play nice with older systems.Garmin – Pro:  does not charge extra monthly fees for features already on the device.  If you don't like the hard band, there are hook and loop after-market bands that work well. The website and phone app works reasonably well with older software.  Doesn’t offer an armband, BUT, the Polar arm band works when the sensor feature is turned on!  Yes, you can use your Polar OH1 with your Garmin Venu Sq.  Con: Garmin’s customer service is not as good as it once was.  The live chat only works on some platforms.Garmin Features(Notice:  There are more features, these are the ones I related to.)Sleep1. The sleep time goal cannot be adjusted.  It is set to 8 hours and cannot be moved to more or less.  Garmin has indicated they have no plans to change this.2. The sleep readings are not very accurate.  If one lays in bed after waking up and move their eyes around, the device will call it REM sleep...even if one is not sleeping.  If one gets up to use the bathroom or let the pet in/out, the sleep reading may restart once sleep is resumed.  (If one adjusts the sleep time to correct this issue, they will lose the Pulse Ox data, for the entire day if the all-day feature is turned on.)3. The hours slept cannot be adjusted without screwing up the Pulse Ox readings, the Body Battery (energy) readings, and the Stress reduction readings.  Seems they are all co-dependent on reaching that forced 8 hour goal.  None will work well for those that sleep on their arm and may not work well for those that sleep on their side.Weight Maintenance1. Weight maintenance works in tandem with a third-party app called MyFitnessPal.  (Good app but requires newer phone model to download.)2. Using the Calories In/Out feature for weight control removes the total calories burn reporting from the phone app.  Kind of annoying if one has a burn goal.Calories1. The calories report only gives weekly / monthly active calories.  (Again if one has a daily burn goal, too bad for you.)2. The daily, live, readings are good.  It provides the total burn, then shows the breakdown of active and resting (non-active) totals.  (It only does this if one is not working with weight control features.)3. User can set calorie burn goals but the phone app does not respect them (keep reports on that goal.)  User cannot set a daily burn goal.Pulse Ox1. This feature has issues related to the sleep feature.2. The device offers a sleep only, all day automatic, and manual use.3. Doesn't matter which you choose the device will default to average readings or last reading at times.  4.  Turing off the sleep readings while leaving on the all-day readings will result in no posting of all day readings.  You can see them on the device but not on the apps.  Turning off the automatic reads (both sleep and all day,) one can still manually read, and these numbers (accurate or not) will report to the app.Respiration1. Works during sleep regardless of the Pulse Ox setting.2. If one uses the breathing feature to relax, some strange readings may occur.  For me, using the relax feature decreases the reported count to 3 breaths per minute and increases the stress.3. Respiration rate does not appear to report during exercise.  (I find this annoying.)Heart Rate1. Is reasonably accurate when compared to other brands and other devices.2. Keeping the wrist band high on the wrist is required to gain accurate readings.  Not comfortable but functional.3. Resting rate is not a resting rate.  It is the daily low.  There doesn’t seem to be a feature of actual taking of resting heart rate.4. Low, high, and current (live) rates are available on the phone app.  The device reads the heart rate about every 5 minutes or when activity is detected (this feature can be changed.)5. If the device is set to read real time, a notice suggests the battery could be drained faster.  I use that option and charge every two to three days with activity.6. The customization of the device (some of which are downloaded separately) provide many options for seeing this data during a workout.Body Battery1. The body energy feature is not functional in my opinion.  It is tightly related to sleep hours, patterns, readings.  If the user has different sleep metrics then the device, they will find their energy level does not recharge even if one feels they’ve had a good sleep.2. The body battery drains all day during activity.  If one wants to recharge (relax,) the move feature will harass them to get up and move, which results in more drain.  Not a good feature; it can be removed or ignored.Stress1. The stress feature is also based on the unfortunate sleep feature.  Movement causes stress, not moving causes the move feature to harass.  It’s stressful on its own. (stress feature can be removed or ignored.)2. Using the option to de-stress by included programs caused me more stress so that didn’t work well.Other1. The option to download widgets, apps, faces, is great.  Not every item is good but the selection and options are.2. Faces included are customizable.  (Includes both analog and digital faces.)3. Nice face appearances and data selections are included, but the information doesn’t talk about this so take a look before hunting for a new face.4. Features are mostly customizable.  (User is not forced to look at golf apps / widgets if they don’t golf.)  Remove the ones you won’t use, keep the ones you will.  Space is limited so choose wisely.5. If a featured item is removed, it can be reinstalled."
610,Mike,3,the United States ,29-Nov-22,"Great fitness tracking, but not a good smartwatch","I bought this in an attempt to get away from the major Android watch manufacturer. I do not heavily use smartwatch features, but I value a few things beyond fitness tracking.Primarily, I want to be able to view and interact with notifications without having to take out my phone.  Instantly, I was let down by the Garmin Venu 2+. The notification delivery was very unreliable, often not even notifying on my watch or notifying with a heavy delay of 5-10 seconds. Once the notification was on the watch, the ability to action on the notification was pretty poor. You have to scroll all the way through the whole notification to be able to get to the action links - compare to other watches where you always have an action hamburger menu available - which is a poor UX. If you have multiple notifications, good luck. You can only immediately action on the latest, and the other notifications you have to navigate through the glances menu which takes a lot of inputs to get through. Compare to other watches where all notifications are immediately accessible from the home watch screen. Not to mention, there is no ability to suppress notifications when you are using the phone, something that I took for granted on other watches.The supporting phone software is also pretty poor. Trying to install new watch faces took hours as the app just didn't want to install them onto the phone. I googled this and apparently this has been an issue for years and the solution is...just keep reopening the app until it works. Disappointing to say the least. And the Garmin Connect app, while it has a huge amount of metrics, is sadly restrictive. I can't even push my weight into the app from my smart scale because they only allow Garmin scales to do that.Another major feature missing is wireless charging. What kind of a watch releases in these times without wireless charging? The watch does come with a very short proprietary charger. Fortunately, it doesn't need to charge that often, but it is a far cry from just throwing the watch on a wireless pad when showering.The fitness sensors are the only redeeming features here. They are definitely better than other watches you can get. But, how much better? I did a comparison with another watch and found that despite all the accuracy hype...they were pretty much the same. On a 3 mile walk, distance was 0.02 miles difference, and calories burned were within 10. The GPS appeared smoother on the Venu, but was pretty much identical otherwise. I would argue unless you are doing heavy training, particularly running, you are fine with the sensors on other watches.All in all, this is a beautiful watch that I really wanted to like, but it seems that Garmin has not yet grasped what makes a ""smartwatch"" easy to use. Making a tree of menus is not fun. If they could bring that finishing touch and add basic functionality like wireless charging, this would be a killer watch. Unfortunately, they haven't yet."
611,Bird and Wildlife Photography by Anjeanette,3,the United States ,20-Dec-21,Garmin venu sq smartwatch,"I have been wanting a smartwatch for awhile and in the past have only had money for the cheap knockoffs on Amazon that cost $35 or less and I really wanted something nicer. So I researched reviews on Amazon between Fitbits and Garmin smartwatches and decided to give the Garmin Venu Sq a try.Positives:  This smartwatch is really nicely built, has a comfortable feeling while wearing day and night. You can download the connect IQ store app to purchase different watch faces for a really cheap price and can buy different watch bands through Amazon which is nice too.  The other thing that I really like about this smartwatch is how super easy it was to pair with my android phone and I love the app. It is super easy to navigate and see all the awesome data that it provides.  I also like how you can make connections with people who are using Garmin devices and challenge them in the app on different things weather its getting more steps in or other types of activities.  It also has GPS which really is nice to have.  Negatives: I have noticed that the sleep tracking is pretty bad on this smartwatch,  it's very inaccurate and in the 4 days I have had it its only recorded two nights of my sleep and even then it was off on the time I fell asleep and when I tried to change the time in the app for my bed time it manually added my sleep time and I could not find a way to delete that. That was very frustrating to me because it should not be that hard to delete and it totally pissed me off when I couldn't. At $160.00 there shouldn't be this issue. I have also noticed that when I am taking walks it will not record my steps for the first several minutes or my activity like on my watch nor in the app even though I make sure its synced with each other before starting my walks. It starts recording my walk sometimes at the half way mark which is so weird and messed up.  It should start recording as soon as I start my walk otherwise its totally off and inaccurate on my steps , calories and my distance.  My sleep and my steps are like the most important things to me.  The other information that I get from this watch is neat to see but isn't as important to me.  And unfortunately neither of these two things work all that well. One more thing that is pretty disappointing is the battery life. i have had to charge this watch twice now in four days. That's awful. I'm going to update this review probably in a couple of weeks to see if anything improves with more time.  But if I find anymore issues with it or continue to have the same problem with it I will be returning this watch.Update January 4th 2022,  I got this watch in mid December 2021 and it has helped motivate me more than anything.  I have been walking more and challenging myself to get more steps in everyday.  It's also fun to challenge others on the Garmin connect app.  Since December 22 2021 I have lost 8lbs. I'm really shocked I have lost that much weight.  Yesterday Jan 3rd I hit my highest mileage of 6.5 miles and 15,000 steps. That's just taking between 3-5 walks a day.As far as the watch goes its still horrible at tracking my sleep information. I asked on the Garmin connect Facebook group how to make the battery last longer and got some great tips. Last night I downloaded a watch face that is battery saving and turned off the vo2max and pulse ox settings and setup do not disturb times which helps make the battery last longer. After making those changes my watch went from 100% to 98% from 9pm last night to now at 1:12pm which is much much better than what it was doing. The sleep tracking though still is basically useless.  The body battery also is not worth much because it's based on how much sleep I get and if that isn't accurate than the body battery isn't much use either. So basically I bought an expensive to me step counter and connection app with a couple other ok features.  I will keep this watch only because I don't have any more money to get me something nicer and that might work better. I did end up buying this exact watch for one of my younger twin sisters for Christmas before I had a chance to really know the downfalls of it. And also my other twin sister who lives in Texas bought herself one as well. She is use to a fitbit which she has had for 3 years and loved it but it was finally wearing out and not working properly anymore and she got this one. I'm not sure she is all that impressed with her choice to buy the Garmin venu sq."
612,Nicole,3,the United States ,29-Nov-22,Bad at tracking steps on treadmill,"Bought it after I bought a treadmill thinking it would be great at tracking my steps.  I have to get 8000 steps in a day to get rewarded from HSA account.  Well I put 2 watches on, this Garmin watch and my old Fitbit versa on to see if they match in steps.  Well my Garmin watch was a 1000 steps off about from my fitbit.  Even when I put the Garmin watch on Treadmill setting.  Disappointing!"
613,evo1,3,the United States ,26-Sep-22,Better Battery Life than Apple Watch,"I like the watch mainly bought it to help me track steps. Had an apple watch that bit the dust after long use so I can compare the two.For everyday use ( steps, time, faces, ...I think both are equal. Just make sure whatever you pick has whichever specific features you want. For me, the Garmin checked all my boxes and blew the apple watch out of the park with battery life. I get almost a week before charge and 2-3 days when I activate oxygen monitoring all day.Did the Venu music but really have never used the feature.I want to love it but last few weeks I have been wearing it less due to the band causing skin irritation on my wrist. I saw similar complaints prior to buying and thought ahh! am sure it's a fluke. I don't shower with the watch. I dry my wrists completely after showering and use lotion and stuff. Not sure what I am doing wrong but I feel Garmin failed on the band part. For this reason, I am not in love with the watch. Just beware  overall nice watch but unsure If I will stick to Garmin products."
614,A. Robinson,3,the United States ,10-Nov-22,"Really great, accurate fitness tracker, that doesn’t work with iPhone/iMessage","Pros: This watch has everything you need in a watch for exercise…built in heart rate monitor, accurate distance tracking, and an App Store, including apps that play music like Spotify.Cons: This watch does not work with iMessage, your only option is to disable it and use text message if you want to get notified on the watch. In fact after the fact all of their documentation references Android.If I had the choice between this an the Apple Watch knowing this con, I would have not selected this watch, that’s how important leaving iMessage enabled & still getting notified is for me."
615,Anne,3,the United States ,26-Oct-22,Missed the mark for me,"This is a nice watch. I like the functionality (sleep tracking, pedometer etc) and it's a nice looking watch. Unfortunately this watch is missing a critical feature I need. While it does track your heart rate, it does not broadcast your heart rate using ANT+ or Bluetooth. Had to dig quite deep to find that information as Garmin doesn't make it easy. The more expensive models do have that capability, but the more expensive watches just don't look nice on a female wrist in my opinion. I am a female professional leader and I can't walk around wearing a heavy black rubber looking watch on my wrist with all kinds of buttons sticking out."
616,C. Renee Freeman,3,the United States ,6-Feb-22,"Spot-On Performance? Nah, but Still OK","If you are the kind of person who would become incensed that a device recorded two steps when you took five, buy something else.Keep in mind that hospitals do not slap a fitness tracker device on your wrist to measure heart rate, pulse ox, et cetera. This device will give you basic health information, but it is never going to be as precise as devices that attach in other spots. It will never be spot on with its performance data.The pulse ox measurement is not accurate at all. Sleep tracking is suspicious to me because the numbers change throughout the day, and no one can tell me why. Overall, though, if you go into this with the mindset that the device is providing general (and not spot on) data, you won't be disappointed.The device is comfortable enough to wear all day and at night. It provides good enough data for my purposes. I am not and have zero intentions of ever being an elite athlete. I just wanted basic info that was ""close enough"" to accurate. If I want more precise data, I can hook up a pulse oximeter to my finger or slap on a blood pressure cuff. For your average use, it's just fine, especially at this price point.So - unless you really, really need spot-on accuracy, this device is fine.Also - look closely at these reviews. For some inexplicable reason, Amazon puts reviews of the Venu Sq product on the page for the Venu product. Garmin makes two devices - Venu and Venu Sq. The price point and features of each product is widely different, so pay attention.P.S. I like this Venu Sq product much better than every Fitbit I have ever owned. It is much more comfortable. Having the interface on my phone is very convenient. I don't need a subscription for every data point. It's just a better product, IMO."
617,ck4him,3,the United States ,21-Oct-22,Not Worth It,"This watch has been more of a time piece than a fitness tracker. Some features work okay, but for the most part, this has been a frustrating disappointment. It disconnects from my phone all the time. I have done all the troubleshooting that supposedly fixes this problem, yet it does not. Customer support is terrible. The interface is not user friendly. I do appreciate the GPS feature and that actually works very well. However, I would not buy this watch again."
618,Amazon Customer,3,the United States ,29-Oct-22,"Love this watch, but...",This watch is amazing. I seriously love it. GPS is way better then the previous fitbit i used to have. Interface is awesome as well. The quality feels great and it looks super sleek as well. My only complaint is how quickly the buttons broke. The 'back' button has broken and i bought it just three months ago. Disappointing for the price.
619,Alyssa,4,the United States ,27-Nov-22,I love it but...,"I love my watch BUT the instruction booklet wasn't great so I didn't know you had to download a separate app to get different watch faces, or exactly how the workouts work (the app has A LOT of features and is not intuitively organized). The step tracking seems accurate BUT the mileage my watch says I've done based on steps is pretty inaccurate. GPS calibration didn't work well and I've had the thing for more than a month and just found there's a custom stride length you can input which still needs some dialing in but the mileage is getting closer. This involves a lot of playing with it and trial and error. I wouldn't say it's out of the box ready unless you're familiar with Garmin devices, but it is an excellent watch with lots of tools that you can choose to include or not."
620,Jess Jennings,4,the United States ,4-Dec-22,Forget the data and live .,"This is the 4th ""Smart"" watch for me . All pretty much have the same flaw , they may do one thing well but they are all very inaccurate .  I caught myself fixating on ""measured ""parameters . I was a heart rate junkie , SO2 junkie , a rem junkie and so on. I understand trying to achieve health goals and the watches may help but only in the sense they are toys and only as smart as the user .  All watches warn against basing anything on the data they measure . About the only thing I liked was changing faces and the ""Dick Tracey"" novelty. I submit a new name .  ""Toy Watches"""
621,Everett,4,the United States ,2-Oct-22,"Awesome battery life,  and perks but the heart rate monitor is terrible","I bough this watch based on a YouTube video showed data suggesting that the heart rate monitor was similar to a chest strap.  No, not even close, at worst it is off by up to 30 bpm and at best it is off by 5 to 10 beats but that only occurs when you are ""sitting still or sleeping"".  However, given that everything else about the watch is pretty good and the battery life is excellent (I get at least 6 days out of a charge), I will give it a thumbs up.  To be fair, all of the fitness trackers with wrist-based heart monitors are grossly inaccurate.  Therefore, I bought a cheap ($30.00) heart strap which solved the problem.  Allow me a moment to vent for a moment to suggest that these companies are aware that their wrist-base heart rate monitors are ""terribly inaccurate"" but they promote the function anyway.  I basically have to synch down a fitness tracker to the point that it makes my hand tingle in order to get a better but still inaccurate reading.  My target HR during cardio is between 175 and 180, neither this watch or my Fitbit (I wear them at the same time to compare their function and accuracy)  ""consistently"" projected heart rates this high.  However, after buying a chest chest strap, and syncing it with the Garmin (Fitbit will not allow you sync other chest straps) my HR number are as expected.  In short, this Garmin is a nice watch but if your heart rate is important to you be prepared to invest in a chest strap or perhaps consider fitness trackers that come with a dedicated chest strap.  I hope this is helpful!"
622,Nema,4,the United States ,5-Nov-22,Great battery life,"I had a Samsung Watch 4 classic.  The screen is great.  The features are great, but when battery life is ~26 hours for basic features, and it takes more than an hour to charge, i'm waiting for my watch every day.My replacement is this Venu 2.  The screen is just as good, and battery life is about 5 days.  If I charge the watch when getting ready for work in the morning, the battery never runs out. I don1t wear my Samsung watch anymore.One feature that Garmin should add is an FDA approved heart monitor.  With that feature, the Samsung watch would never sell."
623,Jared,4,the United States ,25-Feb-22,"Great all around watch, excellent replacement for previous other popular brand","I have previously used several of another very popular brand of health & fitness tracking watches.  Some slide over into the smart watch category.  What I have found is that no matter what the features are, no matter how ""awesome"" the watch looks & performs, it doesn't matter if battery life can't make it at about a week.If I have to remember to charge my watch & take it off to do so (which defeats the purpose of all the nifty tracking stuff) then it will frustrate me.  I should be able to go away for a weekend and not have to lug another charger along with me and probably lose it.  Anything less than a week, I'll end up not using for very long.I have this watch 4 stars **** instead of 5, because of this watch is a 5, then Garmin could stop here.  They wouldn't need watches that cost twice as much and have 2, 3, or more than 4 times the battery life.  At this price point, it's probably 4½ starts.  If it was $100 less, maybe it would be a 5 star at that price point.  It's all perspective.  For the price I paid, MSRP, I would like a few things to be better, ideally battery life.This watch manages about a week, although just barely (certain adjustments or using certain features will increase our decrease that if course), but it still has all of the fancy sensors (and quality ones at that) and pretty decent software.  Decent.  There's some room for improvement.  Navigating through it's menus takes some getting used to, and there's some things that I have to look up or just fiddle with for awhile to remember how to find.  They have added a way to remove certain menu items you don't use or need, and you've always been able to edit their order.  The sleep software is adequate, but after using that other previous brand, it really shows where they can improve there, and in the 8 months I've had it, I have seen some minor improvement.  I would love to see it do a better job of determining when I'm sleeping, even if it's a 30 minute nap, on it's own, instead of me telling it when I sleep.Overall, it's a great watch.  I consider it to be a nice step up from previous brand, and it has convinced me to eventually step up into one of the even more expensive watches, if for no other reason than the even much better battery life.  As long as I continue to see improvements, I'll gift this one to a family member and make the leap, but I think ifd about a week is what you need to get by, you will not be disappointed.Pros:-Very durable-Adequate battery life, not ""long""-Lots of features and quality sensors-Looks great, and has a quality look and feel-Partially customizable menus+MoreCons:-Battery life at this price point I feel should be better, but for Garmin you need to pay at least double this for better battery life and these features-Sleep software is still in the earlier stages for Garmin (I believe they had just purchased a company that was doing this and that software is still being tweaked and continually developed)-Menus could be better streamlined.  Adding new watch faces from the Connect IQ app is not the simplest task.  I also hate that I have to have multiple apps on my phone for my watch."
624,Mike,4,the United States ,5-Nov-22,Great allaround watch,"This is a great budget watch by Garmin. It's sleep tracking feature is okay, but Garmin's body battery feature is one of the very important features that rival other smartwatch makers. It's GPS isn't as accurate and make note it only uses Gortilla glass 3 and aluminum bezel so be sure to buy some protection for it. Garmins app is great and has some of the best reviews out of many other smartwatch apps. It's a great buy as long as you don't mind buying something extra to protect it, and you don't need amazing GPS precision."
625,Bob,4,the United States ,12-Oct-22,Good all around health tracking watch,Pros:- Battery last at least a week with normal use; charges really fast (main reason I chose Garmin watch over others)- Lots of data tracking- Comfortable to wear all day and during sleep- Customizable watch faces from the Connect IQ app- Can receive text/email messages from android phoneCons:- Doesn't come with a wall outlet charging adapter (have to use one from another watch or phone)- Occasional syncing issues; seemed to happen after installing the Connect IQ app; they should just integrate the Connect app and Connect IQ app together- Doesn't let you enter body fat %; relies on BMI for fitness age- Doesn't sync with common cardio equipment so it doesn't automatically track distance/speed/etc- Floors climbed tracking isn't accurate
626,Curtis S,4,the United States ,29-Jun-21,"Get a screen protector.  Otherwise, fantastic.  (Coming from Samsung Gear Watch)","I'm coming from a Samsung Gear s3 Frontier watch that I have been using for 2.5 years.  The experience on that watch was slowing getting worse.  It was getting very laggy and the battery was starting to die quickly.  It served me well, however.  In my pursuit of a new watch, I almost didn't even look at Garmin.  I was figuring I'd upgrade to a newer Samsung watch.  I'm glad I took the time to research and try a Garmin.I'm a techie and quasi-athlete.  In other words, I like gadgets and cool tech, and I take exercise somewhat seriously.  I'm not a hardcore athlete or daily runner by any means.  I was originally looking heavily at the Garmin Forerunner 740.  It had a lot of cool features and health tracking data for me to nerd over.  One thing I didn't care for was the lack of a touch screen and some health and exercise features were probably overkill for my needs. Enter Venu 2.ProsThe Venu 2, in my opinion, is the perfect balance between a modern smart watch (like a Samsung or an apple watch) and a health tracker.  It has a beautiful, bright color touch screen, and an intuitive user interface.  Coming from the Samsung gear there are two main things that I noticed.  1. ) The weight is significantly lighter on the Garmin.  Noticeably.  2.) The battery life on the Garmin is amazing.  My Samsung needed to be charged every night.  That meant no sleep tracking for me.  It's weird, but awesome to not have to worry about battery for days on end.  It's a game changer in my opinion.  How Garmin pulls that off on a lighter watch, I have no idea.Garmin obviously is one of the best in the business when it comes to health tracking.  I've found to the stats to be pretty accurate.  I have noticed, that exercising on my elliptical, the calories burned is under reported on the watch, but that can be adjusted after the fact in the Garmin Connect app.  Otherwise, health tracking is great. Have respiration and oxygen saturation stats are cool features I didn't have before.  I also like the body battery feature.  On to the app.  The Garmin Connect App is one of the nicest looking health tracking interfaces I've seen.  Samsung health has gotten cluttered and sometimes it's hard to find historical data. The Garmin app interfaces is beautiful and motivating.ConsThe Venu 2 is not without it's faults.  I think it could have a better build quaility, particularly on the glass.  My Samsung after 2.5 years didn't have a scratch on it.  My Venu, scratched on day 1.  I was not pleased.  I have since learned that they do sell screen protectors for the Venu 2 which I would highly recommend.  Also, on Amazon, Asurion insurance is only about 30 bucks which covers screen damage.  Anyway, for $400, I feel like Garmin could use higher quality glass that is more resistant to scratching.  They could also raise the outer bezel just a bit, to make that a more prominent contact point over the screen.  This is where I dock the Venu 2 just 1 star.  I do also wish that Garmin Connect allowed for more third party integration.  My Withings scale for example.  It would be nice if these companies would allow some back and forth with health data.  But I get why they do it.Would I buy it again?  Absolutely.  I love this watch so far.  The weight, the battery life, the interface, the tracking, and the app are all fantastic.  I recommend it with the one caveat of protecting it with a screen protector and possibly insurance."
627,Jonella,4,the United States ,20-Jul-22,Pretty and functional but so-so,"Love the watch overall! Unfortunately came with a scratch on the glass in the box but I had already taken it out and synced it to my phone before I noticed. I’m going to contact Amazon and Garmin about it since it’s sort of annoying to pay so much for a watch and have it be aesthetically damaged from the beginning. It says return unused so not sure how that will work out.I’ve wanted to upgrade from my Charge 3 (Fitbit) for a while now because it still tracked accurately but the screen had went black and I wanted to see heart rate/clock, etc. Garmin has great reviews and I wanted more stats without having to pay for a premium Fitbit subscription monthly. First off, the step count is less than half of what my Fitbit is recording daily (wearing it on my other wrist to compare). Not sure which is more accurate. I’ve heard Fitbit overestimates steps, but I’ve never used a pedometer to check. Surprisingly the sleep amount/times is pretty much the same, although it has very different measurements for REM, deep sleep, etc. compared to Fitbit. I knew when I made the purchase that Garmin’s sleep stats aren’t as in-depth as Fitbit’s but I do appreciate the pulse ox reading setting. Battery life also seems okay. First day playing with it and syncing it to get different apps/activities set up drained it, but I’ve worn it for a few days and it still says 4 days of battery left. I think it will take some getting used to, but I’m excited to wear it to the gym tomorrow and see how it tracks intense exercise. Having bought it on Amazon Prime Day I saved a lot of $$ on the watch so it’s worth it, but for the original $400 I may have considered returning it."
628,Nelson,4,the United States ,2-Mar-22,Amazing features for the pricepoint,"This is my first smartwatch. I came in with my eyes open after watching reviews and sifting through competitor's products, comparing and contrasting. I even made an excel spreadsheet of features, including the price as a barometer of what should be included. What can be hard to quantify is quality, beauty, and usability unless you've actually got your mitts on the product.I am blown away. I thought for $169 I was going to get some half-baked fitbit clone, but this is not. This has an entire online ecosystem that you can use to leverage it's features. Yes, it has sleep tracking (which is not it's best feature), stress monitoring (which is nothing to write home about), body battery (which is quite good), heart rate monitoring (also quite good), and activity monitoring (which I think is its super-power). I think if you are not planning on using its activity tracking while doing some physical activity, this watch is not for you. There are other products out there like an android watch or something.If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive health-tracking device that helps you maintain your exercise and weight, you have come to the right place. The Garmin ecosystem uses a mobile app called Garmin Connect which is indispensable to logging advancements and gains in your fitness regime. They also have an online version which is quite good that uses a customizable dashboard that you can setup to look over your statistics.What I use everyday is the activity tracker which tells me my average heart rate, how many calories I burned, and if running how far I went. It keeps track of your records and congratulates you when you beat them.A game-changer for me was when I started tracking my calories and hydration. The watch doesn't support inputting calories, but it has a ""widget"" you can download for hydration (which is not so good imo). What you can do is connect the Garmin Connect mobile app with a MyFitnessPal account, and easily track your calorie intake. I go into the mobile app and record my meals and water intake which helps me to balance my daily calories and hydration. I bought this watch recently and this has resulted in over 10 lbs weight loss.There is tons of integration with your smartphone, notifications like SMS, emails, and anything else that plops on your phone screen gets ported over. The watch uses the phone to pull in data like weather and any settings you may have changed using the Garmin Connect app. One other thing to note is the Garmin IQ store. You can download apps, widgets, and watch faces, which make the watch much more cool than the default ones.So, all in all there is a lot to offer and I am a proud owner of the Garmin Venu SQ."
629,Fletch,5,the United States ,6-Nov-22,Just what I wanted.  Great features and long battery life.,"If you are reading this, then you are probably going through all of the smart watch/fitness watch/adventure watch options and getting dizzy.  That was me.  After weeks of research, I was down to the Venu 2+ and the Instinct 2 Solar.  And then this Venu 2 (non-plus) went on sale during Prime Day.Moving from a Fitbit Charge 4, any of them would have given me more features, but I was hung up on what the Venu2+ and Instinct 2 Solar offered that this plain old Venu 2 didn't.  However, at the Prime Day price, I could not pass it up.  Now, after owning this watch for a few months, I have forgotten most of what those watches offered above the Venu 2.I primarily run, hike, and play golf with the occasional bike ride or other activity thrown in.  Though I do at least one of those activities 4-5 days a week, I am not a serious participant in any of them and so the truly high end features are not needed.  For what I do, the Venu does it all (well, very nearly all) and does it well.  And, it looks good doing it.  Taking my three primary activities, I'll give you my take:1.  Running.  I was looking for a watch to use while training for a set of races.  Not specific to this watch, the Garmin Connect app and the training programs offered through it were fantastic.  Data screens are nicely configurable and I was able to pair it with my foot pod (for treadmill) and, in the end, managed to beat my race goal time significantly.  The watch was easy to see even in the brightest sunshine and the display was crystal clear.  It's also easy to configure and navigate through. There were only two things that I would have liked but didn't have regarding running:  There is no virtual pace partner (my old Forerunner 620 had that) and you can't send PacePro Pacing Strategies to the Venu 2.  Neither of these are critical, but if I had to add two features, those would be it.Hiking.  The GPS tracking is very accurate and for casual hiking (which is all I do) there is nothing lacking.  Though it does gather elevation info, it does not have the pro hiking features found on Instinct 2, Fenix, etc.  Not a problem for me.Golf.  Now this was my most pleasant surprise.  I had a Garmin Approach watch already and I loved it.  Notice that the previous sentence was in the past tense.  Yeah, I don't use my Approach any more.  The Venu 2 works great as a golf watch and is easier to use.  The only slight negative is that you have to download the courses manually rather than having them all populated in the Approach.  You also have a limited amount of memory available, so you can only download a half dozen or so at once.  Otherwise, I love it for golf.  Note that my Approach watch was not an S60 or S62, so didn't have the most advanced features those have, but, again, I don't need those things as they would only make the rounds even longer.As for other things, I really enjoy:Beautiful OLED displayWatch face customizations for both looks and functionalitySleep tracking (Garmin is brutal about your sleep)Stress trackingBody battery is a great and accurate indicator of how much energy you have leftPhone finder (use it all the time)Fall detection (luckily haven't needed it, yet).Battery life if you don't use GPS is nearly 2 weeks.Syncs flawlessly with my phone, tablet, or computer.Spot on heart rate monitor.Things that could be better:The tracking of elevation without GPS is pretty bad.Bezel is a little rough.Some better apps for navigation would be nice.Tracking of nontraditional movement does not always work ( e.g. using a push mower you don't get steps).Garmin makes literally dozens of different active watches and the Venu 2 is one of them.  That meaningless statement is meant to say that you just need to decide on the features you need and the price you are willing to pay, and Garmin will have a watch for you.  The Venu 2 line of watches are in that area between a fitness watch and a smart watch with some of the best features of both...and you don't have to charge it every 2 days like the true smart watches.It's been funny to see Apple advertising ""new"" features for the latest Apple Watch.  These are features that have been on Garmin watches for years.  I know Apple has its eye on Garmin's market and through their cult-like following will undoubtedly take some share, but as long as Garming keeps innovating, they are going to be among the best watches with the most choices anywhere."
630,Cristine,5,the United States ,8-Nov-22,Love love love Garmin watches!,"This is my 3rd Garmin watch. I have 2 additional Garmin Vivomove 3 watches. One in black and one in white. I am so impressed with Garmin and their line of watches. I dont have an Apple phone and I dont like the Samsung watch style, but once I saw Garmin a few years ago I had to give it a try. This watch is alot different from my other watches, it's digital and looks like an Apple watch, but the commands are alot different. They are more aimed at fitness, which is ok by me. I dont really need to be notified on my watch when I have a like on Instagram or a random email comes in, although I do have that option! You download the Garmin Connect App and sync your watch via Bluetooth. Once you set yourself up an account, you can program which notifications you want and also what health apps you want to use. You cannot make or receive calls on this watch, which is fine with me-you do get notified that you have a call coming in and who it is. And the battery life is amazing, I got 3-4  days on a full charge! This is a great watch without the price that Samsung and Apple charge. And it looks so stylish and unique with anything you wear! I would give it a second look if you are looking for a watch that does what you need and looks great on your wrist!"
631,RobertW,5,the United States ,12-Sep-22,Really Pleased,"My objective hadn't been to buy a smart watch...I'd used a Garmin Vivofit for years to monitor my heart rate while exercising on machines that communicated with it at the gym. However, I wanted to broaden my exercise routine; a broadening that would take me away from the machines. So, the objective was to get a device that would communicate with my Polar chest band while exercising. Objective accomplished; and, BOY, did I ever get much more!Having never worn a smart watch, I'd never paid much attention to them. They'd seemed like just another gadget that I really didn't need. However, now that I have it, I really love the convenience of being able to catch much of what my phone brings me on my wrist.As one who'd used the Gamin android app and website to monitor my exercise regimen for quite awhile, the Venu 2's ready interface with both app and website seemed like a natural fit. I was right about that.At the moment, I'm using it daily to record and log my workout results, and it's a very convenient way of staying on top of communications that are coming into me; both text and email. I also like the little prompts it gives to get moving and breathe deeply when stressed. Moreover, it's something of a comfort when I see it congratulate me for having passed whatever goals it's monitoring for me.The battery life is amazing. I haven't pushed it to its limit, but extrapolating what I see in the way of daily power loss, I'm pretty certain that I'd get well over a week's use before having to plug it in. I also like the easy interface with the Garmin app on my PC when I plug it in. It appears as an additional drive, capable of accepting firmware updates and communication with the app while it recharges.Never one to walk around listening to music, I've not yet loaded my iTunes library into it. Nor do I use it to take phone calls via ear buds. Perhaps I'll start using those features down the road; but, at least for the time being, my phone seems perfectly adequate for that.My wife says that she wishes it had a bit of a slimmer profile, but I don't find it all that different in that respect from many men's watches.All in all, though, I'm very pleased with the Venu 2. It accomplishes exactly what I meant for it to do...and much more!"
632,Amazon Customer,5,the United States ,26-Oct-22,"Excellent Value, Robust Feature Set","I bought the Venu for myself and the Venu Sq for my wife. We looked seriously at smartwatches from from the two leading phone manufacturers (as well as some lesser-known brands) and chose Garmin Venu sq because it has SPO2, is water resistant and it is more cost-effective than the other options. Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase and, if I needed to replace it, I would buy the same watch.The Garmin Connect app was a pleasant surprise in terms of exercise tracking and data management. Coming from another smart device (a dedicated fitness tracker) I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it is. Honestly, I don't miss the other app (or the fitness tracker) at all.Things I like:1) The feature set is excellent2) The battery life is EXCELLENT3) The data this device can collect (especially HR and sleep) is very useful (HR is accurate as compared to a pulse oximeter)4) It is very (and legitimately) water resistant5) Once you understand how it uses data to create a stress level, the stress level function is surprisingly useful and accurateThings that could be improved:1) The bluetooth connection to the phone drops fairly frequently (for some reason, this seems to be a bigger issue with the Venu sq than the Venu)2) SPO2 is not accurate on the Venu sq or the Venu, however, it seems to be off by a consistent interval3) You need two apps to manage this watch - one for data and one for UI (though they work in tandem)4) The initial setup seemed to take a very long time (numerous updates, etc.)"
633,BarrySaukee,5,the United States ,4-Dec-22,Fifth time’s the charm!,"I’ve purchased and used 3 fitbit watches and an Apple Watch - all primarily for tracking daily steps.Fitbit?  The display is consistently a piece of crap.  When I went out in the sun, I simply couldn’t read it at all.  Aside from that?  Meh.Apple Watch for tracking distance?  It has way to much unnecessary and “un-watch” oriented junk on it.Multipurpose works in many scenarios - but an Apple Watch is like a blender combined with a tv set, combined with a toothbrush - or something.Amyway, this Garmin watch is super fantastically amazing.  It’s easy to read, has GPS for tracking my routes, syncs really quickly, and has a bunch of features exclusively focussed on health.Get it!"
634,Grace,5,the United States ,24-Jul-21,Fantastic fitness watch that works fine as a smartwatch too,"I had a Samsung Gear S3 for 3 years before buying this watch. The S3 was a good watch, but so many of the fitness functions were flawed. It had poor GPS tracking so my runs would come out with shortened distances, and even though it had weights and other workouts, I couldn't build a full workout program.After watching many video reviews, I decided to switch to the Garmin Venu 2. The build quality is great and the watch is actually a little slimmer and lighter than the Samsung. I found that Garmin had several different coaching programs so I started one for a 5k. I've been working through it for 2 months now and I'm really enjoying it. It does a great job of pushing me hard enough, but giving me recovery time to get stronger. I haven't been able to run this well in a long time so it's really a great feeling. On top of that, I built my own custom 3 day split for weights. When starting a weight workout, it shows my first exercise, amount of weight, and how many sets and reps. It counts the reps as best it can although some movements don't involve your watch arm so it will be off. You click a button to end the set and it starts the rest countdown that you set up in your program while also giving you a simple menu to adjust the amount of reps and the amount of weight that you did on that set. Tracking the rest time is awesome and keeps me from getting distracted and off pace. It's a fantastic companion for weight lifting and I'm really enjoying having it.The battery life is simply awesome. I'm tracking either weights or a run almost every day and I'm getting 9 days of battery life between charges. My Samsung watch started at about 3 days of battery life and has decreased over time to about a day and a half. It does have a proprietary plug so I have to be careful not to lose the cord. USB C would have been nice, but Garmin has been using this plug for a long time so it is easy to find replacements online.I've paired wireless headphones to the watch (Samsung Buds) and I listen to Spotify. They work great and don't have any drop outs.I'm a big fan of having a lot of complications on my watch face so I can get a lot of information with a quick glance. The default watch faces were just okay, but Garmin has a store with more options. I'm currently using a free one called ""Clear and Powerful"" and I'm obsessed with it. It has a nice clean style while still providing a ton of data (in addition to the time I have date, sunrise/sunset, steps, floors, battery, altitude, temp, and moon cycle).Sleep tracking is great and very accurate. It is useful information and they pair it with a body battery meter that shows how rested and ready for workouts you should be. There are lots of other graphs and tracking that it does for heartbeat, oxygen, and breaths per minute. It's all well laid out and not overwhelming.There are a few small drawbacks. There's no speaker or microphone on the watch so you can't take calls directly from it. You also can't activate an assistant. Besides those specific areas, the watch shows me all of my notifications and I can see and use canned replies to texts. I almost always want to use my phone for any real replies so this is fine for my needs. I did have a few times in the past when I took a call on the Samsung watch. It was convenient, but again, not a deal breaker for me to not have it as I'll answer the call on the Buds or on the phone itself. The watch will still show who is calling and allow me to decline or answer from the watch.So over all, a really great watch. The smart watch features are enough to cover making sure you don't miss calls, texts, and notifications, and provide a lot of data on the watch face. The battery life is amazing and it's really nice to know I could go on a trip and not even have to worry about charging it for the entire time. The running coach is very good and the weights workout creator is easy to use, but very rich in features. Anyone serious about fitness should take a strong look at this watch."
635,Number Six,5,the United States ,11-Jun-22,Works As Advertised - No problems,"This is the 5th smartwatch I've ordered/received in the attempt to replace my June 02, 2019, now 3yr old $41.49 cent Kronoz ZeRound 2 call/receive watch, and finally this GARMIN VENUE 2+ seems to be the device I've been searching for! The other 4 devices which didn't work due to the authorized dedicated app not pairing with my phone or whatever the problem was?!!?  I was surprised I had pairing issues with my Samsung A 52 5G phone for some odd reason.  I was about to give up on replacing the watch when I decided to try the GARMIN VENUE 2+ but with my Xiaomi Poco X3 Pro phone and everything works! The app works, pairing effortlessly. The call/receive function works, the health features work, and the messaging works.  That is all I wanted.I will mention that the other 4 unnamed devices I tried to use with my Samsung smartphone and shuddered to think the phone might've been the problem? The devices may work fine with other phones IDK?!!?  I returned the watches before I thought to even try my Xiaomi Poco smartphone.  [I have nothing against Samsung products at all and use my Tab S7 daily.]I am now using said Xiaomi Poco X3 Pro with the GARMIN watch, and there have been no issues whatsoever. N-O-N-E!!  I have not tried to pair it with the Samsung and will most probably try that sometime in the future, but I'm not eager to do so since the Poco phone works so well with the GARMIN watch as desired.  I don't need all of the Sport Activity functions except for about 3 or 4 of them, as all I truly wanted was to be able to call/receive via Bluetooth, use Heart rate, Sleep, Steps, O2 and other related health functions.I am quite pleased with the GARMIN VENUE 2+ smartwatch but still wonder why I had such difficulty with the other watches.  They ranged in price from $$ to $$$.  So while I paid the most ($463.00) for this GARMIN watch I have no complaints!  Another big plus is the advertised battery-life which also was an ability I wanted on my watch.  Yep, it eliminates up the need to charge it frequently.  I have had no issues with the GARMIN watch nor the Connect app whatsoever. [There was even a Number 6 ""The Prisoner"" watch face!!😊)  I'll update again in September 2022 to report anything pro or con since I've only been using this device for less than 2 weeks.  But it worked right away from the moment I unboxed it, affixed it to my wrist, and never looked back.  I didn't even need to charge it!  Yes, I'm chuffed all around.  Honestly, we ALL just want the ""stuff to work"" the first time and continue to do so without fail, right?  This Venue 2+ provides that for me."
636,Scott,5,the United States ,2-Sep-22,"It's really good, but...","I had it for a couple weeks. Use to track steps, cardio, walks, jogs, gym mostly, but it does so much more. However, after turning off push notifications for certain things I still get them. When you hit a goal like steps, it will alert for each step after not allowing access to anything else unless you stop walking because it gets locked up alerting, but then wait for alerts to stop, then proceed to next function. It's really annoying. I still get voice-mail alerts and phone stuff after turning phone notifications off. Still get others too for social media. Also, it won't track any rep counts for lower body when using strength mode. And when it tracks upper body movements like bench, curls, presses, etc. It won't count all the reps, maybe 7 out of 10, or less sometimes. I like how it tracks my cardio stuff, intensity minutes, heart rate, calories, sleep, etc. Overall, I love it, but it needs some work on the mentioned issues. And I wish it had access to the gym and fitness activity listed in app, but this model doesn't have that feature unfortunately.UPDATE: The issue with the alerts getting stuck was from Samsung health pushing notifications. I turned it off and the issues stopped. I also noticed that the strength training aspect not only doesn't count lower body reps, but when it counts upper body stuff it'll confuse bench with military press, or curls, etc.. So not only does it not count every rep, it counts bench reps and military press or whatever and to change you need to go in and edit each set. I'm not doing it, but that's how you could fix. You can also add the not counted reps and change it to reflect what you're doing, but who wants to do all that! Also hit my intensity minutes and got 500 twice in one day but still never got my Badge! Still love the watch tho."
637,Amazon Customer,5,the United States ,19-Nov-22,Great watch for the price,I've been wearing an inexpensive sports watch for the past 2 years and it had a few functions but THIS is the best watch ever and has a lot of features.  It was a great purchase and I may have to purchase one more as a gift for my girlfriend.  I like that everything is personalized and can't wait to see how it performs in Spin class and other workouts at the gym.
638,Idan Bianco,5,the United States ,2-Dec-22,I just love this watch,"Was a little bit afraid of the size given it's said to be smaller. But since I have a small hand I went for it, and I love it!The battery life for now looks great and the data I get from it is awesome!"
639,Kyle Thompson,1,the United States ,3-Dec-22,No google assistant!?!?!?!?!?,"The first one I received was defective. the screen wouldn't turn on so I had to exchange it for a new one, thankfully Amazon makes that process simple and easy. After getting the new one and setting it I'm I am confronted with a shocking discovery. Fitbit was recently purchased by Google, and I've recently been intrested in the google family of apps specifically Google home and Google assistant. It was my assumption that the versa 4 would be compatible with my Google apps, I was wrong. For some reason even though the versa 2 and 3 are compatible with Google assistant, the versa 4 is not. Make it make sense! Now I am stuck in an awkward position, I dont want to buy the obsolete model of the versa that is Google compatible, but Im not sure I want this one if It isnt Google compatible. Bozo move from Google, dont remove features that allow your products to use your apps."
640,Jimmy Johnson,1,the United States ,28-Sep-22,Major GPS Issues,"I was hoping the GPS would have improved from the versa 3 (the reason I didn't keep the versa 3) but it appears it has gotten much worse.The first test was walking around a 1.75 mile route that I have recorded with my Garmin Venu 2 multiple times. I started in an open field and the watch said GPS was connected. Ten feet later it lost the signal and then during the walk it appeared to disconnect and reconnect several times.  When I looked at the map of my route in the fitbit app (see attached picture) it was just a straight line. What? How does this make any sense? Not only that, but the start and end points were wildly off. Nowhere near the actual locations.I attempted to test a second time in the same starting spot but couldn't get a GPS signal. Keep in mind this is an open field with no obstructions. This is very disappointing.I did a factory reset and tried again but the watch still couldn’t connect to a gps signal after several minutes in an open location."
641,MAS,1,the United States ,6-Dec-22,Huge DOWNGRADE from Versa 2,"I have used the Fitbit Alta HR, the original Versa, and the Versa 2. I mainly like them for the sleep tracking, alarms, step count, and constant heart rate monitor. Even though every single Fitbit I have owned breaks RIGHT after the warranty period, I have still stayed with them because the product is good during the first 2 years. I will not do so after this. I have only had the Versa 4 for a week, and already I hate it. It cannot track my heart rate consistently, and still hasn’t given me a temperature reading. Therefore I cannot use the stress monitor or the sleep data consistently. The tech in this watch is crap and is a huge downgrade from the Versa 2, which I loved. DO NOT BUY."
642,Amy Sandoval,1,the United States ,17-Nov-22,You might as well get a basic non LED fitbit for all the features you don't get with this watch,"I was fooled into thinking this watch was the newest and greatest fitbit watch. My Versa 2 just went caput and I was excited to get the 4. Little did I know that Google got their greedy little hands on Fitbit's software, when they purchased the company, and have completely destroyed a great watch series. From the lack of 3rd party apps, no google assistant, inability to take phone calls, this ""smart watch"" reminds me of Mean Girls. As Gretchen (Versa 3) would say to Caty (Versa 4) ""everybody thinks you're a jungle freak who's a less hot version of ME""All this to say I returned and a warning you, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Get the Versa 3. You've been warned."
643,ThisAsianMom,1,the United States ,5-Dec-22,Does not support Spotify or pandora app,"If you're looking for music control for Spotify or Pandora you're not going to find it on fitbit versa 4. I'm disappointed because I use that feature when working out or working around the house. Versa 4 does not support 3rd party app. A lot of features that I liked on versa 2 is not available on versa 4. I have apple series 7 the battery on that drain fast every 2 days I would have to charge it so I thought versa 4 would be better,  turns out the battery life is better but the app functions is garbage!"
644,Tim,1,the United States ,12-Oct-22,Buy Versa 3. Stay clear of both 4 and Sense 2,"***Update*** I sent my Versa 4 back. Way to many issues. Google is dismanting Fitbit :(Fitbit, you dropped the ball on this one. Somebody should be demoted to the mail room.Lost all kinds of features and it's buggy.No more ability to connect to Wifi. Only way to down load is through your slow BT connection on your phone.No more App down load other than there internal stuff.No more google assistant... Only Alexa.HR monitor is buggy at best.Brightness settings stuck at 1 (one) level. You can't adjust it even though there are menu options.Customer service has no info or ability to help.Google Pixel Watch looks so much better now thanks to this failed launch."
645,Amazon Customer,1,the United States ,2-Dec-22,Broken after 2.5 weeks,"The watch worked and synced well for 2 weeks then it stopped syncing/pairing with bluetooth. I tried all of the steps in the manual to get it to sync but none worked. Unusually optimistic, I threw away the box so rather than return the defective product, I have to pay to send it in.  Very disappointed, Fitbit!"
646,Bailey,1,the United States ,21-Nov-22,WILL NOT SYNC,"If you want to waste over an hour with their customer support to do the same 10 steps over and over, this is the product for you. This would not sync with my phone no matter what I tried.I am returning it and going back to the Versa 3."
647,Amazon Customer,1,the United States ,23-Nov-22,The watch band does not fit,"The band is terrible, it will just barely go around my wrist and cuts into the skin,  now I'll need to order a new watch band when I get home and hope that it fits better"
648,Carolina Girl,1,the United States ,27-Oct-22,it will not stop buzzing for google pay,I wanted a new fitibit to replace my Charge 2.  This is nice but it buzzed every 10 mins and said press the button on the side for Google pay.  I could not make it stop.  So i returned it. I am still searching for a replacement for my Charge 2.
649,Amazon Customer,2,the United States ,31-Oct-22,Why Did Fitbit even Release this?,"I tried the Versa 4 for 2 weeks and sent it back.  I had ordered it because my Versa 3 was unrepairable so I upgraded to Versa 4.  what a joke.  No apps.  Few Clock Faces . They say it will eventually have Google Pay, but is that worth waiting for.  Very disappointed in what should be upgrade. From what I am hearing they want you to buy their New Google watch.  I bought another Versa 3 and it is working good. for less $$$."
650,PANSY,2,the United States ,16-Nov-22,Very disappointed.  I miss my old versa.,The new versa doesn't have all the features of the old one.  No faces to choose from and I actually have to touch the face to get it to light up.  I miss my old versa.
651,Jeff449,2,the United States ,2-Nov-22,Not the upgrade that I was hoping for…,"Much prefer the Versa 3, they dropped features that I liked and added a bunch of stuff that is meaningless to me"
652,Brittney,2,the United States ,13-Oct-22,Fitness Tracker not Smart Watch,"I have been purchasing the Versa and other Fitbit watches for years. I absolutely love their products and was thrilled when the first Versa came out. I have an apple watch too, but always leaned more on my Fitbit as it feels more comfortable, is more customizable, and is overall less convoluted then the stuffy apple watch. All this being said, i jumped on the next release of the Versa 4 without much thought. I looked to see if there were any significant changes, and all seemed good….of course they never mention the lack of music support moving forward. This, of course, is hard to find information on unless you dig into obscure forums online. Lets just say, it didn’t take more then a few workouts and a-lot of confusion, to figure out this key feature was MIA, and I am so disappointed. After 8 years of Fitbit loyalty, i’ll be leaving to another brand. Who would have thought that bluetooth music control would be too difficult to support at a 230$ price point. Good luck to Google and their new Pixels, but ill be looking elsewhere, and selling my Versa 4."
653,Emily Barbour,2,the United States ,21-Nov-22,Earlier versions of the Versa have more features,"I received my Versa 4 this morning (an upgrade from my Versa 2)- and what a disappointment. The Versa 4 no longer supports 3rd party apps like Spotify, Pandora, Starbucks, etc. The flashlight, calendar, and Google assistant capabilities have also been removed. I spoke with several different people from Fitbit Support today, and several of them confirmed that some of the features on the Versa 4 listed as ""coming soon"" are in fact not ever coming. For the slight increase in workout tracking capabilities that came with upgrading from the Versa 2 to the Versa 4, the other aspects of functionality significantly decreased. Don't waste your money."
654,Carolyn E Snyder,2,the United States ,3-Dec-22,Can’t get Fitbit to notify for texts and phone calls. Not happy with this versa4,Loved my old Fitbit Versa. New Fitbit Versa 4 won’t notify of calls or texts. I’ve tried all the tips they have given.  Would Not recommend
655,324Nance,2,the United States ,27-Oct-22,Won’t get iPhone texts. Let down.,"I can get some notifications like calendar updates and alerts, call ringing , but no texts will come through ever.  I have tried all the trouble shooting configurations on the watch, app, and iPhoneHad a similar problem with my charge 2. Sometimes could get texts other times not come though."
656,Ross Smyth,3,the United States ,9-Oct-22,Overall good excecpt the heart rate tracker - which is important,"If someone asked me whether I like this watch or not, I would say that I like it. It is simple and the interface is decent. I do not want a watch that attempts to replace my phone, but rather one that complements it. I think that the Fitbit Versa is a good choice for this. It tells me notifications, tracks sensor telemetry, tracks my physical state, and has decent battery life. These are things that my phone cannot easily do.Other smart watches such as the Samsung Galaxy Watch do too much. I don't really care that I can reply to texts, browse the web, or essentially replace my phone. I always have my phone on or near me. If I am too busy to reply on my phone then I also wouldn't reply on my watch, an only worse experience because they try to cram a full QWERTY keyboard on it.I bought the Fitbit Versa 4 because one of my requirements is that the watch I use has Google Pay on it. It does not at release, but I'm fine with it coming later as it is not an immediate requirement. I also assumed that the fitness tracking on Fitbit would be good because Fitbit is basically the oldest consumer tracker company I know of, so I guessed it probably works well.Comfort - 9/10The strap that it came with is quite comfortable. I do not wear watches, primarily because the ones I have tried were not very comfortable.  This watch and strap is pretty good. I've only had one day tuning the tightness and position where it was uncomfortable and that was my fault as it was too tight. I also like that it is small and light. I mostly forget it is there, and am comfortable sleeping it with.Update Nov. 5th 2022: After about a month of wearing it almost 24/7 I have some irritation. Also if I sleep with it and put weight upon the watch band (the watch face going down in to the bed) I will wake up with a lot of irritation.Interface  - 7/10The interface is mostly intuitive. It is not that clunky as some smart watches I have seen in the past. The main thing I do not like and I didn't quite get at first was that the apps list is found by pressing the button. I didn't know how to use the alarm the first night because of this. But overall it works. It is mostly responsive, but sometimes not if it is rendering many things in the interface. I can forgive this as it is not a super powerful watch. I am happy with this.Battery life- 8/10One of the primary things that I want in a smart watch is a longish battery life. The more general smart watches' battery life is not that great. This one lasts about 3 days with the always on display turned on, which I am happy with. I will try it with the always on display off to see how it lasts. With sleep mode on it drains about 10% battery over 8 hours.Update Nov. 5th 2022: With display not on always-on, then it lasts about 7-9 days depending on how much I exercise.Sleep Tracking - 10/10I am quite impressed with the sleep tracking. I don't have to tell it anything. It just knows that I am sleeping and tracks it. Even random naps that I take in the evening. I do not know the times I fall asleep, but it is always on the exact minute I wake up. Good job on this, and I quite like it. As for the oxygen saturation tracking, I have nothing to compare it against so who knows, it could be made up for all I know.Heart rate - 3/10Oof, this is not good and I am quite disappointed with. During the day at work and home it seems to be fine. This is good for capturing my resting heart rate which I am interested in. But during workouts it is basically useless. I have worked out 3 times with it since I got it, and it is just wildly inaccurate. The only thing it is good for is using the workout timer to count my pulse manually. While doing some spinning in the gym I consistently measure my pulse at 170-180 BPM, but this thing is measuring as low as 90 BPM to 160 BPM, usually ranging in 130-150. I can forgive being off by 10 or so BPM, but this is just wild. Once my heart rate goes about 140 or 150 it just becomes useless. It will vary by 10 BPM each measurement, vibrate warning my heart rate is not in ""the zone."" Well that sucks. I bought this thing specifically so that I could track my workout, hoping because Fitbit is a well known brand that it would do this specific thing well, and it does not.Other -I like the alarm, but I think all watches do something like that. I use the weather occasionally, and the timer is fine. I would prefer that it sets the timer, and allows me to actually start it rather than automatically starting when I lock-in a time, but that a minor gripe. The phone interface is good, and I think that it summarizes the telemetry pretty well. I also like the default watchface, and have not changed it.Update Nov. 5th 2022: I did not realize this before, but the alarm only alarms for like 20 or 30 seconds before turning off. This is fine some times, but other times I need way more effort to wake up. I have no seen a way to configure this. I would prefer that it alarms until I turn it off.ConclusionIf I can find a smart watch that is similar size, as I do like that this one is small and light, I may replace it. Mainly because of the heart rate tracking. But I am very impressed with the sleep tracking, and i like the battery life and comfort so I am going to stick with it for now. I hope that heart rate tracking can be fixed with a software update, because I do want to like this watch."
657,Savannah,3,the United States ,17-Nov-22,Inaccurate heart rate,"I have been using fitbits for years, mainly using the Versa 2 which was great. I had some heart rate issues with that one but after some adjustment, it worked just fine most of the time. I have noticed with this newer version, it isn’t getting the right heart rate information through the majority of my workouts, because that is 90% of the reason I use a Fitbit. The alarm also sometimes doesn’t go off. I woke up 45 minutes late this morning because of that.Customer service isn’t great either, they want me to just send them the device and they’ll send me a new one but I don’t want to be without it while they send me a new one. It also seems other people are having the heart rate issue, so just a new device would not fix that problem."
658,Tim,3,the United States ,28-Oct-22,Stick with the Versa 3,"I had to replace my Versa 3 after a little over a year.  Usually my Fitbit watches last 2-3 years but the Versa 3 went a little early.  I liked the watch but when it's time to upgrade, I usually don't buy an old model when there's something newer out.  Fitbit watches tend to get better, at least in my opinion, with each new iteration but sadly that was not the case here.  I think it's great that the physical button was brought back but the way the notifications come in, the laggy tile scrolling, and the way that, while silicone versa 3 bands are compatible with this watch, so far metal ones are not due to the latch mechanism in the body being longer.  I'm trying to hold out for a firmware update that may fix the software issues, but I'm regretting the upgrade to the Versa 4 so far."
659,stilly,3,the United States ,22-Nov-22,3rd Fitbit I’ve owned and the worst Fitbit,"Not only can you no longer add water intake from the watch, you cannot customize the face, have music, and other features the older models use to have. I’m very disappointed. I also have experienced it freezing (thus having to restart it frequently) and face not working as it should (or like the older models). In fact it skips notifications and is difficult to control on the watch itself. It still does my main goal (steps) and I guess the sleep tracking is nice too."
660,Ballpoint,3,the United States ,11-Oct-22,Missing a lot!,"I had a Versa 2 that I was pretty happy with for the most part. But 2 years in, I experienced screen burn in and opted to get the new Versa 4. With new versions, you expect some new features AND you also expect that features don't go away. Unfortunately 3rd part apps have gone away and FitBit doesn't seem to be developing much. No third party apps means the ""flashlight"" app is no longer available to install. That was really convenient at times. :(  No Google Assistant (which was not in 2, was in 3 and now not in 4). Just dumb. I have to conclude that Google purposely dumbed down the Versa 4 in order to make their new Pixel watch look good. They should have just suspended the old Fitbit products instead."
661,D. Hultsman,3,the United States ,24-Nov-22,Big disappointment compared to the Ionic i wore for three years without a single issue,Good price.  Bad watch band.  Great battery life.  Very good statistics screens but data collection was poor and certainly unreliable.  Never had an issue with previous Fitbit product and in fact the Iconic i wore for three or more years was perfect  I would not have tried this subpar Versa had the Iconic nit been recalled.
662,Denita King,3,the United States ,28-Nov-22,ZONE MINUTES?,"WHATS GOING ON IVE ONLY HAD THIS WATCH GOING ON 2 WEEKS, AND IT STOPPED RECORDING MY ACTIVITY MINUTES OR ZONE MINUTES IS WHAT THEY CALL THEM NOW------HELP"
663,Kindle Customer,3,the United States ,22-Oct-22,step down from the Versa 3,"This version does not buzz when you receive a text or phone call.  It also does not remind you to keep moving.  The clock display is smaller.  Overall, it is not as good as the Versa 3.  I regret buying it."
664,M,3,the United States ,1-Dec-22,Read before buying: No music Control or Apps,"Really great fitness watch, but a lot the other reasons I purchased are actually on the versa 3 and not the 4 for some reason. I can't download apps, and there's no music control. You cannot quick reply with an iphone, no google assistant just Alexa. More than likely returning vs waiting waiting on Fitbit to ""consider"" adding features."
665,gwg,3,the United States ,1-Dec-22,New to fitbit.  Comparing to Garmin..,"The most important difference to me is the watchface design.  My Garmin got caught on everything,  and I mean everything!!  The fitbit design is a lower profile with round edges."
666,Samuel,4,the United States ,5-Dec-22,It’s a great all around watch,"It’s sleep tracking is very good and detailed, the premium based app in my opinion is ok but you’re missing a lot of features on the base non-payed version the heart tracking is fair but could use some updates with the software for it and the band it comes with feels alright but whatever it’s made of is very irritating to the sensitive wrist skin so I’d recommend buying a 3rd party band when getting this watch but all in all it’s functional but one key thing to note with this watch is if you’re a music person you can forget it this watch has no music capabilities at all"
667,Amz4me,4,the United States ,3-Dec-22,Versa 4 is Awesome!,I like that it tells me what I want to monitor on the display screen. With the screen on I do have to charge more. That is a downside.  I like that you can upgrade I started with a Charge then a Charge 4 and now a Versa 4.
668,Sassmo,4,the United States ,29-Nov-22,Good not perfect fitness tracker for money,Won’t track temperature or O2 levels except through night time and mine doesn’t seem to track night time measurements at all. says wear for three nights but still doesn’t track after three weeks. Nice looking and comfortable. Battery life good.
669,lauriefl777,4,the United States ,27-Nov-22,Relatively happy,"I love the watch but HATE the band!!!  You have to tuck it between the band and your skin, a terrible design.  I am having no luck finding a normal/replacement band on Amazon."
670,Emily knapp,4,the United States ,4-Dec-22,Bands.,The band is a little abrasive on the skin.
671,OP,4,the United States ,3-Nov-22,"Long battery life, accurate BPM, but a few connectivity glitches","Really like the long battery life and how accurate the fitness tracker is. There seems to be a few connectivity issues with the app that are relatively annoying. It often does not automatically sync, and the phone sync function seems to turn on and off at random. Still, I think Fitbit is the best option as far as battery life and fitness tracking."
672,Dinah LaRoche,4,the United States ,25-Nov-22,Does was it says it does.,Good smart watch .
673,Shay,4,the United States ,1-Nov-22,Good watch for needs,Doesn't do quite as much as my galaxy 5 but it's easy to use and sufficient for what I need
674,Jamie,4,the United States ,2-Nov-22,Does what it's supposed to do.,"It does what it's supposed to do. I feel like it's a superior tracker compared to other smart watches. I love the app and the info you get from it. It really is motivating. The one thing I dislike about it is that the clock faces are lame. The other smart watch I had, had beautiful options for clock faces, for free. The problem with that watch was accuracy and the ability to track info over time. It didn't have a supporting app like fitbit, which is why I went back to fitbit.Far as fitbit goes, even the paid clock faces are rather lame and unappealing. Overall, I'd pick this watch over others due to the app and the ability to track progress over time, despite the clock faces being crappy."
675,mayhap,4,the United States ,16-Oct-22,Good upgrade from my og versa,"I bought this from fitbit direct. So far I have 0 issues with it. The battery life is great! 7 days and I was at 30% when i charged it. I love that it can track so much, and I don't have to worry about taking a shower or going in the hot tub with it.The sleep tracking is very accurate.It has the ability to see all your phone notifications.It still has fitbit pay.I dislike that the bands are limited. I still am looking for a velcro one that actually works with this. There's allot of vendors that say it does but doesn't."
676,Slssij,5,the United States ,19-Nov-22,Great so far!,"My Versa 4 was only at 36% battery upon delivery. Have to chathe to at least 50% to set up.Have had for 3 days. Charged fully Wed pm. Wore Thurs am to Sat am. Battery was at 36%. Probably would've lasted the rest of the day. Took about 15 min to charge fully.I get notifications from about 4 apps, answer phone calls, did a quick reply, Always On Display turned on. No exercise done, so didn't use battery for that. Tracked steps, stairs, sleep, heart rate very well as far as I can see.I ordered screen protector pack, but was 2 days w/o & no scratches on screen.Still learning the app, etc, but am happy w/ my purchase! There are hardly any extra watch faces available. Most say ""Not Available"" or ""Not Optimized for Use"". Did find the one shown for free.$80 off is a good deal! Still looking for an EMF protector to use for this watch."
677,KaraCupcake,5,the United States ,1-Dec-22,Loving it so far!,Got this for the sleep tracking and I’m loving it. I’m so excited to see my sleep score in the morning and it points out that I need to go to bed earlier and I fall asleep pretty quickly. I also got the face that gives me a sleep animal after two weeks. I am very pleased with the resting heart rate and steps counter. I’ll review further when I get more info. I mostly got this because it gives the best sleep stats on the app and it hasn’t disappointed.
678,Mikeyt1818,5,the United States ,15-Nov-22,Great tracker with amazing health insights,"This is my 4th Fitbit. I have had every Versa and I love this one. It is so solid that I got my brother one, he is a first time fitness tracker user and he is impressed. I use my Fitbit to track steps, reply to texts and keep a close eye on my Heart Rate as I suffer from Tachycardia. I love that you get 4-5 days of battery life with 24/7 HR tracking and it is always on the money or within 1-4 ticks of my blood pressure monitor HR results.If you need apps you are better off with the Pixel Watch but for great connection to your phone (especially Android) and the most insightful sleep tracking app and health metrics data you will be hard pressed to find anything as user friendly and cost effective as the Fitbit Versa 4 imho."
679,Aubrey,5,the United States ,4-Dec-22,Very customizable!,"I am really enjoying how customizable the watch is like notifications, what I want to track and the goals I set. It doesn't have as much app integration as some of the other models, but if you're looking for mostly fitness tracking with some push notifications this is a good option."
680,MARK S. TRUMBLE,5,the United States ,1-Dec-22,Good for keeping track of my health,"Like the features, n the fact its water resistant cause I forget to take it off b4 washing my hands. Lil hard to check heart rate when wearing wrkout gloves while lifting weights. Waitin for them to establish the feature of answering calls or texts too."
681,Josie Colon,5,the United States ,30-Nov-22,Feeling complete,I had the Inspire before which I loved (dog chewed it when charging). Now I purchased the Versa 4. LOVE!!!!! I use the sleep tracking most. Mobile App is full of info and I'm still learning. I need everything it has to offer. Battery life is GREAT!
682,Family Readers,5,the United States ,2-Dec-22,Love the sleep track option.,This is my 2nd Versa and it is still my favorite!I love the slightly larger screen. It’s easier on my eyes.Battery life is very good too. I would buy it again.
683,Matt,5,the United States ,6-Dec-22,my wife loves her fitbit,"its motivating.. went from 10,000 steps to 20,000-30,000 / day. didnt want a watch that was a computer just a good sleep tracker and exercise tracker. works great"
684,Alex Langseth,5,the United States ,1-Dec-22,Great product,Wonderful product my only complaint is that it doesn’t track the skin temperature very well not sure if it’s the watch or the app but does a great job and is in fact waterproof!
685,Pamela Williams,5,the United States ,27-Nov-22,great,"would like a apple watch, but the versa 4 basically does the same thing and the battery lasts5 to 6 days, whereas the apple watch lasts one day ?????"
686,dbp,1,the United States ,27-Jan-22,WOULD RETURN BUT.... UPDATED REVIEW,"****UPDATED REVIEW****So I am about a week or so from the last review.ONE cool thing I will note is that (at least on iPhone) there are widgets you can place on your phone screentop.I left off the last review on 1/27 with 57% battery, recently charge on 1/25.Battery died on 1/29, I charged it on 1/30. Wore my iWatch on 1/30 and 1/31.Put the Amazefit Band on 2/1.  It's 2/3 (8am) I am at 51%.As I've mentioned previously aside from the original charge, I've had to sync up with the app every time for all the feature to work/work properly.  This is highly annoying.The last 2 charging times, the band is not syncing or remaining synced.For example it's telling me it's 60/64 degree's and sunny, sorry its 43 degree's (65/40) and raining.Or it's told me I haven't walked at all - literally 0 (ZERO) steps today - I've been up wrangling kids for the bus since 5am.  Three hours I haven't taken a single step?  When did I learn to fly?  My iPhone pedometer which hasn't even been on my person the whole time, has registered 218 steps.I have to open the app and swipe the sync for it to sync, it doesn't automatically do it.It's literally just NOT functioning in the basic capacity.And I'm about 3 days out of the return window.....of course.Guess my kids just got a new toy.Back to the have to charge every night iWatch.  At least I can answer calls on it, and it has a calculator and memo recorder.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Has everything you want, maybe more so.  Lacks accuracy.(Review is in compared to an iWatch.)The main reason I wanted a watch/band is: a watch, a pedometer, a rudimentary fitness tracker (including walking, treadmill, cardio and swimming), a sleep tracker (including duration, REM, # of times awaken during the night, and quality) & continuous heart rate monitor.  The stress monitor would be a plus, but only useful if the information is recorded.  And of course - and LONG battery life.Compared to the iWatch/iPhone technology, the AmazeFit Band 5 isWatch - Hello it's a watch - they both probably pull time from the NIST.Pedometer - Well not only did I measure the iWatch, the AmazeFit Band 5, the Xaomi Mi Band 6, the Garmin VivoActive 4S, and my Treadmill (ReeBok GT40x).  I reviewed both steps and mileage.  They were all wildly different.  I ultimately chose the AmazeFit because it was the closest to meeting the treadmills numbers.However, after about 4 weeks, this band has become quite different than the treadmill.  Almost 1/2mile to 3/4mile off from the treadmill.  After each workout the band does let me calibrate the workout, and some times I can ""match"" it up to the mileage I did on the treadmill - but oftentimes I cannot match the total workout, which for me is very annoying.  I didn't do all of that for nothing.* I am unaware of whether that only affects my ""workout"" mileage, or if it affects my daily step total also.  I have not been able to see a correlation to daily steps - since that continues on through the day after my workout.  (And the treadmill doesn't tell me steps, of course)** One other thing to note about the pedometer while in ""workout"" mode that really bothers me is that, if I am not CONTINUOUSLY swinging my arm it will go in to ""PAUSE"" mode and stop registering my movement.  And I DO MEAN CONTINUOUSLY.  Like if I literally just not swing my arm or if I take a sip of water or brush my hair out of my face I have use the hand that doesn't have the band or it will ""PAUSE"".  That is very annoying.*** I have not had a chance to use it in the pool yet, so I cannot attest to its stroke counting or water durability.Rudimentary Fitness Tracker - I personally do not enjoy the presentation of the information in the APP.(I do not particularly enjoy it in iHealth either)Sleep Tracker - Again, the presentation in the APP is not ideal.  I understand there are a lot of tid-bits presented.  However, if you don't look at it each day, you are unable to view some pieces of information, such as REM, Times awake, Amount of Deep Sleep or Light Sleep.  You can see they are there - just not the individual data.  Which makes it redundant.  When you select the date it only tells you the total amount of sleep for that day.Continuous Heart Rate Monitoring - As similar with other reports - if you don't check it that day and get whatever information you need, you wont be able to access.  For today only, you can see what time your heart rate was at ""xyz,"" - but yesterday or any day prior you will only see the lowest and highest readings, with no timestamps.  There are no alerts for spikes or dips either.Stress Monitor - I can manually run it on my band, but the APP doesn't recognize it.  The last registered reading was 1/1/22.Battery Life - Finally the MAIN Reason I chose this, and did not continue on with my old iWatch.  In late December it had a 15 day battery life.* You have to reconnect with the APP after each charge or some functions will not work, or sync back to the APP.My iWatch had buckled down to about 18hours of battery charge, which was useless to me and with it's pedometer seemingly unfixable with every re-calibration trick tried, I was ready to move on.  This was approximately $40, it had a ""15day"" battery life, it was the closest pedometer accuracy I could find and the app wasn't terrible.  As of late January, 4 weeks later - I have had to charge this band 3 times.Charged when received 12/28wore AmazeFit Band 12/29 - 1/13, (14 days)charged 1/14, wore the iWatch.wore AmazeFit Band 1/15-1/24,  (10 days)charged 1/25, wore the iWatch.1/26-  (2 days and at 57% currently).* It does NOT take all day to charge, I just did not want to interrupt my step count once the day started by change watches midday.** I do not know, nor assume that it is a trend, that the battery life will continue to drop.  It's only been 2 charges post full usage, so a lot of factors go in to that.  I let the battery drain completely down, because I understand that it the best way to preserve the battery.  If this is a significant trend I will update.Conclusion:As most people say - it's a good watch for $40.  Don't expect an iWatch or a Garmin.  Don't ever expect to compare a $40 item to a $300 item.  That said if you're frustrated with the APP or interfaces of iPhone or Garmin or Samsung and want something more straight forward this could work.  Or if your resigned to not be fully on board with anything/everything, then you'll be happier to pay less at less for a fully functional (in the overall sense) product such as this than paying gobbloads for Apple, Garmin, Samsung, etc.  I will say this - I do like the construction of this product.  I don't feel like I need to buy a protective layer for it or worry about my clumsiness.  It's hearty and fits well on my wrist without being too bulky."
687,N. Bond,1,the United States ,4-Oct-20,Very disappointing,"I started with a similar name brand fitness band that died after just 14 months of use.  I originally wanted the similar band from a sister company, but held out because of the promise of a blood oxygen meter. Sadly, after 10 days of use, this Amazfit band has disappointed me in so many ways that I returned it. Here are my thoughts:Blood oxygen meter - I was under the impression that this feature would periodically test O2 levels in the blood during the day, while sleeping, and while exercising.  Instead, the feature must be manually triggered, so no sleep monitoring.  Also, while working out you have to exit out of monitoring the exercise and manually ask for a reading. The band could not take a reading on about a third of my attempts.Display - One great frustration with my former band was that it was unreadable in sunlight. The Amazfit screen is better in that it is barely readable in sunlight. That is, if you can read the tiny print size (there is no option for a larger font).  Watch faces cannot be that hard to program, yet Amazfit only has a small selection, and every one has the time prominent on the face while fitness feedback data is minimalized or not there.  This is a fitness band, at least one available face should emphasize heart rate and distance/steps so that the user has immediate feedback during the workout.  Also, you have to constantly tap the screen button, there is no ""always on"" option that I could find, the ""flip the wrist"" option does not work, and the longest screen time is 10 seconds.Band - The band is difficult to attach and even more difficult to get tight. It is not a traditional watch band, but instead uses a button.Sleep monitoring - Never worked for me, and it was an important feature to me.  Half the time it recorded no sleep at all, other nights it would record about 3 hours when I slept for 8.  Consistently, when it did record sleep, it would cut off sleep time for the night whenever I briefly awoke to use the restroom.Heart rate monitoring - Most disappointing of all.  Works less than half of the time. Often, it says to adjust band. I have tried the band adjusted loose, firm, and so tight that it dented my arm, but all with the same result - hours and hours of no readings. This is probably why the sleep monitoring does not work.  The band has never given me a resting heart rate in the app, a key indicator of health.Alexa app - Works great, but why?  It will only work if band is in range of your smart phone, and by the time you go through all the steps to use the feature on your band you could have pulled the phone out of your pocket and summoned Alexa. The band has no speaker, so there is no voice confirmation of commands, no reply to questions, no music to play.Weather - This feature works great.Battery life - Great, perhaps too good.  Perhaps engineering made too many compromises in features just to squeeze out a little more battery life.  Dear Amazfit - We don't mind charging the band every few days.Amazfit's Zepp app - It's usable, but somewhat clunky.  Some measurements can be converted to Imperial, but some are only available in metric.Smart phone sync with calendar, notifications, etc. - I did not set these up, so no comment."
688,Amanda P.,1,the United States ,10-Oct-22,Defective band doesn't hold a charge.,"Here's the short: First two days I was silly enough to think it was maybe normal to have to charge every few hours (you get what you pay for?)Then I got a chance to compare to an identical band.  So I left BAND A (defective) to charge over night and popped on a brand new also fresh out of the box BAND B with the full bells and whistles enabled: HR and sleep tracking: yep, crank em up.Woke up and unplugged BAND A, took a peek at BAND B and the battery has hardly budged.  Huh.  Cool?Go about my day and periodically compare battery life.  BAND A just keep dropping it's charge while just laying on the table.  BAND B, well that's still going strong and hasn't needed a charge yet.Haven't sorted a way to contact the seller here directly to replace just yet.As for my review of the actual working band and corresponding app:. LOVE IT, and not just for the super affordable price point.  It's customizable to a degree: there are ~50 different ""watch faces""/themes you can use which is nice if some are hard on your eyes or show info you just don't want or care about.  I can't vouch for it's accuracy for caloric burn as I don't use that function at all.Two perks that really stand out for me is that you can actually adjust your music from the band itself.  It's really quite nice to be able to skip to the next song (or back, or pause/stop/adjust volume when your phone is across the room (or whatever speaker your phone is connected to) least of all for YT music - The other bands I've seen with this capability only apply to Spotify and that is IT.Secondly, this thing makes it pretty easy to strack specific workouts/sets directly from the band.  EXTRA PERK: IT ACCURATELY TRACKS ROWING.  I have a home rowing machine and it's reaaaaly nice to not only see how long I've been rowing but also how many strokes.Overall pretty nice band for a very nice price.  Additional ""fun"" bands are pretty cheaply sold here as well along with protective screens for the band face.  I've gotten both already and everything fits perfectly.TL;DR: QC is lacking as I got a defunct band, but otherwise is a pretty great band.Will update if seller reaches out or rectifies, otherwise will refund through Amazon."
689,Lisa Schermerhorn,1,the United States ,19-Apr-21,Super Disappointed,"Edit 4/25/2021:On 4/24 I went walking with some friends; we walked approximately 1.5 miles.  We wrote down what our starting tracker numbers were.  At the end of the walk everyone else's trackers tracked between 2259 and 2296 steps.  My Amazfit had tracked a whooping 102 steps.  On the ride in the car back to the house, my Amazfit tracked me as taking 59 steps.  :-(Needless to say, the Amazfit is going back.  I have ordered a Fitbit Charge 4, as having only Fitbit trackers, I know they are reliable.  I will be sticking to Fitbit trackers in the future.***************************Was super excited to order and get this tracker.  It came when it was supposed to.  I took it out of the package and charged it fully.  I put it on last Wednesday evening before going to bed.The first thing I noticed about it on Thursday evening was that my steps were very low, so low that on Friday morning I put on the tracker that I had been wearing to compare.  I also turned on the steps app on my phone.  I have done all three devices over the weekend and all day today, Monday, and this tracker, at the end of every day, has been more than 3500 steps different than the other two.  I know that all trackers are different and will not measure the same, but more than 3500 steps different is not acceptable.I really like the sleep tracker.  It gives a lot of useful information.  Compared to my old tracker, the times are within 5 minutes of each other, so that seems okay.Battery life is a joke.  They say two weeks battery life; my died after not quite 5 days (Wednesday evening @ about 7:00 to Monday afternoon at about 3:00 until it was completely dead.  Apparently, if you turn on any of the features that it has, heart rate monitoring, it substantially reduces the battery life.  The only  extra thing I turned on was the heart rate monitoring.  I do not play music, hook up or use it as a phone, or any of the many other things you can do with it.  I only used it as a step tracker, sleep monitor, and heart rate monitor.  (After a second 5 days passed, once again, I had to recharge it as it was at 3%).I could live with the short battery life if the step tracker was even remotely correct, but more than 3500 steps off every day is not acceptable to me.  Super disappointed because there are a lot of nice features about this tracker.One of my collogues also bought one of these:  She is how I found out about the tracker in the first place.  She has found that, like mine, her's is also completely off in the step tracking.  She too spent several days with two trackers attached to her arm.We are both very disappointed.  Back to the name brand trackers."
690,Vanessa Williams,1,the United States ,11-Jan-22,Not worth the money or many inaccuracies,"Update January 20, 2022: The band disconnects from my phone overnight, only found this out through the smart lock feature on my phone. There is no customer support. I had it set up to check my heart rate throughout the day every 30 minutes, it does not do that. This band advertises many things but only does a few. It's really only good for the time and step counter.I'll start by recommending your band be worn on the inner wrist, it's a bit more accurate.+comfortable, even when I rest my head on a bent wrist+can partially control my music (only works when music is already playing, won't open music apps)+shows weather+can customize vibrations for alerts+the step counter is pretty accurate+decent battery life/fast charging+there are so many options to explore within the app+bright enough in the winter sun...summer tbd-heart rate is too often completely inaccurate when set up to auto monitor (manual readings, when they choose to read are mostly accurate)-can barely walk 15 feet away from phone before it disconnects (does the same disconnect when I'm sleep right next to my phone)-zero customer service but why expect anything more from China-sleep monitoring has gaps-the math is off because in the last picture you see I did over 10,000 steps during my walk, yet the app/band equated that to just over a mile (it's suppose to be a little over 4mi) and I definitely burned more than 0 calories-the band doesn't realize when I wake up, even after I've been moving around and fiddling on my phone-no continuous blood oxygen reading and to do it or the stress manually, is finicky-in the shower it constantly unlocks because it's so sensitive and before I know it, my settings have been changed and an alarm has been set if I don't pay attention-how they got away with using the likeness of Amazon's name is beyond meOverall, this band okay. Doubt it last a year or longterm. I had a miband but the screen went black and of course, zero customer service and they claimed the band wasn't sold in America. I've never left this country nor did I buy the band, I got it during a clinical trial. Point is, it was their product they chose not to stand by. Unlike most people, I read the TOE and privacy requirements, I recommend everyone do the same because they give whatever info you give them to third parties along with the data in the app. I don't use social media but they take that as well. I don't care if they know how many steps I take or how long I sleep because neither are totally accurate anyway."
691,Patrick The Unsaved,1,the United States ,19-Jan-22,BEWARE! Chinese Company Possibly Hacking Your Phone,"**UPDATE 2: One other thing I noticed when I started using this device and it’s Zepp app was how strange my iPhone and iPad started working once the app was added.  My web browsers and even my Amazon app all started working incredible laggy and strange and even freezing up on me.  At one point I couldn’t even shut off my iPad or close the Amazon app to return to my iPad desktop.  This never happened before I started using the Zepp app.  I can’t say for certain if this app was hacking my devices, but it seems very suspicious that right after I installed a China-based company’s app onto my devices, all these strange things started happening.  Don’t trust this company or it’s devices.*Update: I’m done with this cheap tracker and will be returning it.  Too many connection issues and its crummy app has made this a frustrating purchase.  What was really disturbing was when I went to unpair it frommy phone, it remained connected and started causing my phone to try using it as a speaker, even though the Amazfit has no speaker.  I had to go into the Zepp app and unpair it from there in order to disconnect from my phone.  This was a little too suspicious to me.I also don’t like how this company named it “Amazfit”, as if it were directly associated to Amazon.  That’s also a little misleading, because I actually thought it was an Amazon product.I bought this to replace my FitBit Alta, and since it was under $40, I thought I was getting a bargain.  Based on the reviews, it sounded like I was getting a top notch product, unfortunately it is not.  You really do get what you pay for.  The biggest problem I have is with the Zepp App and it’s confusing interface and inability to allow you to customize the home page layout.  There are only four main things I want to track at a glance, Steps, Distance, Calories and Minutes.  I could care less about PAE (I don’t even know what that is), and yet it’s front and center on the app home page.  Also,  I’m concerned and unhappy about how it added itself as an unknown offline device into my Alexa app.  All of the sudden I have a new device listed under Alexa devices called a “YORK”, which wasn’t there until I paired my Amazfit.  That’s very troubling.  It has also had trouble connecting to its app and has trouble linking to Alexa.  Before I return it, I will try giving this a couple more trial days, but so far I’m very disappointed."
692,Smoothy McSmoothyton,1,the United States ,21-Jul-22,DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! DUMPSTER FIRE WARNING!!,"Buyer Beware: I should have read the most recent reviews instead of the most relevant. I would have stayed far far away and invested in a quality product. This tracker must be made of recycled garbage cans because after 3 months it turns to trash. It all started out well I felt it was a good quality product for the price. So much so that I was even researching buying additional products from this company. Boy, am I glad I didn’t! About 2.5 months in I started to see wild fluctuations in my calorie burn & heart rate. My daily walk which is about a mile I would get 60 cals burned Monday and 250 cals for the same walk on Tuesday. No change in pace or distance. I would also sprint at full speed for a mile, and it would show the lowest possible heart rate even though I was near death. Other days it would match my heart rate monitor I had strapped around my chest. I finally got frustrated enough to reach out to their customer service team as I felt it was possibly just a faulty tracker and was hoping they would replace the item under their 1-year warranty. I went through the prompts and answered all their questions. It said I should hear back within 2 days. Well 2 days came and went without a word. I found a support email online in which I did get a response the following day. The individual’s name was Joey who emailed me. He said the difference in data is due to the difference in the calorie calculations algorithms and the data is accurate given the limitations of their data. Bear in mind that prior to me noticing the issue my caloric burn for my routine exercises were near identical daily. I responded that it was only recently that I was experiencing the swings in data, and I felt there was something wrong with the actual tracker I was wearing. I didn’t receive a response after that from their customer service team.  So basically, this tracker is going into the trash in which it was created. Do yourself a favor and keep looking for an alternative product, don’t buy from this company, save yourself the frustration and disappointment in which I experienced."
693,Skiboots123,1,the United States ,25-Nov-22,Disappointed and surprised,"I was at first excited to receive the new amazfit and had heard good things, but found myself quickly disappointed and frustrated within an initial 2 weeks, enough that I returned it.  The band did not fit my wrist or stay connected.  So, I was losing connection for tracking sleep and activity frequently.  I tried to still 'manage' with the device as I was really hopeful for it to work out.  The app was not easy to download and then follow.  It glitched a bit and took a couple days to really figure it out.  But, then the worst thing and deal breaker happened.  I tried to use the device to track a workout on the treadmill and the device locked into some sort of mode and I couldn't even get it back to the watch face.  The band literally got stuck and I couldn't go back, forward or out of the sport mode, and I was stuck in a screen that my only option was to lock/unlock and it would revert back on it's own, making it impossible to get to any other screen or out of the mode.  very, very disappointed and won't buy another amazfit, even though I really thought that it was going to be the device for me."
694,GreyFrey,1,the United States ,7-Dec-21,"Used, defective device with a tricky return policy - beware","Update 2: I went through the return process for this item. I hadn't noticed, but this product can only be returned if it is defective/damaged. So, beware if you're buying this and think you might just change your mind. I had to go through Support who tried to do technical troubleshooting with me on turning the device on, even though I had already told them that I had been successfully using it at the gym. Then they offered me a $10 compensation and I keep the item, because it was a used device. I turned it down, and asked to return the item for a full refund. Support was very nice, but they obviously had to go through steps before they could authorize the refund. In the end, I got a return-less refund. They may just not want it back because it is such a busy shopping season and it takes too much work to re-shelf?Update: I used the fitness tracker at the gym and it only picked up half of my heart beats while I was lightly jogging, despite re-positioning several times. The battery dropped to 82% by the end of the day. There is no way that this battery would last the full 15 days advertised.Initial review: So... I apparently got a used, defective (battery) knockoff.I charged the device overnight and it dropped to 94% within 10 minutes of being unplugged. Red flag number one - this is probably a used, previously-returned device with an old battery. Well great.During set up, it prompted me to reformat the device and clear all previous data, suggesting it probably had had a previous owner. Red flag number two.I went online to get some tips on how to set up and get the best out of the device and, lo and behold, it turns out that there are two very similar trackers, the Amazfit and the Xiaomi. The interfaces are slightly different, but it was immediately clear that I was sent the Xiaomi, instead of what I had ordered. Red flag number three. It turns out that the Amazfit, which I ordered from the ""Amazfit Store"" seller, is a superior product with greater functionality (for instance, 3 sleep phases instead of 2) and customizable modules on the interface, etc. So not only was I sent a different product, it is an inferior version of what I ordered."
695,NanaZ,1,the United States ,21-May-22,I really wanted to like this but..,"I have had mi bands for the past 7 years with no problems whatsoever.  Each time I upgraded, I  gave my old one, still working, to someone that wanted one but couldn't afford it. My current one is a MI band 3. When the app changed from mifit to Zeplife everything was seamless.  I saw the Amazefit band, made by the same manufacturer as the mi band but with a few more options, I thought I would have the same experience as I had with mifit. Boy, was I wrong.The Amazefit band arrived and I unpacked it and put it on the charger. I absolutely love the charger because the device doesn't have to be removed from the wristband.  But alas, that is the only thing I could love about it because it wouldn't pair with my phone. The app couldn't find the band except one time, but the device wouldn't vibrate and show the screen to tap to finish pairing.  I searched online for every possible fix and tried them all, but to no avail.  The band was a dud, I thought, so I set up a return and replacement.  The return was easy, just taking the band, in the original mfr packaging, to Kohls, showing the return qr code, and it was done.My new Amazefit band arrived the next day. I was excited because surely this one would work. Nope. The app did find this band several times, but again the band didn't vibrate or go to the screen that I was supposed to tap to complete the pairing. This time I called customer service to see if they could help. Although the rep was very nice and wanted to help figure this out, she couldn't.  She even went so far as calling the mfr for help, but they didn’t answer the phone. So much for mfr support!So I'm sending this one back and may not ever buy an Amazefit anything again."
696,FernandoE,2,the United States ,4-Jun-21,Colorful display but not accurate. Mobile app need a lot of work.,"I initially bought this fitness tracker for my 8 year-old son, who had been asking for one, since my wife has an Apple Watch and I wear a FitBit. The product description doesn’t say anything about being made with kids in mind, but some reviewers in the Q&A section said it would fit ok. Based on those comments, I ordered one. My child is on the slim side, and despite wearing the tracker in the tightest hole of the wrist band, it was still too loose for him. So, I decided to try it myself for a couple of days and compare it against an old FitBit Charge 2, and the most recent FitBit Charge 4.On the positive side, the Amazfit Band 5 is cheaper than a FitBit and has a colorful, bright and very responsive screen, so it makes up for a nice and discrete watch. However, I was mostly interested on its tracking capabilities, and this is where I found the problems. In my experience, it was definitely not as accurate as neither of the 2 FitBit trackers I have. The most noticeable metric where I could see this was on the steps that I took. While FitBit tracked them correctly, the Amazfit tracker was simply not counting all of them, even after swinging my arms way more that I usually do when walking.Another issue I had was with the rubber band that comes with this tracker. It is too smooth when trying to put it on, so it sort of keeps sliding out of the loop hole while you’re trying to snap it with one hand. The snap at the end of the band is OK, but it doesn’t feel too secure. I could see it unsnapping by accident in winter, while wearing a shirt, jacket, gloves and other items that rub against my wrist. If you have finger mobility issues, like arthritis, I would not recommend this tracker since snapping the wrist band is going to be a problem for you.One thing people don’t mention is that these types of trackers become more useful and reveal their insights through the companion mobile apps. And this is where Amazfit is miles behind what you get from FitBit. The app you need to use for this tracker is called “Zepp”. While you can put it on an iPhone or an iPad, you can not install it on an Android tablet. As I mentioned before, this tracker was originally purchased for my child, and he wanted to see his metrics on the tablet he uses daily for his school and to play video games. That one is his personal mobile device, since he’s too young for a phone. Being unable to install mobile app on his tablet what was made him decide he no longer wanted this particular fitness tracker. Even if the wrist band could fit, he would not be able to track and see his constant progress. I assume you can probably install the Zepp app on an Android phone (we don’t have one, so I couldn’t test that), but definitely can not on an Android tablet. Perhaps if you side-load it or bypass the Google Play store settings you may succeed on this, but we just wanted to do it via the official way of installing apps.I was able to test the app on my iPhone, and I have to say, it is not polished at all. The way the information is presented, and the way settings are organized is not great. It’s not designed in a way that makes you want to go back periodically to see your progress. Also, it makes you wonder what was the quality control for the app, since some sentences have a very strange and robotic phrasing. Smaller details, like punctuation and spacing, make you feel like the app was rushed out of the door, just to say “we also have a mobile app”.Bottom line is, if you want a cheap and colorful watch, that gives you some metrics about your activity, go with this one. But, for a good tracking device, that gives you info that later you can use to improve your lifestyle, go with a more established brand or product."
697,Amazon Customer,2,the United States ,23-Aug-22,Useability is Poor,"i have ordered several relatively inexpensive smart watches, health & workout variety. My first issue is with the display/watch face.  The data items of most interest to me are heart rate and SPO2.  The heart rate is shown in very small red print in most displays.  Between 10 & 15 % of males see red very poorly.  On this item, the best of three I have briefly owned, their was one of many available displays, that used white numbers, which I could read, but indoors only.  Outdoors, in light, impossible. I did not see a display with the option to show SPO2, likely because you must remain unmoving for 30 or 45 seconds, ie it is not available while moving or working out.  On the other hand, data items such as the date are always displayed in very large characters, taking most of the available display.  I cannot believe that most customers would place a premium on being able to see say heart rate as opposed to date.  Then, there are other symbols on the display that are not explained anywhere I could find, and whose meaning remains a total  mystery to me.  Temperature I could figure out.  A rain cloud I could also figure out, but what the little numbers appearing their referred to, who knows.  Other symbols, no idea.  So, display?  It is difficult to believe that a product so clever, was designed by the same group who developed the display.  Nearly useless.  I had first tried a model with a larger display, and much more expensive.  Same issues, unreadable in sunlight, symbols with no explanation etc.  Hopeless.So, who needs a display anyway?  You have the app,  But the app takes a while to ""synchronize"" with the band or watch, so there is lag.  Now we come to perhaps a more serious issue, accuracy.  On this unit, during the brief period it actually worked, the heart rate seemed fairly accurate, except when I worked out, and then it would report a rate in the 60 to 80 range, when a good pulse oximeter showed over 150.Then there is blood oxygen readings, SPO2.  Hopelessly inaccurate, not even in the ball park.So my experience with this and similar items, was a fair amount of frustration and in the end a total waste of time.  I find it interesting that none of the normally useful review sources, such as Wired, Tom's Guide, etc seem to offer truly in depth reviews.  It looks as though they are reviewing the mfg's list of features, rather than doing the hard work of using and evaluating the devices.  Sad, all round, IMHO.  Dave J"
698,KLTmom,2,the United States ,5-Aug-22,"Not for kids or preteens, touchscreen watch face not responsive","I was swayed by the amount of positive reviews and the description right in the title of this product that it would be suitable for kids, namely my preteen who is of average height and weight for her age.  When I tried it on her we put it on the smallest possible size setting and it was extremely loose, like a bangle bracelet!  For it to be even remotely touching her skin all around so that it would be snug enough not to move, she would have had to wear it more than halfway up her arm.  I had tried it on previously and even for me I had to use the fourth hole setting from the smallest setting, and I'm an adult.I downloaded the app and tried it out myself.  The app is quite complicated because there are so many choices and measurements it can take, from steps to blood oxygen levels, heart rates, sleep tracking, etc.  You can customize the watch face, get notifications from your phone (you pair it to your smartphone via the app and bluetooth), choose from different languages, and much more, including of course regular watch functions such as alarms and timers.  I would have to say that for the price it can do a lot, and the graphics and screen are very good--crystal clear, sharp, and the colors are bright.  BUT, aside from the fact that my daughter cannot possible use it, I was very frustrated with the touchscreen interface.  I have an Apple Watch as does my husband, and he also has Fossil and Citizen smartwatches as well, so we are both experienced with using smartwatches and their touchscreens.  Of course for the price of this Amazfit smartwatch I do not expect it to be on par with our pricer, much more expensive smartwatches, but I expect the touchscreen to at least work somewhat okay.  Well, it doesn't.  I would constantly have to touch/retouch/tap/retap/slide/re-slide to access various functions; it was very annoying.  The touchscreen is just not very intuitive and not very responsive.  So while this smartwatch has a lot of functions, has a great screen, a good app (once you figure everything out), and is quite affordable, none of that matters if you value interacting with the watch's touchscreen which does not work properly and is unresponsive to touch the majority of the time.  If all you want it to do is tell time, you may be okay with it, but then you probably do not need a smartwatch in the first place."
699,Anton Dovydaitis,2,the United States ,14-Oct-22,"Have to recharge every night, so can't monitor sleep.","I bought this last year from Target, and I only had to recharge it about every four days.  This one I just bought lasts about a day.  If I recharge it every night, how is it supposed to monitor sleep?The user interface on the watch itself is not intuitive, is not documented anywhere I could find, and not every feature is supported in the Zepp App. For example, the watch can track swimming laps, but you can't start or stop it with the Zepp App, and I was never able to figure out how to start and stop swimming workout.Because of my previous experience with this model, I expected it to work the same, and was willing to accept its performance because of the price and battery life.  Charging every day is unacceptable.  Sadly, I did not keep the original packaging because I assumed it would work as well as last time, so I can't return it.When I do replace this, I will be choosing a different brand, with a better application, and more reliable battery.  Recharging every day means I cannot recommend this even as just a watch."
700,Patrick,2,the United States ,30-Nov-22,"So hard to get on, but all too easy to come off (accidentally)","The design of the band is not great. I've had issues with the original band and replacement bands. The good thing is the replacement bands are cheap. 5 stars on the battery life. The thing lasts forever. But if anything contacts the point that keeps the band attached to my wrist (including the skin from my arm) it pops off. Because of this I've dropped it a few times and had to go looking for it. Also, I don't like how the app has a notification that's active 24/7 that I can't dismiss, telling me whether the band is connected or not. Other than that, the Alexa works great. The SMS/IM notifications are convenient. It's cool being able to control my phone's music with the watch. If the band had a better design and the app didn't have a 24/7 notification I couldn't dismiss, I would rate this item significantly higher."
701,Julie,2,the United States ,30-Nov-22,HR monitoring is often flakey,"I initially got this for my mom to wear while she was having some AFib.  After she was done she didn't want to use it.  So now I wear it regularly.  I really like to monitor my HR however I have been finding this device is often way off on the reported number, usually it is way low when it should be a lot higher such as during cardio.  The only other option I use it for is 'cycling' where it monitors distance & time w/ GPS.  It plots it on a map in the app and gives audio updates every mile, its kinda cool so I do like that.the watch band often gets a light snag on something and un buckles.  luckily the little button it has doesn't slip through the loop as easily and it never really has truly fallen off."
702,Socali,2,the United States ,24-Feb-22,Not accurate- glitchy- frustrating,"First, I appreciate any electronic device that is easy to set up, intuitive, and somewhat accurate. This is none of the above. I bought Amazfit 5 off Amazon Treasure Truck as I have been wanting a exercise tracker. It was a good price and smaller than others on the market I’ve been looking at. Out of the box no instructions, just a QR code. So in this case, it must be an easy set up right? Nope. The QR code had instructions to set up an app no longer available or renamed. That was the first issue. I had to research on web the newly named Zepp app and install. After install of the app , the Amazfit 5 was not intuitive on how to transfer Apple health info to device or for how to use. On to the exercise: I’m hiking UP a trail on foothills mountain (sucking in air and sweating) with my hubby, and it’s not counting steps or reflecting increase heart rate. My husband has another more reliable exercise device and his records 8900 steps and Amazfit 5 states I’ve only gone 3500 steps and heart rate is 79 bpm. So I go back to web to research. I read if the device is not tight enough to make sure it’s really snug. I had it on last wrung and it’s snug, too snug really. At night, the sleep info is garbage, stating I went to sleep 2 hours before actual, with other info that I believe to be in accurate. Yesterday, I tested it again. I had been doing yard work for an hour and it had me at zero steps. I took it off, wiped electrodes next to skin in case dirt or sweat is involved, and placed it back on. Hubby and I went for 3.5 mile trail walk, again inaccurate recordings. I’m not looking for precision, but somewhere in the ballpark is what I desire. This stated I walked 2 miles (we did 3.5 mile trail loop) and heart rate never went over 100bpm and we did stairs sucking in air. I know my heart rate had to have been at least 148 bpm. I returned home and took it off feeling very disappointed. I don’t want to research why this isn’t working or what steps to problem solve. I want it to work. So back in the box, I’m going to return -disappointed. If you are looking for accuracy, try Apple Watch or a Fitbit. I know these work better."
703,brig,2,the United States ,14-Jul-22,Doesn't accurately count steps,"I really liked this fitness tracker.  I like all the features.  It wasn't easy to set up at first, but once I found the online instructions, it worked like a charm.  I didn't use all of the functions.  I only had it 4 days when I realized it wasn't accurately counting my steps.I went to a warehouse club to shop and walk because it was so hot and humid outside.  I pushed a cart and walked every aisle twice for an hour.  When I got home, I checked my steps and it only showed 600 steps during that hour.  I checked the steps on my cellphone GPS step counter and it showed 3,000 steps during the same time period.  I looked at the Zepp application on my cellphone and it verified that it showed I only walked 600 steps.  In fact, it sent an idle alert while I was walking!  When I thought about it, I decided to check if moving my arm makes a difference.  It sure does.  If I don't move my arm with the tracker, it doesn't count my steps. When I moved my arm up and down, forwards and backwards without walking, it showed a lot of steps.  Since I don't normally swing my arms when I walk, this tracker is definitely not for me.  Sorry, but it's going back to Amazon.The other features work great, like the sleep monitoring and the heart rate monitor.  But I wouldn't recommend it if someone's looking for accurate step counting."
704,Caitlin,2,the United States ,22-Sep-22,Question accuracy and product not as advertised,"I am not impressed with this tracker. The battery life is probably half of what is advertised and in the two weeks I've used it I have several times gotten notifications that I've been sitting too long right after getting up to walk into the kitchen or go to the bathroom. In one instance, I was at a concert standing (and shifting my weight frequently because my feet hurt), walked about 15 feet to the bar to get drinks and back, and my watch buzzed that I had been sitting too long. So I don't really trust the accuracy of the device.Additionally, I have not been able to get it to respond to Alexa voice commands as advertised and I find that the app is not one that is supported by other programs (like MyFitnessPal or Noom). I was able to connect to Noom by sending the data to GooleFit first and then from GooleFit to Noom, but I don't like needing an additional app just to serve as go between."
705,Peggy Portwood,2,the United States ,15-Jun-22,Accuracy?,"I have had the AmazFit Band 5 for a week now and I have mixed feelings. I gave it a 2 star because the connectivity doesn't seem to work. When I first connected the band to my Bluetooth it took several times and I actually did a factory reset on the band and after it connected. My phone prompted me that there were several updates that needed to happy for the band. The 11th was the last time it connected to my phone. Now I can't get the band to connect. It says to keep the watch close to the band and I am literally laying it on my phone, NOTHING!I am also concerned for the accuracy of the heart rate monitor. I had asked a question about the accuracy and didn't get an answer. Well I shouldn't say that. The person who responded said they weren't sure how accurate it is. :( I work at an insurance agency and sit at a desk all day. My band keeps alerting me that my heart rate is too high. It will fluctuate when I am sitting still from 73 to 120.  I would like to be able to trust what the band is telling me, but I really don't think it is accurate. When I get the alert that my heart rate is too high, I have been manually taking my pulse and it's around 70-75bpm.I was going to purchase one for my kids, but I won't think I would ever buy this again. I am chalking it up to a junk purchase that I will lose interest in and end up throwing it away."
706,Alexandroid,3,the United States ,5-Dec-22,Good entry level fitness bracelet,"I've been using it for a little over a year. It measures steps, heartbeat and sleep activity automatically. It can also measure SpO2 (blood oxygenation level) and stress level on demand. For these functions it works well. You can also setup a vibrating alarm (via the phone) to wake up in the morning without waking the rest of your family.The main annoyance is the mobile app (Android) which requires you to periodically open it to sync the data from the bracelet. I don't understand why it doesn't do it automatically, like, once a day, even if I keep the bracelet connect led to my phone all the time. The app doesn't give you a lot of insights. It shows the stats but does not seem to recommend much. Another annoyance is that when you workout, the bracelet will detect it (like after 5 minutes of walking) but it will ask you to confirm to record this session. If you miss that notification and don't click ""yes"", then it won't record anything. This doesn't make any sense.The main letdown which I knew about before buying but still miss a lot is that while the bracelet sort of detects sleep cycles, it does not have a function to adjust your wake time / alarm to wake you up during the light sleep cycle. Perhaps that's because the sleep cycle tracking is very basic and not reliable? One cannot verify of it's a real data or made up using some heuristics.I am not using Alexa or other functions like periodic SpO2 or stress measurements, or the snoring detection - the app has a ton of warnings that it will destroy the battery life. Without those niceties I love that the bracelet lasts over a week before needing to charge again. And the charging is pretty quick, takes less than an hour, I think.The plastic clasp broke shortly after a year, but there are replacements you can buy. I've got a metal replacement because the locking mechanism on the plastic clasp was annoying me because of how flimsy it was. It was easy to accidentally open it if it caught on a sleeve or something else.For the price though, it's a good ""first fitness bracelet"" to start keeping the tabs on your activity and vitals and seeing if such knowledge motivates you to be more active."
707,jalkyl,3,the United States ,3-Dec-22,"Easy to use, but question the results of most everything it measures","It seems pretty durable.  I have a problem not banging my arms into everything I walk past, and while the surface of the watch is scratched and chipped, It could be worse. I think I am just brutal on things.  I even manage to scratch my sapphire crystal watch face regularly, so take that under advisement.It is easy to use. Put it on it tracks steps, tracks heart rate, and tells you when it thinks you are sleeping.The basic readings seem ok.  Steps and heartrate are usually solid. Distance travelled and speed while running and walking are also fine. Although repetitive are movements are counted as steps.All the rest of it are pretty bad.  I have insomnia.  I sleep terribly on a regular basis.  When I am awake for 5 hours using my phone in the middle of the night It might say I was awake for 5 minutes.  When I fall asleep at 10:00 and wake up before midnight and am awake at midnight, it records the sleep from 10-11:50 as a nap and disregards it in my sleep cycle.Calorie recording is pretty skewed on the high side. It records virtually any exercise as 800 calorie per hour level of exertion. Not trustworthy there.After owning it for 6 months or so am lucky if the battery lasts more than 3-4 days. No where near 15.The exercise options are pretty limited, too. The app shows badminton as an option, but I can not get that on the watch. I play aa lot of racquet sports and so have to tell the watch I a doing yoga or something to track the exercis"
708,Jessi,3,the United States ,18-Nov-22,Disable all the features that you love about it and the battery lasts 48 hours. Read the FAQs first.,"I was looking for a smart watch that would give text notifications, track O2 in my sleep, and be mildly helpful during a workout, and not be insanely expensive like the Apple Watch or Fitbit. This watch does all of that, but you have to charge it twice a day. I had to go through the item details to the FAQ to find a small paragraph that said to disable the sleep tracking, the auto tracking, and auto app updates to preserve battery life. As it is, I get 48 hours when my watch is NOT connected to my phone via bluetooth. But if I want to see incoming texts (a useful feature for women who can't have clothing with decent pockets), I get about 30 hours before needing to charge.At the end of the day, I decided you get what you pay for, and the sleep O2 tracking wasn't worth having to charge it every 6 hours.For those of you who want it laid out nice and simple: It's a HUGE upgrade from the 30$ walmart option, and great for people who want to use it casually and aren't that hardcore into work out (you maybe do 30 minutes of exercise a day and want a step tracker). But if you're a gym rat or want all of the features to do all of the things all of the time, Just go with a Fitbit."
709,East of the Pacific,3,the United States ,31-Dec-20,"Amazfit Band 7 - Always-On Display is Great, Otherwise, Everything Just OK","First, this review is for the Amazfit Band 7 watch. I also have an Amazfit Band 5 watch, and for some reason, Amazon has decided that to submit a review for the Band 7, I need to edit my Band 5 review. That makes no sense. These are two different watches.I have had my Band 7 for a little over a month. I wear it every day.I had the Band 5 for about two years. It is a good watch. Frankly, for many things, it is better than the Band 7, which is why my review for the Band 5 was 4 stars, but I am only giving the Band 7 3 stars. But I am not returning the Band 7 because it has one very important feature for me that the Band 5 lacks, and that is the always on display. it makes it so easy to use the watch discretely during a meeting. With the Band 5, you have to either tap the screen or flick your wrist. Neither are subtle.As for battery life, I am getting about 4 days between charges. That is with the always on display on, and continuous heart rate monitoring on. I also have the watch set to vibrate every time I get a work email, so I'm sure that uses a lot of power. I do not use it to track my sleep. I did that a few times in the first week, but while it is interesting data, overall, I am not planning to modify my sleep patterns to make my watch happy. The battery life on the Band 5 was a day or two longer, but that does not have an always on display. Clearly, adding that display uses a lot of power. I'm not surprised. And I am not really concerned. Recharging the watch twice a week is no big deal as a tradeoff for the new display.It is also nice to have a larger display that definitely makes reading text easier.There are two main reasons why I am moving the rating down a star compared to the Band 5.First, the Band 5 had a function that let you automatically dim the display at night, and bring up the brightness in the morning. The Band 5 took away that function. Instead, you pick a brightness. You can manually adjust the brightness, but for the life of me, I can't understand why that functionality was removed. It worked well and made the Band 5 easier to use. Also, I assume it helped increase the battery life a little.The other issue I have is with the watchfaces. The Band 7 has a few watchfaces that you can access through the Zepp app. The Band 5 had thousands of watchfaces available in the Amazfaces group (amazfitwatchfaces.com), and it looks like Band 7 watchfaces are starting to trickle in to that site. While Zepp will let you develop watchfaces on their developer website (developer.zepp.com), it is pretty clear they don't want to distribute watchfaces their in-house team did not develop. I submitted a watchface to Zepp for review and approval. It was reviewed and rejected. The rejection was in Chinese. I don't know Chinese (sorry Zepp). I suspect the vast majority of Americans and Europeans also don't know Chinese. Thanks to Google Translate, I found out that my watchface was rejected because I used a two-digit year, rather than a four-digit year. That is, my date displays as ""11/20/22"" rather than ""11/20/2022"". Of course, displaying a two-digit year is an option in their design template. But clearly, they don't want you to use it.From what I can tell, Zepp wants developers to come up with health apps, not watchfaces. Maybe that is the future. But for me, I don't see it as compelling, especially in a $40 watch with just heart rate and oxygen saturation sensors. For me, seeing time, steps and battery level is important. And I really like seeing some of the creative ways that the Amazfaces group has come up with to display those critical items."
710,stormbringeram1,3,the United States ,14-Jun-21,Disappointing accuracy in step counters when using walking workout,"By far one of the worst accuracy with the step counters when chosen walking as a workouts.  In a 3.5 miles walk about 7000 steps, it lose about 2000 steps and base on phone GPS it also lose .6 miles. I have tested this 3 times in the last 3 days walking a distance about 3 to 3.5 mile. The short distance walk of 2000+ steps 6-11-2021 was closer to being accurate but for some reason the Zepp app decided to drop my morning walk on the history log. Comparing it to Google fit app on phone and manual step counter the Zepp app report is highly inaccurate in steps and average speed and mileage walk. Look at the included images of the Zepp app report walking map distance 3.08 mile, the Zepp app reported a step counts of 4,783 steps dropping about 2000 steps. It did do good  on the short 1.18 miles walk in the attached image on the first short afternoon walk after questionable accuracy on morning walk. This may have something to do with it not having a GPS and relying on using the phone GPS which could be the causing this the problem.  The Amazfit band 5 does have some nice feature such as a Sleep monitoring, a heart rate monitor that is relatively accurate, and a SpO2 monitor for referencing approximate blood gas. The workout is only limited to 12 type, it doesn't include weight training as an option. I'm not saying this is a bad smart fitness tracker, but the main purpose that I have purchased this unit was to track my brisk daily walking so far have been inconsistently and not accurate when pairing it with my Moto G Power phone GPS. I would have given this a 4.5 stars rating if not for the steps inaccuracy tracking. The phone Google fit app give a much better result so far comparing to my Garmin GPS.  I have this unit for just 5 days so far,  with further testing I may make change my rating of the Amazfit band 5.  Update 06-21-2021 Returning item for another replacement Amazfit 5 bandFurther walk workout testing indicated the unit in my possession may have a defective 3 axis accelerometer chip. The step counter consistently drop 2000 to 3000 steps when I've walked 3 to 5 miles regardless of using the phone GPS or not. I went for a short 3 miles walk today which usually equate to about 6500 steps for my height. The Amazfit band 5 band recorded 4235 step dropping 2000+ steps.  Good things Amazon have a easy to use return policy.  Update 09-08-2021 Overall this is a 3.5 stars out of 5 product, the replacement Amazfit 5 step counter work much better but still have steps count inaccuracy. I'm sure it have to with motion algorithm that compensate for arm movement. Using a hammer motion or jumping up and down would count as steps, keep that in mind. If you're over 50 and use reading glasses, the text message transfer to your band are too small to read without straining your eye. The Amazfit band 5 only use the the middle section of the AMOLED screen, you get unused black space on the top and bottom of the screen.  The screen is hard to read on sunny outdoor activity. The SPO2 monitor can't be use for tracking sleep apnea because it's on demand variety, but it does monitoring your heart rate when sleep tracking is turn on. I don't think the sleep tracking is accurate in my opinion. The Amazfit band 5 is just an okay smart band in this vast field of fitness tracker."
711,Atman,3,the United States ,3-Dec-22,"Good product for the money, but O2 meter doesn't work and no HRV","The band was on sale and I bought it at a great price.  However, I could never get a reading from the O2 meter even after contacting support.  Also, there is no HRV measurement.  The ad claimed to measure stress so I have no idea how it could do that without a HRV reading.  The band is good at tracking steps and heartrate so I'm keeping it despite no O2 meter or HRV measurement.  It costs much less than other products than only do these measurements as well.  So far has very good battery life and it seems reasonable accurate.  If you need just a cheap step tracker and heartrate meter, then I would recommend it."
712,Stephanie,3,the United States ,5-Dec-22,Nice watch for temporary use.  Battery last 1 week.,"I like this watch because the face of it is small as is my wrist.  The band is ok, but too big for me.  I would like a small fitting band where I can know that the sensor is more accurate against my skin.  I also know that this watch does not have a detection feature to automatically detect the exercise that you are doing.  I happen to walk a lot and for this to record me walking, I have to manually start the walking timer.  The timer pauses when I am not swinging my arm, it will start again when movement is detected.  Same with other workouts.  The app is easy to use."
713,Avery Freeman,3,the United States ,1-Oct-22,Amazfit band 5 does NOT have always on display,"Contrary to what the documentation says, the Amazfit band 5 does NOT have always on display. I bought it specifically because I was looking for a replacement for my vivofit 4, as I have broken two of them already within a month and a half (the earlier ones were very durable, but the 4 has some kind of design flaw and the buttons stop working fairly quickly). So I bought the Amazfit band 5 since its documentation and help site both say that there's an always on display option. As far as I can tell that's not true. The watch will wake up when you lift it to look at your screen. That is definitely not the same thing as an always on display. I'll see if it works out while I'm working and frequently need to check the time, but I'm not holding my breath. I wish the people who sold these things would be more precise when describing them, my guess is it's a translation issue. Other than that, for the price it seems fine, and might be ok considering I'd have to spend $70-$80 on an old vivofit 3 since people have figured out the vivofit 4 is garbage and have started price gouging people who want one that will last longer than a month or two."
714,Peg Berge,3,the United States ,5-Nov-22,hate  the band  and the pai,"the bank comes off constantly.. it has fallen into things I am working on and considering that I am a cook, that is not good. I wish I could remove the PAI thing cuz I get maybe MAYBE 2 days with the battery with that on there.. I can't find my blood pressure, I no longer can find the pulse rate, the oxygen thing, the sleep thing, basically all I can find now is the time and the stupid pai thing that I dont' give a rats butt about.. I know this wasn't the most expensive watch out there, but thought it was better than this.. very disappointed.. I don't sleep a lot and I sometimes doze off in my chair after work.. it wakes me up after I have worked 15 hrs on my feet to tell me I have been sitting still too long.. lol.. that one cracks me up..."
715,Sofeeyah,3,the United States ,23-Sep-22,Maaan Idk,"If had this awhile, barely wear it now but initially it seemed okay.I'm not sure if it's totally accurate because I hit 10K steps pretty quickly every day even though I was walking around a lot but it just seems off.The band is the DUMBEST THING EVER. NO security at ALL. Omg, this thing has fallen off plenty of times. Thankfully it has a red blaring light so you can see that it's fallen off but I could've easily dropped it at the gym and went home and been like AHH MY WATCH! 😂It is extraaa special flimsy in the regard.I do like that it has features for every kind of exercise but I think it's messed up because when I go to cycling it just doesn't track? It also would just pause randomly and it was soo annoying.All in all, there are better knock off watches if you can't spend the bread on a fitbit, samsung watch or apple watch. I think I'll just save for my apple watch and call it day 😂I would definitely take your money elsewhere to avoid the complete annoyance that is this watch. It just sits in my room now."
716,SJHillman,4,the United States ,6-Nov-22,Pretty Good For The Price,"I've been using it 24/7 for nearly a month now and, overall, I'm happy with it considering the low price.- Fairly accurate for steps, heartbeat, and tracking distance. Comes within 5% or so of what I get measuring them other ways, though sometimes it does miss steps. Slightly more accurate than my old Fitbit.- Sleep tracking is decent, but maybe one day in ten or so misses when I fall asleep by up to a couple hours and thinks I fell asleep at 1 or 2am when I actually fell asleep at 10:30 or 11pm.- Display is nice. Bright enough to see easily in all but the most direct sunlight, and can even still be read then, just not as easily. Pretty good range of brightness, though I wish it could go just a bit dimmer for at night. Being able to schedule when lift-to-view is on vs tap-to-view is great, so I can lift-to-view during the day and it's disabled for at night. I wish you could schedule screen brightness the same way, as I have it at about 75% brightness during the day then have to manually turn it to minimum at night and back up in the morning.- Touch sensitivity is pretty good overall. Very little delay or lag and it almost never misses a swipe. Controls are intuitive. Biggest issue is that due to the small screen size and my big fingers, it does sometimes confuse a left swipe and a down swipe, but that's a minor nuisance at best. Another big drawback is that water droplets register as touches. So spray from taking it in the shower makes it think someone is swiping all over it. Locking the screen doesn't help, as it's a simple swipe-up-to-unlock and the random droplets do that within seconds. So I take it off for showers and problem solved.- The included watchfaces make for a decent selection, but I do wish there were a few more practical choices with high information density and simple designs rather than the more gaudy showy faces. You can make your own, but it's quite a chore using the Zepp Watch Face Maker, as nearly *everything* needs to be a separate image file, including each individual letter, number, decimal, etc.- Battery is good. I lose around 10%/day with the sensors turned up slightly higher than recommended, and charge it around once a week (by which time it rarely goes below 50%). The magnetic charging cable is nice, if a bit short, compared to the ""docking"" style chargers that Fitbit usually uses. In the last 20 minutes since I sat down, it's charged from 58% to 91%... pretty good.- Not a huge fan of the rubber watch band. It's mildly uncomfortable to wear tight and a tiny bit hard to put on and adjust. I figured I'd give it a month or two before seeing if there's any cloth bands that might be more comfortable. I have had it come loose at some inconvenient times after being caught on something, but the style of the band does prevent it from falling straight off like my old Fitbit would, which is rather nice. But, considering the price, it is a decent band.- The Android phone app is decent, but confusing the navigate. I had a little trouble getting it working at first, but after restarting both the phone and the watch once they were paired, I haven't had any issues since. It's pretty responsive other than the built-in Help pages, which refuse to load. It offers pretty good detailed charts and stats and good customization for the watch... it's just difficult to remember where to find what sometimes.- Alexa was slightly confusing to set up (but worked a lot better after restarting the watch and no problems since) and doesn't always listen even when it says Listening, but overall works well and is usually responsive. One downside I've found is that you can only have three reminders active at once on it, which is a feature I use Alexa for heavily. So best to only use it for short-term reminders so you don't clog that limited queue. But other general Alexa features work pretty well.- Text alerts are pretty nice and easy to read in spite of the limited screen size. The watch doesn't always know when a message has already been read on the phone though and will alert on it again, but that's quite rare.In the end, I had considered several more expensive smartwatches, but I'm glad I went with this one since I mostly just wanted something for casual fitness and health monitoring. Not everything works perfectly, but weighing quality against price, I'd consider it an excellent value."
717,Ryan M,4,the United States ,3-Dec-22,An excellent barebones fitness tracker let down by mediocre software.,"The Band has a rectangular bracelet form factor somewhat reminiscent of old, lower-end Fitbits. The bracelet is made from strong plastic and easily swapped out for cheap and plentiful replacements. The core of the Band is a very durable plastic computer with a home button that functions completely intuitively. The charging cable is short and unique to the Band - I haven’t seen another like it before or since. Don’t lose it.The limited number of mostly lame digital faces give you the same information- time, date, steps, heart rate. You can scroll vertically up or down away from the home screen through dedicated “apps” for specific functions like starting a workout, reading notifications, or controlling music.Software for this thing is just not great. The aforementioned apps - controlling music and reading notifications rarely function well if at all. Amazfit requires you use their third party phone app “Zepp” to change watch faces or use many functions on the Band itself. Zepp is poorly translated from Mandarin to English, sends random phone notifications despite notifications being off in Settings, and has odd privacy issues that use data at random and unexplainable times.“Workouts” on the Band only really function properly for cardiovascular workouts like running and cycling - this definitely misses the mark for weightlifting/powerlifting and might only really properly track exertion for crossfit workouts in terms of reps and heart rate.The main appeals for the Band: it’s cheap and the battery lasts 3+ weeks at a time. If you can’t decide if you want to get into fitness wearables, this is the best starting point in the industry, bar none. Dip your toes in with this for $30 or less and wear it for three months.At that point, decide for yourself what you want:1) a more premium user experience at the expense of fitness tracking? Apple Watch.2) a more premium fitness experience with great battery life with weird UI? Garmin, Polar, suunto, etc.3) an ultra-premium fitness experience at the expense of being chained to a subscription? Whoop4) the next level of Amazfit product, because their interface is passable and it does what you need for cheap? T-Rex ProI wound up choosing #4 and I don’t regret it at all. Give it a shot and see what you end up deciding."
718,Gori,4,the United States ,25-Nov-22,Good for the price but,"I used it for more than a year and like it in general. It has nice compact design. I have some trouble seeing smaller font details, but when I use glasses, they look good. It has important functions for a smart band. Alexa is a big plus (you can give audio commands and it can display answers, but not voice answer). Heart rate monitor is OK, sometimes it looks accurate and sometimes it doesn't even if I have the band tight. I know my heart rate when I do my exercises is around 130, but sometimes it only shows 90 and a few times it shown 150, even I checked the pulse manually to ensure it is around 130. It connects to your Android to get coordinates and track you walking. But pretty often, when you start the walk mode from the band, it does not track coordinates. So you can see the summary of your walk on the Android application, but not the map [I keep the phone with me all the times so shouldn't be any connectivity issue]. However, if I start the same walk from the mobile app, it tracks fine most of the times. I like ability to install custom face so that you have it look what you like and information you need. Customer service is OK. They were responsive in the beginning, but when I started coming back for the same unresolved issues with heart rate monitoring and walk map, they just stopped responding on my requests. But some people may consider those issues not much important. One nice feature, which could compensate for inability to switch to a sport mode and from, would be a buzz every X minutes when you are in a sports mode. I exercise often and often forget to turn the sport mode off. Expensive bands would turn it off automatically based on pulse. For inexpensive ones like this I would imagine they could easily implement a buzz every X configurable minutes to remind. I would consider buying Band 7 for me and my wife, but I am afraid it has the same issues."
719,katy de leon,4,the United States ,9-Nov-22,Alexa no está disponible!!!,"La entrega estuvo bien! Pensé que era más grande pero esta Perfecto! Llevo dos días usándolo y me funciona Perfecto hasta ahora y la batería muy bien y la predicción todo bien, lo único es que dice que viene  Alexa integrado pero solo para México, USA y otros países seleccionados! Y no para República Dominicana 🇩🇴 u otro país de Latinoamérica tengo entendido (excepto Mexico) espero que en una pronta actualización pueda arreglarse esto y también el poder contestar mensajes, por el momento solo se pueden leer las notificaciones, que también solo pueden llegar si el aparato está conectado con el teléfono ,y también son muy pocas las apps que se pueden descargar, espero y amplíen esto con juegos, ver fotos y apps mas útiles para el día a día y también de música como Amazon Music,  Music o Spotify (Que solo se conecta vía Bluetooth) . La banda viene con el tamaño ajustable entonces no te preocupes si te quedaría pequeña o grande. También tengo entendido que Alexa no responde vía voz! Solo te puede escuchar pero no te contestara como usualmente lo hace. Espero que pronto haiga mas estilos y diseños de bandas! Por cierto, la mía la pedí en el color negro, pero además de todo eso es muy buena y muy útil! Te recomiendo que antes de adquirirla busques review en YouTube y así te orientes mejor para saber si se ajusta a tus comodidades, aunque creo que sirve ya para la vida cotidiana o más si solo la quieres para ejercitarte, 90% recomendado! 👌🏼 cualquier otra pregunta no dudes en preguntarme 😉"
720,Sherishe,4,the United States ,5-Dec-22,Update. I got it to work!,Thus is an update to my poor review of the watch. It finally worked after I figured out I had to actually touch the pair first symbol. It then paired. The features are actually good for a low price watch and the screen although is little..works for me. I don't know how accurate it is but it seems ok. It alerts when you haven't moved lately so that's a plus. It also has a breathing exercise function which is useful. ..which guides your breathing for like a minute. Yeah I like the watch. Its an ok to good buy for me. However the company needs better directions. That way we know if it works or not. I know it may be an older watch..bit if people are still buying then we deserve a better manual. Not everyone is techsmart.  I vocoder myself to be savvy and I had a heck of a time. So maybe better instructions. Overall great gift buy. Good watch. Nice price.
721,Luv 2 Shop,4,the United States ,19-Oct-22,"will not really pair with gadget bridge, a privacy app. without the app watches barely worth it","I read about how people are stealing and selling your personal health information now and using it to track you and I have been hacked too many times to count so I am very much against anything that tracks me. But I read that there was a private act that worked with this watch called gadget bridge. So I quickly bought it. I am very unhappy. Gadget bridge is only made for people who have degrees in coding apparently. All I needed to set up the final pairing was some sort of authentication code. Trying to find out how to get this or how to get to work was next to impossible I tried numerous times. I read informational articles on it. I asked the community forum, no answer. No customer service from gadget bridge. The watch only tells you to use their app which is not private at all. I would like a watch that was rechargeable slim and showed me the time when I wanted to sneak a peek. No you cannot sneak a peek with this watch. It is hard to get the face to come up. It will however if you sit for a while measure your heart beat when you ask it to and remind you if you've been sitting for an hour which is somewhat healthy. It gives a random idea of the steps and activity you have had during the day although it is not exact. I really just wanted a rechargeable sturdy watch that didn't look too bad on my wrist. If only I could see the time when I wanted to!"
722,Alexia Johnson,4,the United States ,22-Nov-22,Great but this battery life isn’t what was promised,"This is a great watch that exceeded my expectations, HOWEVER the biggest disappointment was the advertised battery life which is way inaccurate. I have all the settings on low battery and the watch only lasts about 10-12 hours. This is a major complaint which I think was fixed in the 7. If I had known that I would’ve spent the extra to get the upgraded model. This does not have even two day battery life so for it to advertise 18 days is wild to me and is a straight lie. I don’t have the continual head monitoring or Alexa linked which is supposedly the biggest use of battery according to customer service. This is a GREAT WATCH, but do not buy it if you need it to last several days which is why I bought it for camping and stuff."
723,RRK,4,the United States ,27-Nov-22,No Alexa and very inaccurate o2 reading,"I ordered this watch specifically for the oxygen feature. I have problems with both lungs and have to check my o2 at least 4 or 5 times throughout the day. As an example, the watch read 95 but my finger oximeter, which is very accurate, only read 89. That's a huge difference when it comes to medical accuracy. Just as a note for anyone who needs an accurate o2 reading... This is the third watch I've bought for that purpose. None have been at all close to accurate.The item listing says you can use Alexa on the watch. The watch itself says it's not compatible. Which was another plus I was looking for.If these functions aren't important to you, it's not a bad watch for the money. Everything else works as advertised."
724,Tammy Voelpel,4,the United States ,9-Nov-22,Comparable to Fitbit HR,"The first purchase would not sync with any devices. Customer service spent three days sending me photos, descriptions, and directions about what I was doing wrong. I finally got fed up and returned it. My husband, thankfully, convinced me to try again. I'm glad I did. The second purchase connected immediately to my device, and I haven't had a single issue with function. It has now been synced to multiple devices. The Amazfit watch is comparable to Fitbit, at 1/4 of the price, and includes high and low temps at your location for the day. I dropped a star for the customer service and band. My hands are large enough, the watch has never fallen off, but the band does come undone quite easily. I was worried at first the small loop that connects the bands would break due to the constant use, but it has remained strong. The watch has an adequate battery life. Mine lasts a week or more depending on use. Charging is quick too, just a few hours."
725,Jodie Hatcher,4,the United States ,19-Oct-22,Do not buy into Navigation Wear,"Okay so, I do love this band, I've never had one before though so I'm basing this off of limited experience.It's very detailed, the app works well with the band! There's a ton of app possibilities, and personalization. I love that the notifications work with whatever app I have. The faces are cute, I wish more of them had more info available on them but it's okay still. The battery is insane. I had been fiddling with it the entire day and it never went down. Until I added notifications to it, but it's still extensive. Days to get to even 70% now.My issue is not that it doesn't have navigation, it's that there's an app for it, the band's app connects to it in the store, I even bought the Navigation Wear app thinking that was the issue (didn't cost much so I thought I'd take the chance).I looked at questions, no one asked about this band app specifically, but anyhow. Yeah so, great all around but it shouldn't have an app that doesn't work with the band imo. Or at least have a stopping point for the user to be encouraged to buy up, I suppose.I recommend! But be warned."
726,T Fowl,5,the United States ,27-Dec-20,This Band's Usefulness Grows on You,"UPDATED 12-31-2020 [This a a real review]Set up is easy as you download the Zepp app and pair the watch to your bluetooth, then register to sign in. The little band is a bit hard to fasten on your wrist at first as you get used to it, and I have had it come off in bed and once just in everyday use possibly because it wasn't fully secured but more likely due to catching the closure button on something. The read outs are easy to use although the instructions and explanations of functions are somewhat vague. The measurements to input some manual things like blood pressure, body temperature, etc., are only in UK measurements so you have to convert the numbers. Hopefully they will change this for imperial measurements, too. In your profile the standard measurements can be set to imperial or UK so there is no confusion seeing your readouts on your band or in the app.The band itself provides the ability to change around the menus so those you're most interested in can be scrolled to up or down, left or right, quicker.  You can rotate your wrist toward you to activate one of the chosen 45+ provided  watch faces (the automatic watch face reveal can be scheduled to turn off when you're sleeping) or you can just tap the lower part of the face and the length of time for viewing can be changed, too. Then you can scroll the menu so that side to side brings up Alexa/ Notifications in one directions and Weather/Heart rate in the other as they repeat in a circle. Pulling the screen down reveals More/Workout/Weather/Events/Breathing/Stress/Notifications/SpO2/Heart Rate/PAI/Status before returning back the the watch face.MORE gives you options: DND/Alarm/Camera/Music/Stopwatch/Timer/Find Device/Silent/World Clock/Band Display/Settings. When you use the app to download one of the 45+ watch faces (band display) at least five remain as a choice in the Band Display section for quick change. Settings allows further adjustments to the watch face use and ability to reboot.WORKOUT: Outdoor Running/Treadmill/Cycling/Indoor Cycling/Walking/Elliptical/Rowing Machine/Yoga/Jump Rope/Pool Swimming/FreestyleWEATHER gives you current local conditions and forecast for the next six days. Temperature/Humidity/Level/QualityEVENTS are reminders of upcoming things you input by speaking into the watch.BREATHING is an exercise to calm and relax you.STRESS measures your level between 0 and 100 based on heart and pulse ox and other factors.SPO2, also known as oxygen saturation, is a measure of the amount of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin in the blood relative to the amount of hemoglobin not carrying oxygen. The body needs a certain level of oxygen in the blood or it will not function as efficiently. In fact, very low levels of SpO2 can result in very serious symptoms. You can quickly test here to obtain your SpO2.HEART RATE measures the beats per minute, BPM, and can be set to check this periodically or manually here.PAI is the physical activity intelligence that takes data to provide a number up to 100 showing your activity level, and this number climbs as days pass and it automatically computes the number. You can quickly do a manual test here, too, following the on screen directions.STATUS shows your steps, calories used, distance walked, idle alerts (if so set), and previous days step counts.ALEXA is a nice addition and works well with responses in text format. It is not necessary to say the name, Alexa, just scroll to menu and input your command or  question. I often use my Band 5 to turn on/off or command smart lights, plugs, and smart light strips. I can walk in a room and command a light, or change the temperature on the Ecobee Thermostat, if so desired. Very quick responses to questions and computations make this a very nice feature.NOTIFICATION work very well and promptly show on the watch face to be easily read, and can be scrolled if a long message is received.BATTERY LIFE so far seems to be on average around two week at least before a 2 hour charge is necessary using the round magnetically attached plug and short cord. I charged mine after 12 days at 17% remaining charge so it would have gone a full two weeks before going dead.CONCLUSION. There is a lot to explore and I have continued too use a Fitbit Versa for steps and distance as well as another app, MapMyRun, to plot the GPS path and distance. I have not gotten the Amazfit Band 5 to accurately give my distance and show a GPS plotted route like the MapMyRun app provides. However, the step count is more accurate. It may well be that the Versa and MapMyRun app are interfering with the GPS so that Band 5 cannot calculate this properly. I will experiment in time and work with developers to see if a solution can be found, but it's not a big problem for me. MapMyRun's browser data and history with routes is quite satisfactory and I have found history is available when you use the icon in the top right of the Zepp app and see under Exercise Data the Exercise Record where period of time can be selected and individual dates show full data (again, the routes shown and distance/steps are wrong, so far, and still experimenting with this error). The Versa serves as a watch and notifications I can easily read. Band 5 does not provide the ability to switch functions while using the Workout function, but it does show notifications. So you cannot use the Band 5 for anything else during work outs, if I am not mistaken. Note that outside in the sunlight it is very hard to read the screen, however, unless you turn the brightness up under setting to maximum from the default applied to conserve battery.Overall I am very pleased with all the data, including the SLEEP DATA it provides for helping the wearer to better health. A beta Breathing tracking function can be set to check for problems while you sleep and it scored me 99 out of 100. As you turn on things like this it does warn of extra battery use. It could be, and probably will be tweaked so the wearer can more customize it to the wearer's own needs and life. For the price, it is great, and now there is an inexpensive compatible replacement band assortment in 15 colors for easy change to coordinate with your daily wardrobe. As I wear and use the Band 5 I may add more to this review.UPDATE AFTER DST: Strangely the sleep record is not recording on the date it should and runs a day behind. Reporting errors or suggested improvements seems to go unnoticed as the step count is still showing the miles lower than actual, e.g., 3 miles is shown as approximately 2.5 even though the steps are correct, so the stride distance is wrong and possibly due to the GPS not working correctly with my Moto G6 Plus watch. No fix so I depend on my cell's app, MayMyRun, to accurately record this for me."
727,Ricky M.,5,the United States ,4-Dec-22,Best Bang for Buck,"I rarely write reviews but I think this product deserves the hype. I bought this watch about a month ago to replace my Apple watch SE after it decided to quit not even a year into its life. For forty dollars this watch has been able to track my sleep patterns, heart rate, steps taken, hours standing, blood-ox, stress level, etc. The app that connects the watch to your phone is awesome and it makes accessing your info really really easy. Customizing is easy and I honestly liked most of the free built in watch faces that they offer. I get about 5 days battery life out of one charge but that's because of how I configured my watch, I'm sure you could get the 15 or 18 days they advertise just off their factory settings. The screen is simple, haptics are meh, glass is tough but for forty dollars it gets the job done. If you're in the market for a smart watch and don't feel like cracking $250+ for something decent give this watch a try."
728,Janice Gochnauer,5,the United States ,17-Nov-22,"So Far, So Good...but Buy a Screen Protector When You Place Your Order!","Update:  I've been using it for 17 days without charging it.  I just plugged it in to recharge for the first time.  It had 11% battery left, which could have probably lasted me a couple more days.--------Original Review:  I've had it on for 4 full days so far, and in addition to regular everyday walking around, I went on 5 miles worth of brisk walks.  My battery is at 80%.  Very pleased about that.  The screen is nice and bright. I can see it quite easily compared to the Fitbit this replaced.  It has good apps and is easy to navigate, after a short ""getting used to"" period.One issue I would note:  The screen scratches easily.  In less than 24 hours I had scratches on the screen, and they multiplied by the time the screen protector I had ordered arrived.  I am very careful with my electronics, and after seeing the first scratch, I have been very mindful of my Amazfit to try to see what I am doing to cause these scratches. I can't figure out what I am hitting it on.Aside from the delicate glass, I am very pleased with my Amazfit Band 7."
729,toxKyeso,5,the United States ,15-Nov-22,great smart tracker,"I see many reviews knocking the battery and having problems with this device.I didn't realize there are 2 apps that confuse people:  Zepp LIFE and Zepp (with E icon).  Get the Zepp (with E Icon).  I had problems with Zepp LIFE app ... it would not update watch and wouldn't keep synced.Zepp (with E icon) app  works great, it synces great, and updated the firmware first time.So read other reviews and you will see many people are using the wrong APP!  If they say it doesn't update, and doesn't sync and terrible experience,  (I know from experience they are using the WRONG APP)Now, apple watches last around 16 hours if you turn on all the features.To get 15 days or longer, you will have to only use features that you really need or want.  Sleep tracker will deplete the battery pretty fast because it is doing stuff all night,  turning on GPS will drain the battery fast, and other stuff that uses lots of bluetooth, etc will drain the battery.I mostly use steps and timer and stress and breath functions.  And battery lasts 2-3 weeks no problems.Compared to apple watch,  this amazfit band 5 has tons more battery life than apple daily charging.Turn off features that you don't need to extend battery life.There must be 10-20 pro reviews highly praising this Amazfit watch on YOUTUBE.  If you are newbie watch those videos and setup videos.  I did."
730,Dr. JAZ,5,the United States ,6-Nov-22,Amazing features. Great watch for twice the price!,"I've worn a lot of fitness bands, especially a number of Samsung ones that I did like very much.  Samsung stopped making bands and went for expensive watches which drove me away looking for a band that wasn't overwhelmingly expensive and didn't involve a subscription (I'm talking to you Fitbit).  Fitbit was ok but not super special and the monthly subscription is ridiculous! I want I watch, not an obligation.  This watch has almost everything I want, plus tons I didn't know I wanted at such a cheap price it blows my mind.  I'm ordering another one just to have for when this eventually dies, that's how much I like this watch!The battery lasts forever it seems (weeks anyway).  The blood oxygen is interesting and useful. The heart rate and sleep monitors are more indepth and seem more accurate than others (though please don't confuse that any such devices will be totally correct...for that you need medical instruments).  It's got a useful fitness goal called PAI which is complex and helps keep me on track.  Does great at step counting on elliptical orbiter (no one else has landed this before).The only thing missing is a good timer (there is a mindfulness timer which works but you can't set it for any time you want) I like using timers for cooking but otherwise it is amazing watch.I've only had it a month or so, longevity isn't clear but boy do I like it!"
731,Jorge Hernandez,5,the United States ,19-Nov-22,The best smart band I could buy,"It is a smart band with a fairly good autonomy, if you only use it as a watch it can last up to 30 days, the charge is also very fast, since being at 0% battery with only 10 minutes it can be charged up to 70%. it is incredibly fast. Its interface is quite fluid and with the latest update it is more customizable, you can install applications such as a calculator and even the little snake game from the old Nokias and it is very entertaining. The measurements are quite accurate compared to other smart bands and this band 7 includes an option that can measure your stress, heart rate, oxygen level, all with a single touch, you can also talk to Alexa and ask her questions, she will not answer you with voice but you can read everything you ask on the screen."
732,Dr. R,5,the United States ,3-May-22,"best watch I've ever owned, but not always an accurate tracker","I started a new job that required me to be on my feet all day, move around a lot, and wash my hands constantly. It was important to me to have a waterproof watch so I could time certain aspects of my job. I wanted a cheap waterproof watch, and after trying two different 20 dollar watches from The Mart of Wal that both lasted less than a week, I decided to purchase this. I didn't care about tracking anything, I just wanted something cheap but durable that could handle being roughed up and exposed to water that would still tell the time.This thing is amazing for that purpose, but I wouldn't want to rely on it to accurately track biometrics.I've knocked my hand/wrist/arm into walls, pipes, sinks, toilets, desks, doorways hard enough on multiple occasions to wince and be convinced I accidentally cracked the screen. The screen is still flawless, and I didn't put any sort of protector on it. I've washed my hands enough to turn them red, submerged this watch, wiped it with lysol orisopropyl alcohol to disinfect it, accidentally slathered it in lotion, and it's come clean and still works perfectly every time. In fact, after a few months of use, it looks just the same as the day I bought it.11/10 for durability.However, sometimes this thing misreads. One time I had it sitting in the pouch on the front of my lunchbox at work for a few hours, and it decided my heart rate was 40 BPM during those hours despite me not even being in the same room. (Unless my lunchbox has come to life?) Sometimes the device decides my heartrate is 120 while I'm sitting down, or 50 while I'm on my feet, and when I check my pulse with a blood pressure cuff I have in the house, it is most definitely normal. Overall the baseline pulse seems somewhat accurate, it just spikes and falls once or twice a day seemingly at random. The blood oxygen sensor seems to be bamboozled if I'm sweaty or have just washed my hands. One time I was sitting watching TV, and when I got up the watch decided that during the time I was watching TV I was actually asleep and it cheerfully informed me of my 'nap' biometrics.The one set of readings that seems pretty accurate is the step counter / pedometer.  It wasn't a feature I was looking for but now that I have it I like to wear it even when I don't need a watch (mowing the lawn, etc) just to see how many steps I'm putting it.If you have a health condition that requires accurate information, or are serious about tracking, look elsewhere. If you want the world's most durable waterproof watch, this is it. If you're curious but not serious to see your pulse or other readings, and don't need them to be medically accurate, this is probably a good place to start with a basic tracker.The custom backgrounds are a nice perk, but I like having my pedometer information and the current weather displayed on the face, and none of the custom watch face templates have that so I've stuck with the default one. Customize-ability in this is basic but still way more than I was expecting since I bought this just looking for a cheap watch.It's also been EXTEREMELY comfortable to wear. I hate having jewelry on me, won't even wear my wedding ring because I hate the feel of something on my skin like that, but this doesn't bother me unless I'm particularly sweaty.Highly recommend, unless you're looking for accuracy."
733,sapphirerosebud,5,the United States ,14-Oct-22,It is not DOA | Read Me First,"Update 10/27: I am just now at 17% battery life without having to charge. I see other reviews mention that the steps aren't accurate unless arms are moving. This is true to a point. I notice if my arm is fully stabilized with a shopping cart it does not track; however, if I am carrying in groceries it does count (I use a crate to get most of my bags in at once). I use it on my stationary bike and it monitors BPM, but I do question the variance in calorie count between my bike and the watch. I am still liking the watch for the features I wanted - to just track how much or little I move in a day so I am more mindful of my overall health. Working at a desk job from home, I knew I was growing more stationary and needed a visual reminder to move. The fact that this device also reminds me that I haven't gotten up in a while is a bonus. I am not looking for the tracker to work magic and I know I didn't pay the price of some of the other well known names - so I did not expect perfection, just something better than trying to monitor without an aid.Original 10/14: Received and would not power on and no charging indicator. Quickly submitted for replacement. Next morning I tried just leaving original on the charger 30 minutes and it came to life!Battery life was lacking, 50% drop in a day. Tracking was accurate as long as I had it setting on my arm/wrist as prompted.Replacement arrived today and same DOA; however, I promptly charged to 100% and the battery is lasting so far a lot longer than the first. Actually I have been using it just as heavily for several hours and just now at 99%.Sending original back. Will update review if I see any decrease in battery or functionality."
734,Lana,5,the United States ,18-Nov-22,For beginners,I bought this to hopefully make me get up from my desk at work.  I tend to sit at my desk all day working taking very few breaks.  This is perfect for beginners.  Pretty basic does have sleep monitor but I don't think it's very accurate.  I love that it has an alarm that I can set to remind me to get up when I've been sitting too.  Since I sleep in it I also use it as alarm to help me get up in the morning just in case I oversleep.  Great value and perfect for the little bit I use it for.  It does have other features but I don't use all of them.
735,l,5,the United States ,28-Nov-22,Has changed my life,"I think anyone who utilizes a Fitness band will have their life change. This fitness band has motivated me to move more and has made me realize that even though I have an active job once I am off of work, I tend to stay still this band has allowed me to keep track of my movement, my sleep, and how I am overall feeling I really enjoy this band. I even got my dad one. It is very user friendly once you have it figured out."
736,Amazon Customer,1,the United States ,29-Sep-21,BEFORE YOU BUY!,"The fitbit charge 5 is not eligible for return even if you have amazon prime(For safety reasons, items containing flammable liquids or gases can’t be returned to Amazon) so only buy this with the knowledge that you will not get your money back if anything goes wrong. If you have no plans on paying for the fitbit premium subscription then do not buy this as they are very careful not to tell you that half the features of the watch don't work without it. The health metrics dashboard is part of the subscription so without that you don't get SpO2 monitoring, heart rate variability, skin temperature variation, breathing rate during sleep or 14 out of the supposed 20 exercise routines. There is more outside of the withheld features like not being able to turn off gps(the options are dynamic, using the gps built into the watch and just your phone), location services, being auto enrolled into some social club, fitbit selling the data they collect even though it's not a free product(you MUST agree to this in order to setup the watch) and by default having the watch set to send you all sorts of emails but I guess I get upset about that more than other people these days. If you are still ok with that then I can say the watch itself is comfortable to wear. The screen is a bit slow to respond and the image is on the soft side but it's bright enough that sunshine doesn't bother me. I do have a lot of missed inputs(I can swipe 5 or so times before the watch reacts) and also it will register incorrect inputs like moving down when I swipe right. A smaller gripe is that fitbit can't seem to decide on what material the charge 5 is made from. The amazon page says it's stainless steel but the fitbit website where I originally found this on still says it's made of aluminum. The watch is lightweight though. This is about all I have to offer now. I'm stuck with a watch that won't do half of what I bought it for and in my mind amazon is beyond complacent. Until very recently amazon owned fitbit which makes it seem like this scenario was intentional. I have a product that won't work unless I pay essentially a rental fee(formerly to amazon) and I can't return the near useless product because it's now considered to be ""hazardous"" by amazon. I actually bought the charge 5 as a second chance for fitbit after directly buying a charge 4 from amazon(no third party) and RETURNING IT IMMEDIATELY as I payed for a new watch but was instead sent a used model with a screen that was scratched to heck and gunk left on the sensors from the last customer. I doubt that the charge 5 is somehow way more dangerous than the charge 4 and therefore is unsafe to take back to the warehouse. Both watches were safe enough for the warehouse to send them to me and amazon tried to scam me with the charge 4 but I was able to send that back so the way I see it now is that they just factored that into a predatory business model. I have one last thing before I forget. If you didn't know you can look around the add to cart button and under it you will find the amazon return policy. On first glance you will see that it says REFUND OR REPLACEMENT AVAILABLE but make sure you hover the mouse over it because that is not actually amazon saying that it can be returned. I honestly don't remember if I ever noticed that before but I certainly will remember from now on."
737,Just_Me,1,the United States ,6-Jul-22,Upgraded from Inspire 2,"My first fitbit was an Inspire 2, which often stopped reminding me to exercise every hour. I had to reset it more than 4 times in the first year. This fit bit is slightly bigger and looks a lot nicer with its colorful displays. But the problem I have is that I need a horizontal, digital clock face and the only options have really annoying color schemes or there is one very plain one that looks too similar to what I used on the inspire. When I clicked on the clock faces from within the app (things you can buy or download), it shows some really amazing clock faces, an entire collection of Pride clocks that are gorgeous, animals, buildings, etc... the only problem is that none of them are compatible with the Charge 5. I don't know if that's just because it's rectangle instead of square, or if it's because you have to upgrade to the most expensive watch to have the luxury clock options. At this point, the Versa 2 is actually cheaper than what I paid for the Charge 5, so I may switch. As for functionality, the heart rate seems accurate, the stepcounter is large and I like that you can make the vibration stronger, and make the display brighter. I haven't tried it outdoors yet to see if that's helpful. I couldn't see the inspire 2 outside at all. The display on this is really pretty and I do like the different colors that represent different aspects: purple is for sleep, red is for step count and heart... I would love a blue option but they don't seem to use blue very much on this watch in the clock faces, or features. Blue would be beautiful against the black background. When I switched watches today, it downloaded my sleep history from last night onto the new watch so that was convenient. Overall, it's a nice improvement over what I had but they need better/more clock options and also, I can't seem to find the tile app, which saved my life a few times last year, in terms of finding the fitbit once my cats knocked it off the table or shelf and  batted it around the house... tile also found my phone a couple of times. This is a must-have app for any smart watch so I hope they integrate it in the near future.I have added several updates to this review but they aren't posting. This is not a 4 star review. It is now a one star review because the battery drains daily. I do not use ""always on"" - I was promised 7 days. I use max brightness, but without touching the watch very much, it still is dead by the end of the night. I see other users are having the same problem. Also, there are no clock faces for this phone that are good for Generation X or higher. They are all weird, ugly, red/orange/yellow or lime green clocks with odd shapes that obscure the time, or they don't show any of your stats on the main screen so you do have to scroll, which does use battery. I'm returning mine. I really loved the way the watch looked on my arm, but it's not performing as expected. I love the features on this fitbit because they are perfect for people over 50, and the simplicity works for Gen X and Boomers as well, but they really dropped the ball on design and performance. The designs do not meet the best audience for this watch. Younger people would go for the smart watch features that come with the versa, older people don't need them, We do need the health services tho. So give it to us in a more palatable, more reliable way and make sure you can deliver on your product claims or we will make sure everyone around us knows you didn't."
738,Shawn,1,the United States ,2-Oct-22,I Wish I Could Give This Less Than One Star; USELESS!,"I purchased this device and am returning it one day later.  The Charge 5 is an absolute P.O.S.  To start with, it took 13 attempts to get paired to my phone (no exageration).  After that, it took over 3 hours for it to update (and no, the problem is not with my internet).  I had hopes for it at first after I finally got it running.  However, it continually dropped the connection with my phone, and I had to re-pair them.  I tried it on a second phone, and the same problem persisted.I figured I would give it a legitimate try, but the problems continued.  I had it set to battery saving as much as I could; internal GPS and whatnot were all turned off.  Fitbit claims it lasts ""up to 7 days.""  I barely got one day out of a full charge.  I had the Always On display turned off, set to auto so that I came on briefly when I turned my wrist to look at it.  This worked sporadically at best, and that is being generous.  I found that I had to shake my wrist to get the thing to turn on.  So, that aspect did not work either.  I also found that I had to jab my finger at the screen multiple times to get it to wake up.  No, it was not it Sleep Mode for this.I used the Sleep Mode overnight.  This seems to have worked pretty well as what it showed me on the app lined up with what I experienced overnight.  This is the only good thing I can say about the device.The heart rate monitor was completely off.  From what it was showing me, I was on the verge of death.  I compared it with a Polar chest strap that I trust.  The data from the two devices were far apart.Step counts......  It was counting around ten steps--give or take--for each step I took.  I put it on the charger the next morning with around 1500 steps on it.  When I came back to it, the device has magically gained another 500 steps while it was sitting idle.  It was counting steps while I was on the toilet also.The Charge 5 is complete junk.  Add all of these problems to Fitbit hiding all the features most people really buy it for behind a paywall.  Yes, it's good that you get six months of Premium free, but what after that?  If you are not going to have access to and use everything it does, then why pay the $80 per year?  It is inaccurate for use even as a very basic step step counter.  Don't waste your money on this.  I should have heeded the reviews, and now I have to deal with trying to return it.  It lasted one day before I set up the return."
739,J. Charles Lacson,1,the United States ,12-Aug-22,Horrible customer service to get a replacement under warranty!,"Update 08/18/2022: I finally received a replacement Charge 5, 18 days after my initial call. I still found the whole process of getting a replacement stressful. This will be my last Fitbit device.My Fitbit Charge 5 became suddenly inoperable while I was on a business trip. Screen went black, there were no lights coming out of the sensors, it wouldn't charge, and the manual reset with the charger did not work.When I called Fitbit, they told me I needed to get alcohol wipes to clean the watch and the charger. I told them I was staying in a hotel room, and had no such thing. They responded that I needed to get alcohol wipes and that they would not move my case forward until that happened. I responded that I washed the Fitbit device with soap and water (it is supposed to be water resistant, after all), and that I had cleaned the charger by wiping it down with tissue paper. They would not accept and insisted that I needed to find alcohol wipes, without considering it was around midnight already. I lied and told them the hotel provided me with alcohol wipes just to get my case moving (I tried the alcohol wipes later and it didn't resolve the issue).Fitbit customer service agreed to replace my device because it was under warranty (within one year of purchase). I was given the option to either get a replacement for free or buy a different device from their website with a 50% discount. I opted to get a replacement, since this was still the newest Charge. They confirmed receiving my request shortly after.It has been 11 days (9 business days) since I requested a replacement, and I have not gotten any updates. I called customer service, and they said my case has not been reviewed. They said to wait another 5-7 business days after my call for an email update - just an update! I asked about the timeline for me to get a replacement, and they could not give me one! I asked why it had not been reviewed in the 11 days since my request, and they were not able to give an answer. I asked if there was any way to expedite the process, and the representative said that the case was already expedited, which I find hard to believe.There seems to be a lot of complaints online about how slow and frustrating it is for Fitbit to process warranty claims. This may be incompetence in their customer service, or they are getting a flood of warranty claims for a defective product, or both! Whatever the case may be, I regret buying this watch!Otherwise, the mobile app and the device itself have limited features without a premium subscription (as other reviews have pointed out). In terms of sleep tracking, it is overly sensitive of detecting light sleep even when I am awake in bed. Before breaking down, I had issues getting notifications on my device too."
740,Cash,1,the United States ,28-Sep-21,NO MORE ALTIMETER!!!! WHY?!,"1) THEY REMOVED THE ALTIMETER (stair tracker)I was starting to love the extra data features until I started looking for my flights climbed… and it’s gone! It no longer tracks your flights climbed! Which, as an avid Hiker, is extremely important to me! I’m returning it and going back to my charge 2. (And YEA, it’s returnable, they accepted and refunded me)The only reason I keep Fitbit even though I have an Apple Watch is bc the altimeter, battery and sleep tracking are superior to apple. However, now that they removed the altimeter I just can’t justify keeping the 5!!!!2) I don’t like that you can’t customize the colors of the different watch faces. I don’t want bright neon colors on my wrist in order to see all the stats on the main screen.3) I upgraded from the 2, so I’m not sure when this charged, but I don’t like that I have to now use the watch to set my silent alarms instead of just busting the Fitbit app. It takes so much longer to set up.4) the side bars are finicky, sometimes they don’t register that you’re pressing them while taking ecg reading.5) the screen scratches VERY easily!Conclusion: all in all, if it had an altimeter I would have kept it; if they bring it back on the 6, I’ll buy that. My favorite workout is stair climbing and hiking, so the altimeter is important to me.Original 9/27/21 It took over 3 hours to finally finish the update. It kept stopping midway through. Going to sync or change the clock face and it keeps saying connection lost non-stop. I’ve already reset and reconnected everything. My only guess is that they rolled out the charge 5 without the app being ready for it? Not sure but super annoying to (4 hours later) still not be able to complete set up"
741,Amazon Shopper,1,the United States ,5-Oct-22,Advanced Features Do Not Work,"This device is garbage when I first received the device the GPs never worked correctly for biking.  It would track my runs fine but would not track biking at all.  Sometimes it would try to track but stop at 0.3 miles and show me as 0.0mph.  I went to the forums first to try and resolve this problem.  One solution was to uncheck the auto tracking for biking activity.  I did this without avail.  I did keep it because I still wanted step counter and to track Peloton activity.  I was a little frustrated because I had the same problem with the Versa.Fast forward a few more months and the screen was completely blank.  Tried to reset using the three buttons on the charging cable which did not work.  The screen was never very accurate at knowing when to turn on.After this it became useless, so I reached out to customer service.  They wanted a video of me trying to restart the device with the support number in the background.  I told them I was having trouble emailing it to myself because of the size of video.  They cut me off chat.  Had to log back in and sent a photo with the customer support case number.  They said photo was good, but they needed video.  Finally got a short video of me pushing the button three times and the screen still black, but the support does not take the video format from an iPhone.So, I was like whatever.  I had an old Fitbit for years that worked fine but both the Versa and Charge 5 never had working GPS for bike rides and were just not good technology.  Customer service experience was super weird.  They never asked for a product number, but just wanted a video of the device malfunctioning, seemed like juts a way for them to not be accountable to their product.  If they suspect lying have me send the device back to them and then replace if it is malfunctioning.  Will not be buying Fitbit again, I advise you save your money."
742,FK,1,the United States ,1-Mar-22,"Fitbit Charge 5 great sports tracker, Fitbit warranty very lacking/slow, purchase from Amazon","I still think the Fitbit Charge 5 is the best tracker, Fitbit's warranty customer svc is lacking, and Amazon's warranty is great.  My family all prefer Apple iWatches, but the Fitbit Charge 5 (and previously Charge 2, 3, 4) are the best watch for me after trying many.  The fitbit batteries lasts almost a week (the Apple iWatches last a day or 1.5 days before requiring charging).  I prefer the shape/size of the Fitibit Charge 5 also.  The Fitbit sleep app is superior to the Apple iWatch std and add ins that I found/used.  The last Fitbit Charge 5 I ordered (via Amazon thank) didn't work (right out of the box after charging), and I'm sure that is/was an exception - my families & friends fitbits (many) have been perfect.  But for this exception (bad screen), Fitbit's ""chat"" support was lacking - had me ""keep attempting to synch"" over a weekend ""...to get a patch"", and ""...contact us in 2 days.."".  On the next Monday after asking for video's of the screen, and a few additional attempts to reboot/change screen were unsuccessful, Fitbit support confirmed the Charge 5 needed to be replaced.  They emailed me Q's that had already been answered 2 or 3 times by phone.  then, Fitbit emailed with their timeframe - they would have me ship the watch back, and after they received it, they would ship me a new Fitbit Charge 5.  Their timeframe was up to...., 24 calendar days from when I reported the issue.  I chose to let Amazon replace it - had a new watch in 2 days.  Still think Fitbit Charge 5 is the best for me, but I'm 100% sure Fitbit's warranty process is ripe for ""leaning"" and making customer centric.  Hat's off to Amazon for their lean/quick processes and amazing warranty response.Update - the Fitbit Charge 5 failed (2nd failure) after 6.5 months - the green heart rate monitor light came on solid and won't go off.  Took qty 3 chats working with Fitbit's crazy terrible customer svc team.  Unbelievable.  No customer svc claims by email.  Chat or by phone.  When you chat - if they ask you for a photo or video, or other, and it takes over a minute...., they can (and did in my case - twice) disconnect.  If you need a replacement device - be prepared to waited 21 to 24 calendar days.  Fitbit has the worlds worst customer service.  PCMag says the Fitbit Charge 5 is a good/great product, and other articles that compare it to Garmin say the Charge 5 is the better tracker/watch - but....., my conclusion is - if you are like me - and you want to be sure you have a watch/tracker available..., you will have to purchase qty 2 of these Charge 5's - one to use, the other one being replaced (very slowly) by Fitbit."
743,MoxyGirl,1,the United States ,27-Oct-22,died after 5 months and Fitbit fought me when I asked for it to be replaced,"Fitbit customer service was terrible. After owning a Surge (had to be replaced once because the band fell off the watch, another replacement when the red dot of death appeared, then they discontinued...), then a Charge 4 (had to replace once when it died), then decided to try Charge 5 when it was on sale. It died after 5 months. I am a very average user who makes sure I follow care instructions, so it's not that I'm hard on watches. I checked to see if I could fix on the Fitbit community support site. Didn't work, so I called to see if they could help. Multiple calls, some were disconnected/hang ups on their end. Finally tried Twitter. They requested all sorts of evidence (fine, I wasn't lying so was able to take pics of the watch with the code they told me to include with pic...took a video, too). They sent a link, I submitted for a replacement. Can't believe how hard I had to work and how much time it took for me to PROVE to Fitbit that my watch was dead. Then, I specifically told them that I was leaving the country and needed it to arrive before I left or 1) it would be left at an empty house and likely stolen or destroyed by bad weather and 2) be a signal to all passing house that I was clearly not there. I made this clear via email, phone, Twitter, and guess what? They told me that replacements cannot be expedited, only purchases. WTF, Fitbit? What current customer wants to wait weeks to get a replacement watch? Anyway, the watch arrived the day after I left for Africa. They didn't give a rip at all about me as a customer. I like the watch when it works, but I will not support the company by buying any other products from them."
744,CD Carter,1,the United States ,10-Jun-22,This is my 4th Fitbit and it is the worst by far,"I LOVED my Charge 3.  It was my favorite, but after 3+ years, it died and Fitbit didn't sell it anymore.  The support person said the Charge 5 was the closest to it so I bought it from Amazon.  I use it as my alarm clock and couldn't wait for it to arrive from them, Amazon got it to me the next day.First problem was trying to set it up.  During the setup we had to do a reset twice and were chatting with support for over two hours.  Never need them for set-up except for when I got the Charge  3 and gave the previous model to my husband.This device has more things than I need.  I can't take them off the Fitbit, so I have scroll through them all the time.  Not a big deal, but annoying to waste battery and time to scroll through things I don't want.The real issue is that since the initial setup on April 19th, I keep losing the alarms.  I've deleted them, I've done resets/restarts/updates, but it keeps happening.  Sadly, this morning was the last straw, but my window to return the device was last month.  I should have gone with my gut and sent it back the first week, but I was hoping it was just my learning curve.  Instead, what I'm seeing now is that this is a known issue with many different ways of trying to fix.  The problem is that you don't know if it is actually fixed until all of the sudden, it isn't.  Last night, my 8:00 alarm went off.  This morning, the 3:00am and 3:05 alarms did not.  Yet, when I look at the alarms, they appear to be set fine.The photo was to show the tech another problem that happens once in a while (keep in mind I've had this for less than 8 weeks).  Sometimes it gets stuck in a partial swipe.  The time is still accurate, but it is locked.  You can see the ""0"" is cut in half.  The only way to fix it is to turn it off and on.As much as I've loved the previous Fitbit models I've had, I LOATHE this one.  I actually bought a 3 year warranty for this one and I am not going to make it 3 months.  I've decided I'm either going to get a Charge 3 from Walmart or I'm getting an Apple watch.  I'm done with this thing.  Biggest waste of $175 (including the warranty) ever."
745,Brock H,1,the United States ,7-Aug-22,Extremely Inaccurate Mileage from GPS,"I purchased this for my wife as a gift.  We walk a lot and she wanted her own fitness watch.  I selected the Charge 5 based on a number of very positive reviews both on Amazon and other independent websites.  For us the most important feature would be the accuracy & consistency of the GPS because this is a real motivator for us.Pros-- She loved the look and feel - and comfortable to wear.- It has a built in GPS so it's not necessary to carry a smartphone while using it to measure distance. BUT see below.- There are many different watch faces available from the FitBit app.- It's possible to remove unwanted exercise modes and add others by using the FitBit website.  This makes it easier to use.- It has an adequate smartphone app and website for consolidating and storing fitness data.  I'm rating it only a 3 because, while perfectly adequate if the watch functions properly, it doesn't have nearly the level of detail & depth of the Garmin app.Cons -- WORST Problem (and ""deal killer"" for us- we're returning it) - extremely inaccurate GPS.  We walk a measured mile.  Her readings the last 4 times were 1.14, 1.32, 1.12 & 1.31 miles.  My Garmin Fenix 6 reported 1.01 miles on those same 4 days.  Digging further into actual user comments the inaccurate GPS was frequently mentioned as was the inability of FitBit support to offer any solutions other than where to wear it on the wrist or how tight the wristband should be.- Difficult to read some small display readings - such as battery life (we have old eyes) - especially in sunlight.- Touch screen wasn't always responsive.NOTE - if the GPS were accurate, the other Cons would have been acceptable given the price, comfort and other functions.  To replace it we bought a Garmin Forerunner 55 - similar apps although more expensive.  The Forerunner 55's GPS accurately measures distance and gives the same consistent readings as my Fenix 6.  There are other things she prefers about the Forerunner, but given the price and style differences, comparing the FitBit Charge 5 to the Garmin wouldn't be an apples to apples comparison."
746,Renee Rondeau,2,the United States ,22-Jul-22,Accurate at times; laughably erroneous at others. How to tell the difference?,"The Fitbit Charge5 offers a host of body measurements to help you keep healthy, but many are experimental or poorly measured, leaving considerable doubt about their utility. In some ways this “watch” is a step backward, as my 20-year-old Casio shows me the time (date and elevation) continuously (no need to tap the Casio to see the display), is easily read in bright sunlight (good luck with the Fitbit), is waterproof, and it never needs charging.  What the Fitbit adds is motion detection (it counts the swinging of your arms as you walk and calls them “steps”) and heartbeat rate (measured optically from the periodic widening of your arteries). Walking is really good for you, especially as you age, as it maintains bone density and promotes blood flow and healing. Couch potatoes impair their health, especially over the long run; the Fitbit might motivate you to keep moving to keep healthy. The main flaw in this device is that it treats almost any arm motion as equivalent to walking. I get hundreds or even thousands of “steps” from arm motions when I’m not walking; for example, grating cheese, or varnishing boards. Driving on some dirt roads are often credited as “steps”. In aggregate, my Charge5 has awarded me 15,000 “steps” in a single day for activities that I did without shaking a leg.  But what really sticks in my craw is the Fitbit’s misreading of heartbeats. How do I know that it is a misreading? After all, I can easily see the number of steps I take in a day, but heartbeats are not so readily counted. I set the Charge5’s screen to one of the choices that allows me to see the heartbeat rate anytime I turn the screen on; then over many weeks I repeatedly bicycled two 5+ mile rides, one on pavement and the other a gravel road. Both include 10% grades, uphill and down, and I took note of the reported heartbeat rate. Much of the time the graphs shown in the Fitbit app corresponded to what I observed throughout the ride, but occasionally the graphs were wildly in error. I reported the problem to Fitbit and they unhesitating gave me a new watch, but the new watch makes the same mistakes. I conclude that their sensors are just not up to the task.  Fitbit groups heartbeat rates into four classes, which correspond closely with my physical exertions: 1) resting, 2) active but not breathing hard (e.g. walking on the flats: Fitbit calls this “fat burning”), 3) breathing vigorously (pedaling steeply uphill; Fitbit calls it the “cardio” zone), and 4) gasping for breath (working harder than my body can sustain: “peak”). “Fat-burning” is mildly beneficial for cardiac conditioning and therefore Fitbit awards 1 “zone-minute” for each actual minute spent with a heartbeat that is 40-59% of the way from one’s personal minimum (measured from your resting rate) to one’s personal maximum (calculated from your age). “Cardio” is the zone above that, 60-84% of the way from your personal minimum to your personal maximum, and peak is the zone above 84%. The Charge5 awards you 2 “zone-minutes” for each minute you spend above 60%, but it notes that time spent above 84% can be damaging to your body and therefore should be entered only occasionally. For example, from hundreds of measurements of my heartrate I know that at the top of 10% grades on my bicycle, I sometimes enter the “peak” (=>84%) zone, but as the incline eases off I rapidly return to the unequivocally beneficial “cardio” zone. The core function of the Charge5 is the game of accumulating zone-minutes through vigorous activity. The watch has innumerable cheery messages that it sends you whenever you are accumulating zone-minutes, and it gently chides you every hour that you fail to do so. Here are some examples of how badly the Charge5 measures heartrate. I was driving through a calm residential neighborhood to go bicycling, parked, strapped on my Charge5, and stepped out of the car, when the Fitbit congratulated me on earning cardio zone-minutes (in reality, I would not have yet even entered fat-burning). On my daily 30 minute ride on gravel, my Fitbit once calculated that I averaged 150 beats per minute (BPM) over the entire 30 minutes, when experience with that exact ride shows that I only occasionally exceed 120 bpm for a minute or two. For my age, 150 bpm is considered the maximum heartrate I can achieve; to sustain that for 30 minutes would presumably kill me. I have personally never seen a credible instantaneous measurement of >135 bpm. I could push that hard, but I would be gasping for air, and I’m too old for that for any length of time. To average >150 bpm for 30 min is simply unimaginable. Almost every night, one of the two bpm graphs (the zone-minutes graph) shows me reaching cardio (and sometimes peak) when I am sound asleep.  I mentioned before that the Fitbit misreads arm motions as steps, but it also misreads arm motions as heartbeats. My Charge5 has repeatedly attributed cheese grating or painting as zone-minutes in the cardio or even “peak” ranges, when in reality I did not have even mildly elevated breathing.  One infuriating example of misreading heart beats is to be found in the discrepancies between the two heartbeat graphs found in the Fitbit app. One is located under the zone-minutes sub-screen; the other under the heartbeat sub-screen. Both purport to show your heartbeat rate throughout the day, and the curves are mostly similar, but the numbers do not agree. I frequently see one graph (the zone-minutes one) that is 40 bpm higher than the other. Unfortunately, the errors are not consistent; I think it depends on the frequency of the arm jiggling that seems to produce the errors. Sometimes the bumps on a washboard gravel road is just the right frequency and the heartbeat rate is error-free; at other times the reported heartbeat is up to double the actual elevation above resting bpm.  Note that all of the errors inflate the number of zone-minutes earned by a particular activity. Perhaps Fitbit finds these errors tolerable because users enjoy the flattery.  Based on my experience, I have the following recommendations to avoid erroneous heartrate measurements. If you are doing an activity regularly, exercise while observing the instantaneous heartbeat rate, and note the typical value for each part of the activity, and then ignore the daily graphs that are wildly different. Do not use the GPS tracking feature unless you really need it; use of the GPS precludes you from seeing instantaneous measurements, and every time I use the GPS I get some huge errors. Be skeptical of any measurements taken from a gravel or rough road; four-wheeling produces a lot of bogus steps and heartbeats. Wear a long-sleeved shirt over your Charge5, as it will dampen jiggles that produce bogus heartbeats.  Wear your Charge5 only on your non-dominant hand (left for right-handers). If there is a discrepancy between the two graphs in the Fitbit app, defer to the lower values (usually on heartrate sub-screen).  With those caveats, the Charge5 has some useful measurements: the sleeping temperature feature is purported to be diagnostic for detecting long-covid, for example (though you need a long string of measurements prior to and after getting covid). And it you cherish a dog that loves you because you feed it, you may find solace in the Charge5’s regular messages of encouragement for each time you earn a zone-minute. If you care about the accuracy of those zone-minute measurements, you might want to consider another choice."
747,John Collins,2,the United States ,5-Aug-22,So much potential,"Tl;dr The Charge 5 could be great, but fitbit won't allow it and the measurements are very suspect for me.The Charge 5 has a lot of potential, however, Fitbit has crippled the device, and the application.  For starters, the sensors.  The Charge 5 has both an SpO2 sensor and a body temperature sensor.  However, the device doesn't make full use of them.  You cannot take a real-time SpO2 reading or temperature reading.  You can't even access the information in the app or online account.  SpO2 is given as high and low averages which isn't helpful at all.  You don't have a reference percentage so the averages really don't provide useful information.  The same goes for the temp readings.  The application only tells you fluctuations in your average temperature, but not what the actual reading is.  To top it off, the measurements are only taken when you're asleep which is useless for fitness tracking.  The ability to still actual data, and take real-time on-demand measurements would vastly improve the usefulness of the device.Sleep tracking isn't accurate for me.  It consistently records time awake as either light sleep or rem sleep.  There were a few nights where I was in bed awake, TAKING AN ECG READING OR USING THE FITBIT APP and the following morning the device registered that time as being in either light sleep or deep sleep.  If the device can't differentiate between being actively used and the user being asleep it makes a lot of the other sleep readings suspect.  There are also times during the night when I've awoken, gotten out of bed for awhile and returned and they're not logged as time being awake.  I've tried to adjust the sleep sensitivity and it makes no difference.  If I am in bed reading before going to sleep the device will track the inactive period between getting into bed and falling asleep as actually being asleep.  To its credit it does show it as being restless sleep, but still inaccurately recorded as being asleep.The EDA sensor feature requires the user to pinch the sides of the Charge 5 for 3 minutes in order to take a reading.  That's a really long time when you're trying to pinch something that small and hold still.  By the end of every scan my fingers and/or wrist were cramped.  The device must be worn while scanning so holding it comfortably in your hand isn't an option.The mobile application is confusing to navigate.  It shows metrics on a dashboard, which may be helpful for some users, but in order to find detailed information you have to dig around for it.  The settings are not intuitive and there are an extremely limited amount of options for clock faces, about 24 of them.  There is no real app support for the device, only the handful of fitbit branded apps that are available through the app. The fitbit SDK doesn't support the Charge series so creating your own apps or clock faces isn't an option.There are a few 3rd party mobile applications (for Android at least, not sure about iPhone) that allow you to collect and analyze your data in much more meaningful ways, but still are not very helpful.  To their credit Fitbit does allow users to download their raw data from their account, but in doing so I've noticed that a lot of data is missing.  Sleep data is hit or miss, as is heart rate data.  This is doing a complete archive export and viewing the json files, so the data should be there, but isn't.  I can see it on the app, and in my account dashboard so it exists, but just isn't being provided.Activity tracking isn't very accurate.  I bike to work every day and most days those commutes are not tracked unless I manually tell the device that I'm about to start a biking workout.  The minimum length of time that can be set for auto-tracking activities is 10 minutes with the default being 15.  If I am pedaling fast, or not slowed down by traffic, my bike commute can be less than 10 minutes.  But even when going for a ride in the evening that lasts an hour or more the device doesn't always track that I'm biking.  When activities are not tracked it affects the daily readiness score, which looks are previous activities, combined with sleep, to calculate how ready for the day you are.  Lacking actual data on activities, and suspect sleep tracking data, the readiness score is rather meaningless.This may be an accurate device for some people, but for me it just isn't.  The fact that fitbit intentionally cripples devices and makes analyzing your own data incredibly difficult suggests that maybe this isn't the best company to buy a product from if you want to be in control of what you see.  That may be fine for some users.  I'll be returning the Charge 5 because it doesn't meet my needs and isn't very well supported.  Perhaps I'll try the Versa 3 or Sense since they are better supported, but the lack of data analyses tools is a big impediment to taking the devices seriously."
748,Evan,2,the United States ,12-Oct-22,Startlingly Inaccurate Tracking,"I'll try to keep this brief and I'll start with a disclaimer: there's a chance the Fitbit Charge 5 I received was just a dud. I returned it to Amazon but I'm not planning on buying another based on my experience, even if I did just have a defective unit.The heart rate tracking just isn't good enough for the kind of exercise I do on a daily basis. I imagine more casual users who do steady-state cardio occasionally will be served just fine by the Charge 5, but that just isn't me. My favorite types of workouts involve HIIT and Interval runs, Peloton's Walk+Run classes, and strength training. For those types of workouts, the Charge 5 was simply an unreliable disaster.The first time I did a HIIT run wearing the Charge, I was just confused and frustrated because every time I looked down to check my heart rate (already knowing it had to be peaking because of how I felt) it would be nowhere close to the number I expected. To confirm my suspicion, I started doing workouts wearing the Charge 5 with either the Peloton heart rate monitor or my Apple Watch series 7. After doing some strength classes, and more interval work, I confirmed with data what I had suspected: the Charge 5 can not accurately measure heart rates that change quickly.The reading on the Fitbit was always a couple minutes behind where I actually was, or it was just far off from my true heart rate (usually reading much lower--at times around 40 bpm off). I tried changing wrists, adjusting the fit, and even a hard reset. On dog walks the tracking seemed to be much more accurate, but as someone who wants to track actual exercise and not just casual, everyday walks, this doesn't win the Charge 5 any points. If it can't reliably track my heart rate while I do the exercises I love to do, the tracker is useless to me. That means that it's not accurately calculating calories burned, and the data will be useless to me over time to track trends. I like to repeat certain HIIT runs or strength classes to see how I'm improving over time. I can't do that with data from the Charge 5 because the data was reliably incorrect.I also have a bone to pick with the daily readiness score Fitbit provides. I've been wearing an Oura ring gen 3 for 10 months every day. It knows me well, and I trust its own readiness scores when it comes to accuracy and reliability. For the week plus change that I tested the Charge 5, I had the Fitbit app tell me multiple days in a row that my readiness score was at a 1. Out of 100. Essentially advocating that I stay bedridden to recover. On those same days, my Oura readiness score was in the high 80s, which accurately reflected how I felt and how I trained on those days. The Fitbit was telling me I was exhausted beyond movement, and the Oura was telling me to go ahead full-steam. I listened to the Oura and was absolutely fine. I don't know if the Fitbit daily scores get better over time, but I just don't see how my readiness score could have been so close to the absolute lowest score possible when in reality I felt great. Baffling, and useless considering that eventually it becomes a paid feature.Overall I'm just so disappointed. I don't understand how these things have a cult-like following. They just aren't accurate trackers. The data is wrong and often. How are you supposed to know how you're improving if you can't look at a workout and trust the data it collected? For me it defeats the entire purpose of a fitness tracker. So I sent it back assuming it was a lemon. But the whole experience was so sour that I won't be coming back for more."
749,Marc S.,2,the United States ,2-Sep-22,The sleep-tracking is great. If only the whole product were as good as this.,"So I am looking at this product through a specific lens: as a possible Apple Watch replacement. I lost my Apple Watch, and thought maybe I could replace it with a device that offered me a longer battery life in exchange for many features I would not miss (I really don’t need the weather forecast on my wrist).So, here is the great:The battery lasts at least 5 days (I never let it run down all the way, so I do not know the full battery life). This is great. Unlike with my Apple Watch, which needed a charge by the end of every day, I can wear the Fitbit to sleep, and get sleep tracking data. Great. Huge. Very helpful. And this is worth the price of admission.The good:It’s a Fitbit, so naturally it does a great job hunting steps, reminding me to move, etc. As a GPS for recording bike rides, it does an adequate job, although it doesn’t seem quite as accurate as the Apple Watch’s. But whatever.The disappointing:Unlike my Apple Watch, it does not have the low-power always-on screen mode, so if I need to tell the time, it needs to sense me wrist twist.  It successfully senses the wrist twist about 25% of the time. So, as a conventional time-telling watch, it’s pretty poor. Here’s a small one: like the Apple Watch, if I need to locate my phone, it has the feature to “find” the phone by making it sound. But unlike the Apple Watch’s version, which just works, the Fitbit’s works about a third of the time. Usually it reports that the watch is not nearby, even though it then turns out to be within arms’ length.The annoying: As a matter of policy, it will not send to Strava workouts that do not include GPS data. So, if I workout on the treadmill and with weights, etc, the Fitbit records a workout with heart rate data that I can view as a workout in the Fitbit app, but since there is no GPS data, it will not upload it to Strava. People post indoor workouts, stationary bike rides, etc to Strava all the time.  But not with a Fotbit apparently.The confounding:As I understand it, if the Fitbit loses connectivity with my phone during a workout, it will stop logging GPS data for the entire workout?So for example, if I want to run laps and I start the workout near my bag, which has my phone in it, and then during the course of running, unexpectedly go out of range of my bag (who could possibly see that coming?), the Fitbit records the workout without GPS data. This, you guessed it, makes it unwilling to upload this workout to Strava, of course. Sure, makes sense. I guess?The deal-breaker:Playing soccerRoad bikingShoweringSleepingReaching for something in a pants pocketCrossing my armsLooking at the timeWhat do all of these activities have in common? All of them have caused the Fitbit to fall off of my wrist.  The mechanism that connects the Fitbit to the wrist strap is not ready for public consumption. It is flimsy at best. I am told by my Fitbit-loving friend that this is an anomaly and I should send it back. I will.The verdict: This feels like a product that has successfully completed beta testing, but not much more that that.This does not feel like a product mature enough to have a 5 as part of its name.I am returning this device and will most likely get a new Apple Watch, and look for a small, unobtrusive companion device for sleep tracking. Blech."
750,Geezer the Geek,2,the United States ,8-Oct-22,"Terrible Customer Support, frequently won't connect, inaccurate heart rate","I owned every Fitbit Charge model since they first came out, but the Charge 5 will be my last. I have three major complaints:Terrible Customer Support: The screen on my Charge 5 died. Fitbit Customer Service said I needed to send them a video of the Charge 5 showing the dead screen.  Then after I created a video and emailed it, I got no response from Fitbit. I called back and was told that they couldn't view the video I sent because it was too big to be sent as an attachment and was sent as a link to a file on Google. Apparently, Fitbit restricts reps from accessing Google stored files. I was told that the case would be escalated but several days later after hearing nothing from Fitbit, I called back. I was told that I had to send in a video as an email attachment before Fitbit would consider the claim. I was quite upset at that point as I explained the problem. The Fitbit rep threatened to hang up on me because she said I was shouting, even though my language was civil. Still the bottom line with the rep was that I had to send in a video as an attachment before my warranty request would be considered. I made another video, this time only 20 seconds long but the file size still exceeded the 25 MB limit required to be sent as an email attachment. So I downloaded a video editing program, learned how to use it, and was able to reduce the resolution of the 20 second video file so that it was within the 25 MB that could be sent as an email attachment.  After all of that trouble, I got an email that my replacement request had been approved and I later received my warranty replacement. One of the worst customer experiences I've ever had with a company.Frequently the Charge 5 stops connecting to the app.  It has gone several days without connecting. The last time after a week of not connecting, I did everything I could think of to get it to reconnect, but it would not connect. I turned Bluetooth off/on, removed/added the device to the app, and tried connecting  with my tablet instead of my phone. Nothing worked. It finally reconnected after I uninstalled/reinstalled  the app. Right now, as I'm writing this review, I again can't get the Charge 5 to connect to any of my devices, which prompted me to write this review.Finally, there is the problem with the heart rate accuracy. Sometimes, it is accurate, as I have compared the HR measured by the Charge 5 to a chest strap monitor, but it is frequently much lower than the chest strap monitor. I've found that both Garmin and Polar have more accurate wrist HR monitors than the Charge 5. HR accuracy has always been a problem with the Charge models, and I expected it to improve with the Charge 5 but it has not.I'm not sure what my next fitness tracker will be but it will certainly not be a Fitbit."
751,Kyle Gonyea,2,the United States ,23-Nov-22,Be sure to check your battery regularly!,"Charge 5 seems to be a step up in many ways. The display is actually visible which is a big change over the Charge 4, however, the battery just dies with no warnings and that is super annoying. Went for a walk today and realized after I started that my Fitbit was completely dead. There are no notifications or indications when the battery gets low so if you don't plug it in every couple of days it will die and you won't know until it happens. Apple Watch would have been a much better purchase but I thought I'd give Fitbit a try again since I like the smaller footprint. Step count and exercise tracking isn't much better than the Charge 4 was and often fails to recognize exercise or has the wrong durations if it does track it. As always, the sleep tracking is pretty worthless. It gives you a general idea of how the night went but of course there are no suggestions or any way to improve your score so I'm not sure what a person is supposed to do with that information. Mobile app still has lots of trouble syncing data and generally takes at least a couple of tries."
752,jacob,2,the United States ,26-Oct-21,"Heartrate Monitor, GPS tracker and 02 sensor are inaccurate","Dang, was really sad about this one.I started doing some tests when I noticed that the heart rate monitor was reading 90 bpm 10 seconds after reading 160 and then it would go to 140. So, I grabbed a couple of my friends who have the charge 5 and we all have several of the chest rap style heart rate monitors that are proven to be much more accurate than ones that go on the wrist. We tested them out by comparing bpm, steps, 02 sensor and gps distancing. We only found the total steps to be accurate. The rest were wildly inaccurate.So, I compared this one to several chest heart rate monitors and found that the higher your heartrate, the more inaccurate it becomes. 60-110 BPM and I found the fitbit was roughly 80% accurate and at 110-150 it was about 60% accurate and at 150 plus it was about 50% accurate. It could read high or low. Meaning if your heartrate was 160 then the fitbit would randomly read anywhere from 80 to 195... So, as far as the validity of the heart rate monitor. I give it 1/5. This also means that all parts of the app that use your heart rate as an assessment parameter are completely inaccurate. The Health Metrics, the bpm and the calories burned features etc. They are not accurate and cannot be relied on. They are actually wildly inaccurate. At one point I had three fitbit charge 5 on and I had one reading in the 180's, another at 80 and another at 90. The chest monitors had me at 160... Sometimes they would read fairly close for about a minute and then they would do this weird thing where they raised or dropped your heartrate. After googling it, I am not the only one with these problems.The GPS, It is pretty good if you have it connected to your phone gps. But, if you use the watches gps, it is wildly inaccurate as well. Plus or minus 20%. I tested this out by walking 2 miles with 2 separate fitbit charge 5's on. They both had significantly different numbers. The steps feature was pretty accurate though.Also, I noticed that the tighter the wrist strap was, the less accurate the gps was. the looser the wrist strap and then the heart rate monitor became less accurate. You have to actually choose which feature will be the most accurate. It reminds me of the old iphones that lost signal when you held them in your hands.The 02 sensor is pretty much worthless sadly. Compared to real medical ones, you could be off by several %. which makes them worthless.The sleep monitor? I couldn't think of an easy way to test that. I doubt it is accurate at all.Overall, I do not recommend this product. The only feature that was accurate can be done with most smart phones without buying a fitbit. All three of us returned ours and found fitbit's customer service extremely difficult to deal with. Amazon was super easy and very helpful. Full refunds on all 3."
753,Sue D. Nym,2,the United States ,29-Sep-22,Key running metrics unusable because of gps inaccuracy,"I purchased this fitbit in July 2022 with hopes that would help me get in shape after several years of medical issues.  I'm now on week 8 of the couch-to-5k, and I started turning on the running activity on my jogs to establish a baseline for starting to get faster.You can see from the screenshots just how wildly inaccurate the gps can be.  All 3 runs (taken during the same week) were on an earthen dam in a park near my house - a narrow path, completely devoid of trees or other structures that could interfere with the gps.  The middle run erroneously shows me running all over the place, off of the dam! It therefore recorded a much higher distance, and thus an unbelievable increase in pace.  But since I didn't see the gps map until I logged into the fitbit app later, I briefly thought that I had experienced a miraculous improvement.  :-)A quick search on fitbit forums revealed that the unreliable gps is a known issue with the charge 5; that even wearing the strap too tight can prevent the gps from working (although wearing it too loose apparently causes inaccurate heart rate readings).I'm around 2 weeks beyond the (45-day?) return window, so I'm stuck with a fitness tracker that can't help me measure progress with my running.  If I figure out how to contact fitbit, I'll see if they can help me get a functional tracker."
754,Honest Kind Critic,2,the United States ,28-Aug-22,Potential but with frustrating issues,"Good concept and app. Poor execution.Versa 2 was gifted to me but did not record my stationary bike riding accurately.I ordered the Charge 5 hoping it would rectify the issues, but not to date, even when consulting forums.Issue: when I “spin” (putting the fitbit in “spin” mode) while on my bike, the BPM only works 25-50% of the time, even when I remove it from my wrist, try holding in palm for best results, etc. I clean the watch and band all the time following instructions suggested by the maker and on forums.Why is this important? My bike says I ride 30-50 miles a day. My fitbit says I go 6-10 miles even if I move my arm(s) to actually see step counts increment. Putting the watch in my pocket does not record any BPM and thus none of the telling “Active Zone” metrics—and the BPMs change hugely depending upon where the device touches my skin. Very frustrating to have to play games for accuracy.Why important? I am 61 and walk 5 miles a day at least as well and want to know if I am staying on target with my ambitious but important goals. I am in the shape of a person half my age and metrics help to motivate me and help me maintain my strict diet. Walking statistics seem more accurate, perhaps due to GPS.I also lift weights and use resistance bands an hour a day with great intensity and the fitbit does a poor job of tracking my stenuous workouts—often I see minimal caloric credit or any Active Zone minutes (even when putting watch in appropriate mode).Is there any solution by any fitbit or other device to record all physical activities more accurately?"
755,EF Renfro,2,the United States ,2-Oct-22,Worst Version,"I had the Charge 4 for almost 2 years and it was the most accurate and actually recorded information. This Charge 5 almost never picked up sleep activity, and never was accurate on anything else or didn’t work at all. The whole thing stopped working when it got wet the first time and the time changed to something inaccurate and couldn’t be fixed by troubleshooting so I trashed it once I was paying for all the analytics and wasn’t getting the info and the strap irritated my arm more than any others ever have. It lasted maybe 5-6 months whereas the Charge 4 lasted almost a year and a half and got wet and was still on point. I purchased the Charge 5 because I have had the previous fitbits to the Charge 4 and always had great experiences with them so this one being so bad really disappointed me. I’m thinking about writing the company directly. I purchased a different brand since that doesn’t compare to the Charge 4 in the slightest so I’m debating on going back to the Charge 4 but hate that it won’t have the upgrades the Charge 5 should have had. Don’t get the Charge 5 under any circumstances. Hopefully they will get their act together."
756,Ashes,3,the United States ,3-Nov-22,Good for most common uses but GPS connection is lacking.,"Edit: I ended up sending the device back because the GPS is so unreliable. Maybe there's another FItBit model with better GPS connectivity, but this particular one isn't going to work for me.This is an ever-evolving review which I am updating as I've had more time to learn and use this device. Here are my initial thoughts after about two weeks of use. And please keep in mind that I'm finally upgrading from my 1st Gen FitBit Surge, and the primary purpose for me having an exercise tracker is for running.Aesthetic: 5/5It has a nice low-profile design. I got the off-white gray-ish color because it's a little more feminine looking in my opinion.Weight/Size: 5/5Very lightweight. Of course the slim profile makes it fairly easy to wear long sleeves or a coat. I don't need a huge screen, so this model works well for me size-wise.Battery Life: 5/5I read where another user vouched for the week-long battery life, and while I haven't really put that to the test yet, I found that after at least 5 days of not being on the charging device, it was still going strong. Granted, I only wear it when exercising, or sometimes when I go out.Watchband: 5/5I like that they include both the small and large watchbands in the box. That's one less accessory you'd have to purchase separate. If you're used to wearing an Apple Watch or something with a silicone band, then you'll be fine with this one. I can't stand having ANYTHING on my wrists, even nice jewelry, so it's definitely not something I wear unless I'm using the device for a specific purpose.Display: 5/5Nice display. Not much else to say about that.Functionality: Hard to say at this point how I would rate the overall functionality since many of the features are completely extraneous to me. I'm a runner, so I really just bought this for tracking my distance and occasionally checking in to see what kind of times I'm running. Here is my breakdown on functionality:>> Touch Screen: 3/5Not extremely impressed with the touch screen but it could be that I just haven't had time to calibrate my brain to it. It's a little finicky for me, and I thought that would improve when I took the screen cover off (BTW the screen cover was an item I purchased separately), but that has not really been the case. This is especially irritating when I'm running and need to be able to easily start and stop the clock.>>GPS: 3/5I have noticed that my FitBit Surge was telling me that the loop that I run around my neighborhood is right at 2 miles. However, the Charge 5 is telling me that my loop is actually closer to 2.25 miles. I'm inclined to believe the results of the more recent model since the technology has had like eight years to advance between the two devices. I did notice that it had trouble connecting to GPS one day, but it was also overcast. While doing an internet search about FitBit products and GPS connectivity issues, people are saying their FitBits have trouble connecting in certain environmental conditions (overcast skies being one of them). If you live in the middle of a big city with lots of tall buildings, you should expect to have connectivity issues as well. We live out in the suburbs of Huntsville, AL so we don't have that issue.  Today was not overcast at all, and I started running. GPS was working fine but I had to hit Pause to correct a wardrobe malfunction. Took about 20 seconds, and in that time, I lost GPS connection. Not sure if it thought I was finished, or if it just likes to stay in motion, but when I looked back at my screen, it said GPS connection was lost. So I would have had to start a whole new GPS connection, which is just a giant pain the @$$ when you're already mid-run. I'm really really trying to give this thing an honest shot before scrapping it, but so far I'm not thoroughly impressed. If anyone has any helpful tips for me, please feel free to reply directly to my review.>>Run Feature:  My only real issue so far with this device's Run feature is that the touch screen is difficult to use sometimes, especially when running. Let's be honest, when I'm done with my run, I want to just be able to hit Stop and see my stats. Instead, I have to tap the screen and swish and swipe a few times until I get a screen with a Pause button. I really do miss having the external buttons for Start/Stop/Pause/Finish. That was a nice feature to have because I could get more accurate stats with zero frustration.>>Heart Tracker: I have yet to find a fitness tracker that can actually detect my subhuman heartbeat. It's like I put the device on, even if I have it on tight, and it thinks I'm dead. Granted, my resting heart rate is in the 30s, so when it gets UP to 40, it alerts me that my heart rate is too low. I don't necessarily fault the device for that, though. I think maybe the technology just isn't quite there yet for heart rates below 40 or 50.  But I will say that it does show me my average heart rate of about 157 bpm when I finish a run, and I believe that number is legitimate.I will update my review as I've had more time to use this device. Giving it some more time before I decide to scrap it and upgrade.  I'd love it if someone could tell me how to actually Stop the clock at the end of a run."
757,Alex,3,the United States ,27-Sep-21,"Half baked, expensive, accuracy issues? UPDATE: can be RETURNED just fine","UPDADE 4 (final):Fitbit introduced the recovery score as part of the premium service (means monthly fees). It’s not as good as I’d hoped. Very generic and seems to rely on resting heart rate and HRV only. It’s a bit of a disappointment. I am keeping the 3-star rating. There are better health monitors out there, but this one is well-rounded. (and priced) enough to be a contender.UPDATE 3: I am just going to sum things up after two weeks of use.PROs:*Great screen, can be easily viewed in very sunny conditions.*Great for working out. Provides extensive metrics as you work out and seems accurate.*Very good sleep tracking. Silent alarms (can be setup to avoid waking you up from a deep sleep).*Decent heart rate monitor. Step tracker. Calorie count, etc. All these inherent features work well.*Holds charge forever.CONs:*No recovery rate metrics, as promised by Fitbit yet.*The screen is blinding at night. No way to tone down the brightness.*No longer counts stairs climbed for some reason.*Does not have actual body temperature readings.I've learned how to estimate my recovery rate, based on resting heart rate, sleep quality and HRV. Still, wish that metrics was provided by Fitbit, as promised.UPDATE2: Look like they made the black version FULLY RETURNABLE for whatever reason, so buy in confidence.One more issue to report: the screen does not seem to have an ambient light sensor and the ""sleep mode"" does not automatically turn on. I find myself waking up in the middle of the night to a blinding screen that lights up the room. Not great!UPDATE1: some have mentioned problems with the device being non-returnable. I followed up with Amazon on the issue. It is returnable, IF you experience performance issues or the device itself is defective or otherwise problematic. It seems like all versions but Black are fully returnable, so it must be a glitch. Talk to Amazon, if you experience an issue. They are extremely helpful.I am now into the 4th day of testing and it looks like there is some calibration going on in the background, as readings are getting a bit more accurate. I wish the temperature sensor would provide nominal values instead of an evaluation on how much it changed from the day before. I hope Fitbit hurries up and releases the Readiness Score feature.These are my initial impressions and I will update this review, as my experience living with Charge 5 allows me to better evaluate it. I have and regularly use Biostrap and Apple Watch. I am mostly interested in my sleep and recovery data and Apple Watch doesn’t do any of that, while Biostrap is useless for tracking workout. You cannot have it all, apparently. I was hoping that this Charge 5 can reasonably handle both tasks in one device.To my great disappointment, Fitbit released Charge 5 without the promised Daily Readiness Score, which would basically indicate your recovery score after you wake up in the morning, telling you how your body is really doing, and whether you should go hard or easy on yourself for the rest of the day. It’s a great way to modulate your workouts and properly recover without overstressing your body. The Biostrap is excellent for that very reason (see some of my dashboard pics). That’s what I wanted out of this Fitbit and they didn’t deliver. There isn’t even a timeline for when the feature will be available.Another missing feature is the ECG, but I am neither here or there on that one. Charge 5 also no longer shows you how many stairs you've climbed, which is disappointing, since Charge 4 did. After using it for two days, I am noticing that sleep time recognition isn't accurate. My Biostrap gets it right, down to a minute, while Charge 5 can be off by hours.  Better turn it on yourself in the settings before bedtime.Speaking of settings are adjustments...the lack of physical buttons means that you'll be scrolling up/down/left/right on a small screen all day long. It can get frustrating and menus aren't all that logically laid out. Another things that's poorly laid out is the dashboard, which is supposed to give you a snapshot of your metrics at a glance. You have to go through multiple screens (and some are not easy to find) in the app to get to various points of data. All of that should be viewable on one screen. AND you must use the phone app to view detailed info. Most of it isn't available on the web interface.As it stand today, I would rather spend extra $20 and get an Apple Watch SE, which would be a superior tool in just about every respect until Fitbit delivers on the Daily Readiness Score. I’ll have to see how my experience with Charge 5 evolves, but I am giving it very generous 3 start for now…"
758,Dan Baxter,3,the United States ,12-Mar-22,Grumpy Coach and Salesman included with every purchase!,"Had to replace a FitBit Charge 3 (FB3) and FitBit Charge 5 (FB5) was $80 cheaper, so went with that figuring that improvements would be the majority of what I experienced. . . . surprise!!GOOD:  -  the time needed to update and sync between FB5 and app is almost instantaneous when the app is opened and is a great change - no more, ""hold, this is taking longer than expected"" and sometimes having to restart the process on the FB3  -  sleep tracking is much more consistent and in-depth with scores immediately available; it's even smart enough to know when you have taken a nap  -  the addition of an EKG like monitor is a nice function although I'm not sure how accurate it isNOT SO GOOD:  it feels like there's super annoying and judgmental life coach and salesman packed in there  -  Alarm function:  the FB3 snooze feature was simple: swipe to snooze and catch a few more minutes; with FB5: the ""tap"" feature to view the screen to access snooze or turn off features appears to be programmed to require a much stronger ""tap"" (aka ""you asked me to wake you up - I'm going to make you work for it!"").  Once you get to snooze and choose it, the alarm/vibrate function continues on for another 2-3 seconds prompting a gut check/stress moment of ""uh-oh, did I not touch the right button or did I actually set the snooze?"" (thanks for the use of stress and concern to help ""make sure"" that I get up at the time I asked for, Coach!"") and the ""sweet spot"" and strength of tap required to access the snooze/shut off feature after consecutive choices to snooze become more finite and you might feel like you have to punch it to be able to turn the alarm off  select ""turn off alarm"" and, of course, the alarm instantly stops (""Good job being responsible and getting up like we agreed!  You won't have to work to rest a little longer!"")  -  Being uber connected has it's ups and downs - including security and privacy concerns.  The Salesman in my FB5 somehow seems to have randomly programmed the system to buzz my wrist and make me look at a reminder on my screen that I should enter my credit card information so that I can use my FB5 at swipe or tap and pay retailers;  I chose not to give you that information when I set the app and device up, I don't need to be hounded about more ways to move money out of my wallet!  -  Be sure the charger is fully attached!  The FB3 had a charging cord with a plastic ""dock"" that you knew it was locked in and working because of the click and the change on screen to show that it was charging.  The FB5 has a magnet based charging interface about the size of the back of the FB5 and there is a right way (look to align the gold dots on the FB5 with the interface) and lots of opportunity to not get it right.  The magnet isn't designed to ""lock"" the FB5 in place for charging.  Charging happens via the back of the FB, which is surrounded by wristband - depending on style creating a risk of setting it down to charge and having the wristband press against the cord and dislodge the charger.  -  FB5 uses battery power more quickly than the FB3.  I could easily go about a week between FB3 charges.  The FB5 has a max of 4-5 days and takes much longer to recharge - to the tune of hours vs. 45 minutes to an hour starting from about 20% remaining charge.  -  ""water lock"" sounds like a good feature to have.  If you're thinking it's an extra layer of protection for your FB, it isn't!  Water lock is simply designed to change the sensitivity of the FB face and reduce it so that as you take a shower, the water beads don't inadvertently ""tap"" the screen and access the FB interactivity and do something you don't want.  Oh the irony of the sensitivity to water and the strength required to wake up!!  -  Introducing the FitBit Commander Fashionista!  Color choices for the FB5 wristband:  whatever the source store decides!  I had no other apparent choice than the ""Lunar White"" which was enough for a couple people to ask, ""What are you wearing?""  Score one for the Salesman in there!  Another $13.99 spent to move away from forced color ""choices"".  Unlike the FB3, there does appear to be many more materials, styles, and color choices for other wristbands if you don't get what you like."
759,Mark,3,the United States ,14-Apr-22,See my in-depth review below,"Some background info: I have been a triathlete for years. I have used Garmin devices half of my life and I track data most of the time such as running dynamics, cadence, and heart rate. I have prior history of using Fitbit watch for 2 years back around 2017-18. Now, I got the Charge 5 because I don’t want the bulkiness from the Sense because Charge 5 practically tracks the same thing as Sense (except a few things like the ABC so no stairs climbed will be measured). I tried Charge 5 for 3 days (including sleep and exercising) and one of the days I compared it side-by-side against a Garmin watch.My quick summary: it is an excellent fitness tracking band but if you crave for something more than just basic tracking, look elsewhere.Disclaimer: I tried it under free fitbit app because I wanted to see what I get from the free app since the membership price per year is outrageous (I am aware there is a 6-month free trial).Here is my in-depth analysis:Wear/appearance/design: I did like the charge 5 and its band. It is comfortable once you’ve adjusted to the correct area. I often forget I was wearing it most of the time. I have no problem wearing it overnight and no skin rash or anything after the 3rd day. I wear dress shirts during the day and it is slim and nicely hiding under my cuff. The display is vibrant and easy to read.All-day continuous heart rate tracking: Their 24/7 PurePulse tech records your rate every 5 minutes. Garmin does it every 2 min. When I was wearing my garmin + charge 5 together for 24 hours, I can see a big deviation between both devices. The RHR for fitbit says 54-55 for me and for Garmin (from years of history tracking me) says 46-48 RHR. The HR graph is also friendlier to read on Garmin than fitbit. There is also more HR fluctuation throughout the day seen from fitbit than Garmin (perhaps because it measures every 5 min?). All in all, it is a bit questionable for me here.EDA and ECG: I tried them but I don’t know if they are accurate. Even if they are not, it only tells me if I am sinus rhythm or not. I guess these are good features for individuals with heart concern or family hx of heart diseases.SpO2, Heart Rate Variability, breathing rate, and skin temp: Yes fitbit tracks them, but you cannot interact with/open the graph to see how you did throughout the night/day. Garmin tracks respiration, pulse-ox, HR, and stress in real-time and I can track on the graph exactly when and what 24/7.Steps tracking: For some reason, Fitbit is always ~250-300 steps more than Garmin at the end of the day. Not sure why but that is not a big difference. Charge 5 has no ABC so it doesn’t track floors climbed.Sleep tracking: As mentioned above, RHR in fitbit is higher than my Garmin. It may be due to the type of sensor or other errors I’m not sure yet.SmartTrack: I have done a 10k track workout and a 1.5 hr ride with some tempo zones 2-3. On the run, fitbit sensed it and the GPS is somewhat accurate (but it’s like spaghetti lines, not precise). HR tracking was fair compared to my garmin wrist HR. Then for cycling, the fitbit sensed it but started recording late. It also inaccurately track my HR to be much lower than my garmin heart rate chest strap that I have been using for years. Fitbit says my highest HR was 142 v.s. 166 on Garmin. I know garmin wins in this one for sure. Fitbit also doesn’t allow me to look at my exercising HR graph. If I go to another tab to see my overall HR tracking, the graph does not appear accurate at all. It is simply disappointing for cycling. I didn’t even want to bother trying it in the pool.Free Fitbit app impression: I did my research on this prior purchasing. The only thing the Premium will get me is the 30 day trends, stress management, videos (which you can easily find online these days), and few other things I don’t care for. If you don’t care much for detailed graphs and numbers, free is enough for you. Premium is a rip-off.Battery: it went from 100% to about 18% by the end of the 3rd day. I only sync with my phone twice a day (AM and PM). I left always-on display off. So 7-day battery life seems to be a long-stretch.Overall: I’d give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars mainly because it does a good job tracking things but I don’t think it is there yet. I have also considered my possible bias towards it since I am comparing it with Garmin. But with my 2 years previous background with Fitbit, I do think Fitbit has improved a lot since 2017 but still need a bit more. I do think Charge 5 is great for a fitness-minded, non-competitive or non-data driven person."
760,skiwindjunkie,3,the United States ,19-May-22,"Meh, over rated.","I purchased this when my charge 2 died. I thought it would be a superb upgrade and I was very dissatisfied, so I called Amazon and returned it. I had no problems with the return when I explained what was happening and that I tried all the troubleshooting.The GOOD: Nice looking, sleek design, smooth, soft band, able to see the watch face in sunlight, waterproof. The BAD: Had to beat the crap out of the screen, tried side of the screen to come on. I tried a light touch, hard touch, it just sucked. It just took so much effort. Flicking my wrist seemed to be the only way it came on every time on cue, I saw tendonitis in my future from the constant flicking. I missed pushing a button and seeing the time. I did try the manual and auto, they both sucked. I could not imagine putting a screen protector on it, as the screen just didn’t respond for me without one. I read that people with protectors said their charger didn’t work. Not sure that’s true, but I thought I’d throw that in for you to research.  I also did not like any of the watch faces. They all looked so abstract and crazy. I just wanted big black and white lettering, and not an art showcase. I will say the screen in the light is way better to see then the Charge 2, that I loved. There is no way to arrange what order comes up on your screen like on the Charge 2. So, I must swipe through notifications, which I don’t use to finally get to my exercise.  The treadmill did not log for me, but it would in run mode on a treadmill. Amazon rep said it doesn’t log treadmill runs. Not sure its true, but there is an exercise listed for treadmill. I also didn’t see aerobics as an option, just workout. I can’t see well without my glasses, and I don’t run in my glasses. With my Charge 2, I just started my run and at the end, held the side button to feel the vibration to let me know I ended the run. The Charge 5, you must tap the screen to start, then pause, then done and then finish. What??? Three steps to end my run when I can’t see the screen. The OEM band was nice and smooth, but I could not get the right tension. I have a small wrist and on one hole I was too tight and the other too loose, so I didn’t feel it was super comfortable. I was hoping it may stretch because the band is smooth and soft. I wish someone made that soft, smooth band material for the Charge 2 but with the buckle. I like the smooth, non-buckle band but it just didn’t fit me.  Also, none of your bands, screen savers or chargers from the 2, will transition to the Charge 5. I did the 6-month free premium trial and none of the extra sleep, heart and Oxygen sensor would work. It also would not log my sleep from day one. It doesn’t count stairs anymore, but I didn’t use that much anyway, but I know people who do. In the run it buzzes you when you’re in-cardio mode and in fat burning mode, but never lets you know when your out of it. I didn’t find it useful. Plus, by the time I looked at the screen it shut off even though I had the screen display set to long time. I just felt for a brand-new tracker, it should not have had so many problems out of the gate, even trying all the troubleshooting, reading blogs from similar people who had the same problems. I looked at getting the Charge 4, most people said the Spotify was worthless. I guess if you want the 4 or the 5, it would be for the GPS and payment feature, which didn’t hit any of my needs.  I have my phone on an armband and listen to music from my phone, so the GPS worked on my Charge 2 fine. I am sure there are killer features for runners on the new Fitbit. But I just wanted a simple tracker for exercise, steps, stopwatch, and time. I just think that it wasn’t that great for what my needs were. I bought a new Charge 2 on eBay. If I could not have found a new Charge 2, I still would have returned the Charge 5 and bought another brand. There were just too many annoyances for me to deal with on something I wear 24/7."
761,Rick S,3,the United States ,21-Aug-22,"Poor out of box experience, Spo2 issues","I occasionally try Fitbit devices, even after past frustrating issues with their software ecosystem.  In this case, I was looking for a device to replace my iWatch, in particular the health metric functionality. What I was looking for is a device with good battery life, without all the constant alerts and other funk the iWatch inflicts on its users.The Charge 5 looked to fit the bill: inexpensive, provides the health data collection I wanted, had an App to present the data.  One downside is the apparent need to sign up for an expensive membership, but I figured I'd give it a year and let the Fitbit ecosystem prove its value.The trouble started almost immediately when I unboxed the device and went through the initial setup.  Total PTSD, from previous attempts to use Fitbit hardware & software.  Here, the device kept failing to perform the initial software update.  When I hit the support boards, it was clear that many others had been bitten by this, Fitbit support saying (for 6 months plus) that their team is working the issue, and the usual voodoo medicine Rx from other users about reboot iPhone, reboot Fitbit, delete Bluetooth association, Rekki massage, crystal therapy, accupuncture, and so so.  I tried various folk remedies, and after about 1.5 hours of effort got the software update on the device.  The morning after, I noticed that the device wasn't presenting Spo2.  Cripes!  So again, off to support, and the same-old, same-old non remedies.  Supposedly Spo2 won't display in some countries (go try to find out which ones), advice about getting timezone, region set properly (the devices does this automatically, so why present that as a problem resolution, Fitbit??).  Here again, after some tinkering and praying to the almighty god of tech, Spo2 shows up.  Who knows, but if we click out to 30k feet, I ask myself what Fitbit Product Owner, and Product Manager allows a flawed software stack and/or device like this one to ship in the first place.  I was this >< close to shipping the thing back to Big Jeff at Amazon, and foreswearing Fitbit for another 5 years.So he's the elevator pitch on this device:  if you're cool with spending time debugging the stuff the software team *should* have in their test cases, by all means, go for it.  The device may work eventually, just sort out the issue before the return window closes.  If you expect a more ""Apple"" experience, literally run away from the Fitbit ecosystem, or less dramatically, the Charge 5.  I should have done my more thorough diligence before I hit the purchase button, but Amazon has us so spoiled with returns, I regularly seem to shoot my toes off buying things that aren't ready for primetime (like Charge 5) and returning them.  I hope Amazon keeps track of this sort of return and brings some pressure to bear on Fitbit.Update: I did end up returning the Charge 5.  The Charge 5 wouldn't sync to my iPhone, even when the iPhone was inches away from the Charge 5 on my wrist.  I give up.  I'll stick with my Apple watch.  I hope this was just a bad device, but again looking at the support forums, I see many reports of sync issues.  I'd rather be exercising than debugging this thing.  Sorry, Fitbit, a big miss here."
762,pbretsky,3,the United States ,4-Dec-22,Inaccurate heart rate during strenuous exercise,"CON:  Fitbit’s algorithm for calculating heart rate needs work.  Perhaps their engineers did not test the watch on a range of ages and body types.  I have tried their suggestions like wearing the watch higher on the wrist, or tighter, or in a different position on the wrist (like inside), but none of these made any difference with the heart rate inaccuracy.  In short, my watch says I am exercising more strenuously than I actually am!EXAMPLE:  My Fitbit gives heart rates in the 140-160 range (near my maximum) while jogging.  I took my pulse manually and the actual rate was only around 110-120.I tested the Fitbit against two pulse oximeters (see photos).  Both pulse oximeters agreed on the heart rate, while the Fitbit was consistently far too high until the rate got closer to 100 or below it.  Then, the Fitbit often matched the pulse oximeters (or nearly so).So, if you are using your Fitbit to monitor heart rate with exercise that keeps your heart rate nearer 100 or below, it will be more accurate than an exercise that tends to keep your heart rate higher, like jogging or running.PROS:  I have liked the sleep monitor function and the health metrics, especially the heart rate variability, which is interesting to track.WISHES:  I wish more could be done via the computer rather than the cell.  Would like greater accessibility to the raw data.  Would appreciate being able to track health metrics for more than a week."
763,Dez,3,the United States ,26-Nov-22,Does the job,"I went with the fitbit not because I actually wanted it, but because I needed a new one. My old one was dying, dying, dead. I wanted an apple watch but can’t afford one. I have this program with my insurance that gives points for steps. And with those points I planned to get myself an apple giftcard. Sadly I needed a new one right away and have only half the points I would need…This works fairly well, the steps are not actually quite as accurate as I had hoped… I find that it doesn’t catch each movement properly. My old fitbit would count the elliptical as steps and it would count each movement. This thing barely catches half the steps in that exercise than my old one did.The eda and ecg scan pretty much doesn’t work at all… but I kind of expected that to happen based on the reviews… everyone else seems to have that same issue. The features available aren’t really useful to me… and the ones I want this doesn’t have. The touch screen works on and off..It works okay enough for now.. hopefully before this one dies like the old one I can get enough points to get the watch I wanted! This will do for now."
764,TAZ,3,the United States ,18-Oct-22,Low Battery Life,"I've purchased many FitBits over the years, including a Charge  2, which was replaced by a Charge 4. I bought my Charge 4 about 15 months ago. Unfortunately, the clips that attach the watchband broke. If you look it up online, it's a very common defect in the watch and FitBit won't repair it. So, even though the device works, I have no way to wear it. My Charge 2 was replaced after it developed two screen cracks. Because these watches only seem to last a year or two before falling apart, I debated whether to even buy another FitBit. However, I really like the App, so I decided to stick with it.This has been my most disappointing FitBit by far. The first day, I charged it to 100% and put it on around 7:30 pm. The battery charge is supposed to last a week. In the middle of the night, I tried to check the time, but the FitBit wouldn't turn on. In the morning, I investigated and discovered the battery had run out at 2:30 am. I did some research on FitBit's help site and there are literally dozens and dozens of people complaining about the same thing -- the battery lasts less than 12 hours and will die in the middle of the night. Lots of people had suggestions, including turning off several of the features of the Charge 5, including the SpO2, the AFib, and screen wake. I disabled all those features. These changes improved the battery life, but it effectively means you can't use the features that are supposedly the ""new features"" of the Charge 5.Thus, my advice to others is -- DO NOT buy a Charge 5. Buy the old Charge 4 or even a Charge 3, because you are getting the same functionality without battery life issues. Or don't buy a FitBit at all and look at a Garmin. Also, you MUST buy a screen protector unless you want a cracked screen. When this FitBit dies, I plan on switching to a different tracker because the FitBit doesn't last long without issues and the company doesn't stand behind their products."
765,Braverbadge3349,3,the United States ,14-Nov-22,Glitchy,"I’ve had this about 8 months and the last two months I have had nothing but problems. The first problem is the charge connection. When I connect the charger and come back apparently the connection is not sound and sometimes I will come back to the the Fitbit vibrating saying that the charger is not connected.  If I do not get it just right it will not charge.  Now lately, the screen on the Fitbit keeps freezing up.  Last week the main screen was showing on top of all the other screens.  It finally worked out, but it is still extremely frustrating as this happened right before I needed to set the exercise feature.  Lastly it has issues syncing with the app.  Almost every morning, I have to sync at least three times for it to calculate my readiness score (awesome feature by the way).  It usually says please wear device/please connect to device….even though it just downloaded the steps and sleep activity.  I’m writing this review today because today it wouldn’t even sync to my device from the app.  I had to ultimately (after shutting my phone down, turning on and off the Bluetooth) restart the Fitbit device before it would let me download.  I think the most frustrating part is that I paid $134 for this device and $70 for the premium feature, and the device is faulty and glitchy."
766,ed!,4,the United States ,28-Sep-21,A nice step up for the Charge series,"UPDATE May 2022: I'm still a big fan of this product and have made a few updates to my initial review(s), but the bottom line is that it's held up to initial impressions.  I ended up knocking off a star just because there are a few improvements that can be made, but it's still very solid.==============================I purchased the Fitbit Charge 5 as an upgrade from my Charge 3.  I skipped the Charge 4 since I didn't really need/want the new features of that model, but the allure of a color display with the same lengthy, weeklong battery life was enough to make me upgrade to the Charge 5.  I won't cover all the features of the Charge 5 since there are plenty of other places that go into great detail, and I may update this review after I get more use out of it.WHO SHOULD BUY A FITBIT CHARGE?The Fitbit Charge is great if your primary use is as a lightweight fitness tracker.  I prefer the Fitbit Charge over the Apple Watch and other smartwatches due to its lightweight nature, weeklong battery life, and my lack of need for fancier smartwatch functionality.  If you like the extra bells & whistles of a smartwatch and don't mind a heavier watch that needs to be charged every day or three, then you may want to skip the Fitbit Charge.  Also, if you're a die-hard Apple user who needs integration with the Apple Health app, then you'll also need to look elsewhere because there's no data flowing between the apps in either direction; thankfully, the Fitbit app is quite good and does integrate with a number of other apps.IS IT WORTH UPGRADING FROM THE CHARGE 3/4?It mainly depends on how much you value a better, color display.  The MSRP on a Charge 5 is $180 (though, I'm sure the sale price will drop during the holiday season), while the MSRP on a Charge 4 is $150; though, at this point, everyone's selling the Charge 4 (and 3) well below MSRP, especially if you buy refurbished.IMPRESSIONS:- Initial setup was fairly smooth.  I had to connect it to the charger to get it started up.  Transitioning from my Charge 3 to the Charge 5 in the app was easy enough.  There was a firmware update notice (the firmware enables the EDA sensor), and that update was a little buggy & required a few attempts before it succeeded (at one point, I needed to reboot my Fitbit).- ECG monitor became available via firmware update 11/9/2021.  I had some connection issues while trying to run it but got it to work eventually.  I don't have any arrhythmia issues, so while it's a nifty feature, it's ultimately useless for me.- The Daily Readiness Score also became available 11/9/2021.  It's only available for Premium subscribers. It takes 4 days before it starts functioning & a couple weeks to ""tune"".  Overall, I'd say this is not terribly useful.  If you work out on a consistent basis & get a decent amount of sleep, then it's always a great day to work out!  That is, you'll remain in the Good to Excellent range (30 & above).  For reference, I typically work out 4-5 days/week spending 30-40 min on cardio & 30-40 min on weights, which ends up being 110-160 Zone Minutes on those days when combined with whatever other Zone Minutes I rack up when not working out. But if you take a week off or so & return to working out, then you may dip below 30 into the Low score range where it says you should prioritize recovery.  I also noticed that if you forget to wear your Fitbit to bed, it can throw off your score; it sent my score plummeting for no good reason otherwise. Also, perhaps not surprisingly, the Readiness Score seems to be primarily reflective of your cardio workout.  It will classify my ""Activity"" as ""Light"" on some days when I spend a fair amount of time on weight training that doesn't really sustain an elevated heart rate (and less on cardio).- There's no longer a ""home"" button on the side of the display to ""Return"" or access additional menus.  This took a little time to adjust to, but I'm generally okay with it, especially since the touchscreen is noticeably more responsive than the Charge 3.  Now, you must swipe right to return to the prior screen, and you can also double-tap in most cases to return to the home screen; though, the double-tap can be finicky.  Would I prefer to have a ""home"" button again?  Yes.  (Now, the sides of the device used for the EDA sensor & ECG monitor).- The display is much, much better than the Charge 3/4.  Brighter with much higher resolution.  and of course, color.- The display has 3 brightness settings; however, the difference between dim, normal, and max is rather subtle; they're all pretty bright, and this is unfortunate because it's a little too bright for dark rooms in my opinion.  I liked the dim, auto, and normal settings on my Charge 3 much better.  Hopefully, this is something that will be fixed in a future firmware update (assuming, the Charge 5 still has the sensor that allows for an ""auto"" setting).- The ""up to 7 days"" battery life is not a lie.  The battery life lasts me about a week with my brightness set to ""normal"", which is the same as my old Charge 3.  I do not use the built-in GPS nor the always-on display (both of which are a significant drains on the battery), but I do average 6-8 hours/week of active exercise time.  And, since the ""dim"" brightness setting is bright enough for me, I use it all the time, which translates to even better battery life.  Pretty amazing considering the brighter, color display.- The Charge 5 does a better job of automatically turning the display on at the turn of the wrist.  My Charge 3 wouldn't always turn on or would require me to turn my wrist more than what felt natural.  The Apple Watch is still superior with regard to automatically turning on when looking since there is a slight delay with the Charge 5 after turning your wrist (and, it still doesn't always turn on).- The wrist band that's included is a nicer feeling silicone material instead of the plastic one that came with the Charge 3/4.  The ""small"" strap on the Charge 5 band is also smaller than the ""small"" on the Charge 3/4.  On the Charge 5, I use the last or next to last notch on the band (i.e. the strap is basically at its largest, most expanded size), but with the Charge 3 strap, I still had 3 or 4 empty notches to work with.  Not a big deal since they include small & large bands, but something to consider if you purchase additional bands.  I did end up purchasing the Sport band, which does have more notches to work with.  Be sure to use Fitbit's sizing tool on their website before purchasing extra wrist bands since they do vary based on which one you get.- The heart rate monitoring is nice & accurate like the Charge 3.  I run on a treadmill with a Tickr X (1st gen) chest strap, and after the first few minutes of running when my heart rate is more stable, the readings between the Charge 5 & Tickr X are either the same or only off by a bpm or two.  It's less accurate when doing sprints/HIIT since it tends to lag behind the Tickr X, but it's still in the ballpark (albeit, delayed).- The EDA sensor seems like a waste for me.  Along the lines of the guided breathing exercises in the Charge 3, it's just something that I don't care to use, and I question its accuracy/validity anyway.- I'm not sure if this was introduced with the Charge 4, but there's a daily Stress Management Score now.  The number seems fairly meaningless, since it's somewhat of a mystery as to how it's calculated.  Yes, Fitbit tells you what the general parameters are (heart rate, sleep, activity) & premium members get to see how the sub-scores feed into the overall score (see below), but in the end, it just seems pretty meaningless to me.- I think this may have changed with the Charge 4, but it no longer tracks the number of floors you've climbed (no big deal as it was wildly inaccurate), and it counts Active Zone Minutes instead of Active Minutes now.  Fitbit's website has more details on Active Minutes vs Active Zone minutes.- There's 23 clock faces to choose from.  Most of them only display one stat (e.g. HR, steps, etc.) at a time (though, you can usually cycle through them all by tapping the screen), which is unfortunate.  Hopefully, they'll add more data-rich clock faces, but overall, it's nice to see them making use of the colorful, higher resolution display.- The charging cable functions a lot better since it magnetically clips to the Fitbit (like an Apple Watch does to its charger).  I believe it's the same charging cable as the Fitbit Luxe.- My Charge 5 somewhat regularly (once every day or two) has trouble syncing with the app.  It has gotten better over time & usually just requires me to refresh the app (by dragging down at the top of the screen of the phone app).  At worst, I'll need to restart the app, and once I had to restart my Fitbit device itself.  Overall, not a big deal.  Just an occasional annoyance.FITBIT PREMIUM MEMBERSHIP:I generally dislike paying for subscriptions since the cost of them can add up to something pretty substantial over time.  The Fitbit Premium Membership isn't exactly cheap at $10/month or $80/year; though, you get 6 months for free with the purchase of your Charge 5.  If you actually use many/all of its features, then it may be worthwhile, but for me, it isn't (i.e. I won't be paying for membership when my free trial runs out in a week or so).  The Daily Readiness Score & Health Metrics Dashboard are the only premium features I routinely looked at, but I question their overall usefulness/practicality.  Here's a rundown of what you get for your money:- Daily Readiness Score: see comments above in IMPRESSIONS section - in short, not terribly useful.- Health Metrics Dashboard (see attached pic): graphs/data for Breathing Rate, Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Skin Temperature, Oxygen Saturation (SpO2), Resting Heart Rate (RHR).  The RHR data is already available for non-Premium users & you can view you most recent SpO2 reading on the device, but the rest of the stats appear to only be available to Premium members.  The graphs are actually kinda crummy; there's two types: 1) one graph allows you to vary the time scale to view 7, 30, or 90 days, but you have to visually line up the dot with the values on the y-axis to determine the actual reading for each dot, and 2) another type of graph shows 7 days at a time with individual readings on the graph, but you can't change the time frame/scale of this graph.  It would be a lot nicer if they made these graphs larger & interactive (so you could change the time scale on the fly & tap on the data points to see the reading).- Wellness Report: You can generate a PDF wellness report to be emailed.  While it provides a summary of HR, weight, activity, & sleep trends over the course of 1, 3, 6, & 12 months, it's lame that you can't just view this directly in the app.- Stress Management Score details (see attached pic): extra details on your score including the sub-scores that feed into it: Responsiveness, Exertion Balance, & Sleep Patterns.... still not sure how meaningful any of this is.- Sleep Score details (see attached pic): there's a different detailed view of your sleep score; you get sub-scores for Time Asleep, Deep and REM, and Restoration, but I believe all the graphs are the same for non-premium users, so I'm not sure that this offers much more insight that the non-premium view does; I suppose you get to see how much each sub-score accounts for the overall score.- Instructional stuff: There are various workout routines, guided meditations, food programs, & sleep programs you can look up & do.- Games & Challenges: You can participate in various fitness games/challenges, which might motivate you to work out more.Overall, I think the Charge 5 is a nice upgrade from my beloved Charge 3, and for me, it was worth paying the extra bucks."
767,clooneyfan,4,the United States ,19-Nov-22,"Overall, a good watch but it does have two serious flaws","I've been a Fitbit user for years and I really do like it. Before I got one, I was one of those sporadic exercisers who would start up and then quit a few months later. Fitbit gives me the incentive to exercise 5 or 6 days a week. I started out several years ago when I switched over from a very active patient care job to a computer job. I like the work but it's totally sedentary. I knew I needed to incorporate more walking into my daily routine if I was going to remain slender and healthy.Once I started working from home during the pandemic, I needed to ramp up my walking routine. I really don't move much during the workday. I'm 62 and my formerly slender figure was becoming doughy from being immobile behind the computer. So, I decided to get even more serious about walking regularly. I bought a treadmill to keep at home and I get on it every morning before work. I try and take a walk after dinner as well to make up for the lack movement during my workday.I upgraded to the Charge 5 a few months ago because my previous Charge 3 was getting old. It was really hard to see the screen when I was outdoors in the sunlight.  The Charge 5 has a bright, colored screen that is easier for my old eyes to see.One of my favorite features of the Charge is their notification feature-I usually have my cell phone stashed away in my purse and I don't always hear it. I like that the Fitbit alerts me when I get a call or text.  I also use it to track my sleep hours and quality. You'd think at my age I'd know enough to go to bed on time, but I get engrossed in other things. The sleep feature helps me to stay on track.The two biggest disappointments I've had with the Charge 5 are:My old charge 3 had a very strong notification buzzer (it had two settings so users could select a stronger or weaker buzz). I liked it on the stronger one. This one doesn't have that option. Oddly enough, the default on the Charge 5 started out strong like my old Fitbit so I was happy but once I updated it, the notification is now weaker buzz. Nothing I can't live with, but I wish they'd give us the choice again.The more serious flaw is this:I love that I only have to charge the battery once a week on the Chart 5 and it's easier to attach than their old clip. However, several times I've had the battery totally discharge way before it was due to be low. I had to go to their website to try and troubleshoot. Nobody really knew why so I ended up disabling a few features that I don't use often. I'm hoping that solves the issue. If it keeps happening, I'm going to end up buying a different product so I'm hoping Fitbit gets this resolved soon."
768,techfan,4,the United States ,3-Aug-22,Finally a daylight readable display!,"This is the third Fitbit I've owned. I started with a Fitbit Charge 2, then Charge 3, and now the Charge 5.PROS: The best thing about the Fitbit Charge 5 is its display. It's the first Fitbit I've owned where the display can be read in even the brightest daylight. I don't care whatsoever that it's a color display. I'm simply happy to be able to use my watch to tell time again outdoors.The next best thing about it (and all of the Fitbits) is the mobile app and website. I find these both to be well-designed and intuitive.While other reviewers seem to disagree, I've found most of the basic measurements (steps, heart rate, sleep tracking, and minutes of exercise) seem to be accurate and consistent with other devices I own.The ECG seems accurate as well. Though, here I have no other device with which to compare it.I get about 8 days of battery life. However, this is with GPS disabled (out of privacy concerns).All of the above reasons (and mostly the display) are why I've given it four stars.CONS: First, the four-star rating is based on what matters most to me. A rating that includes things that matter less would drop this device to a three-star or even two-star rating.The worst thing about this device is the lack of a physical button (or even a capacitive button) on the side of the watch. Because of this, you are limited to wrist rotation that works most of the time, swipes that often work, and taps that are often unreliable.Allegedly, the watch is supposed to return to your chosen clock face with two rapid taps. In my experience, this works infrequently. I've literally sat there tapping the watch dozens of times without it doing so.  This is far and away the most irritating thing about this watch.Notifications on this watch are hit or (mostly) miss.  About 25% of the time I get a phone call or text the watch correctly notifies me.  The other 75% of the time these notifications are lost in the ether :)The watch band that it comes with is horrible. Regrettably, the selection of replacement bands is only slightly better. I found one I can live with, but don't like. Also, the latching mechanism for the bands is far less secure than on previous versions of the Fitbit Charge. Even with the factory original band, I have some degree of difficulty getting it to latch. With at least one third-party band, it would not latch AT ALL.When I first received this watch, the ECG feature would not work. It kept requesting I (Bluetooth) pair my device with my phone (which was already done). After an annoying call with Fitbit customer service, I was informed that I needed to wait 72 hours before the ECG would work. I don't mind the 72-hour wait. I do mind that this is not documented anywhere and that the error message says nothing about waiting.The EDA scan gives me a number. The number may be accurate. It may not. Since there is no quantitative description of what numbers are good or bad, it seems somewhat useless to me.The few clock faces (24) that are available are mostly terrible. They waste the limited real estate available on the face of the watch and distract with ill-chosen, poorly matching colors.  Unlike the crisp, clean presentation of the website and mobile app, these clock faces seem designed by a three-year-old, with a short attention span, and a poor sense of color.If you've come to rely on the stair counting from previous Fitbit Charge devices, this is gone.  With the Charge 2, I previously like this feature. It gave a somewhat accurate count of stairs. With Charge 3, the number was so inaccurate, that it would sometimes register stairs as I walked across a flat room. I'm guessing rather than fix this bug, they decided to simply jettison the feature,FINAL THOUGHTS: Overall, I'm comparatively happy with this watch. I desperately wish they would bring back the button on the side (or make the ECG/EDA sensors serve double duty as a capacitive button). Failing that, I hope that a future firmware update fixes the double-tapping gesture so that it actually works. I really hope that Fitbit hires a competent graphics designer for future clock faces. The current crop of faces (with one or two exceptions) is laughably bad. That, and it might be nice if they better documented the newer features (ECG/EDA) instead of leaving their users guessing."
769,Objective Subjective,4,the United States ,16-Nov-22,"Okay, but some annoyances vs. older model","I finally bought this after the ""black November"" price break. I've been happily using a Charge 2 for multiple years, but it was down to 2 days battery and the screen had 2 cracks, which seemed to be lengthening. I was glad the Charge 5 price dropped. It's a good upgrade with more bells and whistles, but also comes with some annoyances. Others have mentioned these, so I'm not alone in having mixed feelings. So, it has a lot of new desirable functions, such as heart rate variability, ECG and SpO2. But unless you maintain the Premium Membership after the free 6 month trial, you lose them. Second, they dropped the ""Stairs"" measure. Though I didn't pay much attention to that in the last year, I did set goals for that in previous years; I don't know why they dropped it. Third, I can't find a ""clock face"" that shows my count up to hourly steps and total steps at once. That was on my Charge 2 always upon twisting  my wrist. Now, I have to tap and swipe the Charge 5 multiple times to see this. That's really annoying. Frankly, a lot of the ""clock faces"" don't make sense to me and the descriptions aren't very descriptive. I wish there was a simple way to design a display that shows Date, Time, Total daily steps and ""hourly steps plus hours goal was achieved"". That was my Charge 2 default screen.To Google/Fitbit: I just want you to know that I won't pay for Premium after the 6 month trial. I won't  use half the Premium features, so it doesn't make sense for such a high monthly and/or annual subscription."
770,KIPPER,4,the United States ,4-Nov-22,"Tracks Lots of Good Information, BUT...","The band easily holds power for 5 days on a full charge. And it has a lot of features (probably more than necessary for the average user, IMHO).My biggest complaint however, is that the FitBit App information on my Android Galaxy S10 screen runs off ""the page"", and resizing the font app to a smaller view simultaneously affects the font size of all other apps like Messages and E-Mails. Not sure if there is a workaround, but doubtful that Fitbit can make their app function independently from the Android phone settings.Also and it may just be user error, but I've trained every day (5) this week, yet the app only tracked 3 days.Additionally (and this is probably true of most fitness trackers) is that for the fitness/calorie tracking, I'm not really sure just how accurate it is. Seems to be somewhat random. Most days before my feet even hit the floor, the app shows me having walked over 200 steps.I guess I must be walking in my sleep;-)The calorie tracker is really good, though I'm not sure how many people continue using it once the chore/novelty of the feature wears off. You have to be very disciplined. Since I don't consume a lot of daily calories in general, I now only use it to track  my water intake.I'll update my review once I've used the band for a few weeks and have had a chance to work out the kinks..."
771,matt,4,the United States ,10-Nov-22,Good overall,"Ive had my fitbit a few months now. This has helped keep me accountable for my daily steps, water and calorie intake as well as remind me when to get ready to go to sleep and wake up.As far as the accuracy I'm not 100% sold on the accuracy of the ""readiness"" setting. I've noticed a few days having a high readiness rating 90 or higher but I felt exhausted/tired.I also dont quite understand the sleep graph. It shows me waking up dozens of time a night.  I'm sure theres an explanation why but I havent looked into it.Everything else seems pretty accurate.I havent paid close attention but I think the battery lasts close to a week and charges in a couple hours.Overall I'm a fan. I was an active person before my purchase and I've found the main benefit has been keeping me accountable on a day to day basis and tracking all the different data in the app is a cool bonus."
772,Amazon Customer,4,the United States ,8-Nov-22,Customer Service was very helpful,My first FitBit lasted for about 14 months.  The display quit working but the watch was working because I could see it on my dashboard.  I finally went ahead and ordered a FitBit 5.  I worked very well for about 10 1/2 months and then it just quit working.  I tried all the recommended solutions but nothing worked.  I finally contacted customer service on line.  They were extremely helpful.  I told them the date that I had purchased my FitBit through Amazon.  They were able to confirm that and gave me the choice of my FitBit 5 being replaced or 50% off on a new one.  I chose the replacement and about a week and a half later I received the replacement.  So many people conplained about customer service that I thought I should let people know about my experience with them.  I must say that I was dissapointed that the original watch didn't last longer.  For the price it should work for longer then 10 1/2 months.
773,Ruthie Wetzel,4,the United States ,3-Dec-22,Great w some small bugs,"Absolutely love my Fitbit tracker. It’s easy to wear and not too large or clunky. It does a great job of tracking my movement and my sleep. Only had two small issues. My first tracker died on me, and the replacement tracker stopped holding a charge after a brief period. Both times it was under warranty and  Fitbit replaced my device. I am on my third tracker, and so far it has been great! I prefer Fitbit to other smart watches, due to its simplicity and ease of use. 10 out of 10 would buy again, a special shout out to the Fitbit team who definitely put the customer first."
774,Jasminenirvana,4,the United States ,5-Dec-22,good but not the best,"This arrived on time, works good but sync with iPhone or Android is a pain. I have to often turn the blue tooth off and on to make the sync complete. Other than that, this is a good product. I tried three other smart watches, this came on top. Only other issue is that it does not have temperature or O2 reading on the display but it shows data on the iPhone. I whish they show it on the display. Battery is good, I charge it only once a week, which is very convenient for me."
775,Kari L. Aziamov,4,the United States ,28-Nov-22,I like the added features,I upgraded to the 5 from a 2 in order to get the added features. My one complaint is that I’ve had to restart this one from time to time. I will notice that something isn’t registering and then I realize it’s not syncing. I don’t think I ever had to restart my 2. I also liked being able to get to the settings from my app instead of on the watch itself. I’m getting used to that change though. Just a little disappointed in having to restart because sometimes I won’t notice for a little while and then I’ve lost tracking certain things. Overall I enjoy having a Fitbit!
776,Amazon Customer,5,the United States ,1-Dec-22,"Wonderful product, even better customer service","I have to be honest: I was split between Apple watch and Fit-bit Charge 5. There were pros and cons to both products:1. Apple watch is more holistic product. It's a small cell phone on its own with apps and bells and whistles to it. For example, Apple watch was critical for me because I did not have to carry my phone during running and could just download the songs. It also has call reception and message monitoring features. Fitbit is a no frill device meant to do one thing. Track your health. I already have another analogue watch and actually won't mind not receiving messages and calls while I am exercising so that was a fit-bit plus.2. Fit-bit is unobtrusive. I can wear it along with my analogue watch without looking like a douche bag (which I would if I kept a health monitor on top of a digital watch. So I like the sleek and minimalistic look of it.3. The heart rate sensor is a bit on the lower side. I had few measurements with my doctor and it seems the detector shows a bit of lesser values. But that's just my impressions.4. The footsteps are pretty accurate. Also the app shows very good monitoring of daily active minutes, mileage and other thing.Finally the best part was when my Fit-bit broke, despite being out of warranty, I got a new replacement. Excellent customer service. So I am keeping it"
777,Stephanie,5,the United States ,1-Dec-22,Best Fitbit I've EVER Had,"I adore this thing. I used my Fitbit Alta HR forever, literally 5 or 6 years. I wanted something *new* and attempted to replace it with the Luxe which fell short of expectations and was promptly returned, and then an Apple Watch SE 2nd gen which was also returned. I loved that my Alta HR tracked my heartrate and steps accurately without being big and bulky, and the battery lasted an entire week.Well I finally decided to try again and ordered the Charge 5 and it is HANDS DOWN the best fitness tracker I've ever had. I like that it tracks skin temp while sleeping and ECG and all that, but what blew me away was that I charged it to 70%ish, went to Hawaii where I wore it constantly (ocean, pool, hot days), took more than 20k steps per day, and when I got home 5 days later, it still had 20% battery left.I feel it is accurate with step counting and heartrate monitoring, battery life is unmatched, and I'll be buying one for all of my Fitbit loving family members for Christmas. Buy it!"
778,Trish,5,the United States ,26-Nov-22,"Was so impressed by my husband's, I got one for myself","Initially purchased this several months ago as a gift for my husband.  I gave it as an early mini-present since we were going to Disneyland for our anniversary weekend.  The Charge 5 worked flawlessly for someone who usually critiques everything and he commented about needing to take it off due to chafing, sweating, irritating, or interfering with his activities.I usually wear a Garmin Venu but always got annoyed trying to wear it in bed to sleep since the round watch face has a tendency to dig into the back of my hand & wearing it too loosely can make the %O2 sensor miss readings. I also usually have to take the Garmin off when I'm typing on the laptop, otherwise the loop catch + holder digs into the bottom of my wrist.  I'm typing up this review with the Charge 5 on and zero discomfort.  It basically just looks like a bracelet, but has the full functionality of telling me the time, counting steps, reporting messages, tracking motion, and all the things I want my Garmin to do.I don't notice it's on me, to be honest, which is exactly what I hope for out of a watch!"
779,TAp waTer,5,the United States ,5-Dec-22,Surprisingly great (for me),"All I wanted is to count the steps and tell me the miles and who texted me. This delivered. I wanted a super simple akin to the original Fitbit and this delivered. If you want more features order the up versions (although this version does have extra features like connect music which I don't know how it functions and I don't run or walk with music, etc). But I did not want bells and whistles that are meaningless to me. So, for me, it is 5 stars. Also, the battery lasts super long and the charger is magnetic so it fits right in (unlike Charge 4)."
780,Catherine Hughes,5,the United States ,4-Dec-22,Tracker to rule them all,"Great product for a great price. I mostly use mine for workouts and sleep tracking, both of which are quite accurate other than the step counter. Even when set to my dominant wrist setting, the step counter counts way too many steps—similar to the problem I had with my Charge 4. The buckle can be a bit awkward at first but becomes easier with practice. The smoother appearance is very nice and can be dressed up or down in my opinion. I would highly recommend the Charge 5 to anyone looking for a higher end fitness tracker that doesn’t break the bank."
781,Robyn Poley,5,the United States ,29-Nov-22,Best Buy I’ve made for myself!,"The Fitbit has changed my life. It has motivated me to lose weight, try to sleep better etc. I do not regret this decision to buy it. Today (11/29/22) I had my first issue with it, it shut down and wouldn’t come back on. It even got hot on the charger. I contacted support and they are sending me a brand new one. I’m extremely happy with this product! You will be too!"
782,Richelle Shepherd,5,the United States ,6-Dec-22,Works fantastic,"I like this Fitbit and I use it to track my activity, I don't use it to track sleep because I can't sleep with jewelry on and I love the fact that I was able to purchase the clips so I could use my bands from my other fitbit"
783,David McHugh,5,the United States ,26-Nov-22,"Charge 5: More accurate, the face is easier to read and the app so much better.","I wear my product all day to check my heart rate, how many steps I’ve taken. It also is my primary way to tell what time it is as I don’t always carry my phone while I’m working.The face on the charge five is much easier to read in the daylight, and very easy to maneuver through the different data it keeps track of."
784,Linda Ahrens,5,the United States ,5-Dec-22,Best to monitor your heart,"If you are a heart, patient and suffer from aFib , this is the perfect FitBit. It keeps track of your oxygen levels, your heart beat, has the ekg app and will send warnings when you are in aFib."
785,nicolas,5,the United States ,30-Nov-22,Very good,"All the major features of the fitbit work fine, but smaller features tend to not always work, like the feature where rotating your risk automatically shows the time. This tends to not work a good amount of the time. Sometimes screen doesn't register taps."
786,cham,1,the United States ,2-Nov-20,Terrible,"When I purchased this watch, as I was researching it, I was very excited about it. I wanted to move from myApple Watch to something that was less ""phone on my wrist"" and more ""watch with fitnesses focused capabilities. I thought that this watch was that. To some extent it is, however the fitness tracking is the ONLY part of the watch that works as advertised.Let's start with the Spotify feature that allows you to download music and play directly from the watch. Yeah, that doesn't work. It was one of the most anticipated features for me. I took the watch out of the box, connected to wifi, and went to set up my Spotify. AS SOON as I got logged in (which was a tedious process in and of itself), the watch shut off, was disconnected from wifi when it came back on, and to this day will not connect to another wifi network. I got a dud right? Wrong. This has been an issue going back for over a year for most Garmin watches that offer this ""music from the watch"" feature. For $300, if I buy a watch, there should be no issue with one of the main features with which the watch is marketed. Furthermore, if there are issues, these issues should be resolved. The only resolution to this problem in more than one year of Garmin knowing about it is an ineffective software patch.Next, we have general connectivity. This has honestly been among the things I have been most disappointed in. My phone REGULARLY disconnects from the watch, therefore rendering the fitness tracking essentially useless, as it has to sync to the Garmin Connect app to be easily viewed. I will go in to the Bluetooth setting on my phone, it says connected. I go to the setting in the watch, it says connected. I go to the Garmin connect app, it says connected. But it still isn't connected, as my data does not sync, and notifications are not received on the watch. Along with the pervasive connection issues, the general navigation throughout both the watch and the *multiple* applications that are required to access all features is confusing, annoying, and overall just more difficult that a watch of this supposed caliber should be.Now, on to battery life. The watch is advertised as having a battery life of about a week. I was particularly excited for this as well, being as I hated having to take my Apple Watch off every night and charge it. THE BATTERY LASTS NOWHERE NEAR THIS LONG. I have had the watch for a little bit over a month now, and the battery has never lasted for more than 2-3 days. It does charge relatively quickly, which is nice, but the charging port is already worn out, causing room for the charger to wiggle around and create connectivity issues, meaning that at any given time the watch may or may not be charging.I was so, so, so excited for this watch, thinking that it would be a sure-fire upgrade from that pesky ole' Apple Watch. It wasn't. If you have an Apple Watch, or any other watch for that matter, keep it. This watch has been a disappointment from the time I took it out of the box, and at every corner has continued to find new ways to disappoint. This watch isn't worth $50, much less $300. If you are looking to invest that much money in a watch, I highly recommend investing that money elsewhere. I kept this watch thinking ""Maybe its just kinks that will work themselves out."" Nope. But hey, the golf app is kinda cool if you play golf a lot. And the band is comfortable."
787,The Rockstar Princess,1,the United States ,2-Apr-22,Don’t waste your money,"Update: I wasn’t too happy with this watch when I wrote my original review. Now, I really regret wasting the money. I have read through countless forums trying to figure out how to help out my battery life. (Garmin boasts days; I get like 12 hours.) Many of the forums state that you need to disable pretty much every feature in order to get the boasted battery life. I thought the whole purpose of a smart watch was to be able to use it. If I turn off the functionality, such as activity tracking, Bluetooth, etc, then I have just a watch. Don’t waste your money on this watch. In a side note this is the 2nd Garmin I have owned, and I disliked the 1st one as well. It was the vivofit. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and try again, but Garmin is just not for me.When I first started looking, I was between Fitbit, the Apple Watch, and Garmin. After reading through countless reviews and specs of each watch, including the different types, I chose this one. I almost went with Apple; in hindsight, I wish I had. The only reasons I chose Garmin were price and the purported battery life. Well, the battery life sucks. From day one, I have had to put it on the charger at least twice a day. I don’t constantly look at it, and I am not using any extra features (music, gps) that would drain the battery. However, I am pretty active. The other “downside” of this particular model, is that the pictures show a crisp, clear, bright screen. It is not. I should have had better knowledge about the type of screen being used on this watch, so that’s on me, I guess. As for tracking, it’s alright. Any smart watch or fitness tracker, though, has its limitations. If you are carrying something, it’s not going to track your steps. Unless you are a bouncy person. If your pushing a cart or stroller it’s not going to count your steps. You have to physically swing your arms in order to have your steps count. But, every tracker is like that, no matter who makes it. Someone needs to make a tracker that’s going to recognize that you’re moving regardless of if you’re swinging your arms or not. On a side not, I used to wear my Fitbit on my ankle, but I got tired of people thinking I was on house arrest…lol. This watch, by the way, is too big to do that anyway. Overall, this watch isn’t horrible, but it’s not great either, especially for the price. I can’t wait until I at least feel that I used it enough to justify ditching it for something better."
788,Kindle Customer,1,the United States ,3-Nov-20,Totally inaccurate data,"I bought this in June. It's November and I'm finally cracking, spending another $300 to replace this with a Fitbit that will actually work. If you want a watch for seeing notifications and documenting your walks on a map, this is great. If you want a watch for the most important purpose of sleep tracking because you have chronic fatigue, THIS IS THE WORST OPTION. It only documents 1 sleep a day - no naps, no waking up in the middle of the night and couldn't fall asleep for 3 hours. You tell your watch your sleep ""schedule,"" ie. I fall asleep at 11 PM and wake up at 7 AM, and it records your sleep at that time.If I was regularly falling asleep and waking up between 11PM and 7AM, WHY THE BLOODY H$LL WOULD I F###ING NEED TO TRACK MY SLEEP!?! THOSE PEOPLE ARE SLEEPING LIKE KINGS.I have mine set for a 2PM sleep to a 12PM wake up on the prayer that it will get ALL of my sleep. Yesterday it recorded that I slept from 5PM to 7PM - cool. Then, after I slept again from 1AM to 8AM, IT DELETED THE ORIGINAL 3 HOURS OF SLEEP.This watch is NOT a sleep tracker. The data is extremely inaccurate. My Fitbit used to know when I fell asleep, almost to the minute. This why say I slept at 10PM, even though I was reading from 10PM to 11PM, even though I was talking and moving my arms to pet my dog and use my phone. It somehow manages to BOTH overestimate how much I've slept (by saying the time I got into bed and was waiting to fall asleep), AND underestimate my sleep time (by ignoring or deleting naps.) I'm guessing the type of people who fall asleep at 11PM every night don't ever toss and turn and struggle to fall asleep!?! AGAIN, THAT TYPE OF PERSON DOESN'T EVEN NEED THIS FEATURE BECAUSE THEY FALL ASLEEP ON TIME.Considering how TERRIBLY inaccurate the sleep tracking is, both the time slept and the stages, I'm going to assume that all the other data is pure crap.I wanted to love this watch. The body battery feature would have been cool, but it is based on sleep, so it's inacurate.I will say that yesterday, it picked up on my stress. I had been sitting in a chair, waiting, resting. My mind changed to thinking about an upcoming event in my life that I'm worried about, and it immediately said my stress is high. It doesn't warn me about stress often, but that was a good one.Leaving today to go get a Fitbit. I may keep this watch and occasionally check if they overcome their deficiencies, because I like how there's no paywall for data and it looks really nice... But if a paywall means that I will have data much more seemingly accurate, then so be it."
789,Kenneth F.,1,the United States ,25-Sep-21,Revised review after 4 mth use,"Revised review (1 star)  while the watch seemed to track heart rate accurately initially (and still does if I'm just walking)  I have had major issues with the heart rate tracking during mixed cardio activities.  The BPM figures seemed excessively high compared to actual, which I validated by intermittent manual heart rate checks.  I also did several mixed cardio workouts wearing the Vivoactive on one wrist and my Forerunner45s on the other, and saw differences of as much as 50BPM between the data on the two watches, with the Vivoactive measuring high.  I contacted Garmin support and after multiple submissions of data, they picked two samples (1 walking, 1 cardio) out of many and said that the results were within reason.  Never mind that there were many others that were not within reason!  I cannot use this watch to track my cardio activity, Garmin says there's nothing wrong with it, and I'm stuck.  Do not buy this product.  In fact, I don't recommend buying ANY Garmin product - their warranty and support are useless.Original review (3 star) This watch replaced my Forerunner 45s, which I liked until the sockets that held the band broke and could not be fixed.  I selected the Vivoactive 4s because it was closest in size to my previous small watch, and had all the features of the old watch plus additional features of interest.  The 4s seems to be accurate in tracking steps, distance, time, and heart rate.  Cosmetically, the watch I received has a light gold case but silver buckle on its dusty pink band, which doesn't look great but is probably not noticeable to others. The watch faces included by Garmin have sparse feature content, and I do not like the fake analog hands;  however, I was able to download a very good digital watch face free from Garmin Connect.The major drawback of this watch is the miserable performance on counting stair climbs and descents.  The results are extremely inconsistent - sometimes high, sometimes low.  I have read Garmin's suggestions on correcting this, which tell you to swing your arms while going up and down (maybe outdoors if you're on a hill, but what kind if nutcase swings their arms going up and down stairs?)  If this is Garmin's solution for excluding altitude changes such as riding in an elevator, surely there is a better method. I am resigned to accepting the lousy performance of this feature and just not tracking stair climbing, but I could have purchased a cheaper watch without the stairs climbed feature."
790,Rana Banik,1,the United States ,2-Dec-22,Support contact was super rude; language missing,"I speak English and Bangla, which is a South Asian language. Unfortunately, I found out that Garmin Vivoactive 4 does not display Bangla fonts in the preview. More than 70% of the texts and messages I receive are from Bangla speakers though I live in the US. So I went to support contact and chatted with someone named 'Sara', and I was told I needed to buy parts from that part of the world. to get the languages. On the other hand, there were 20 other mostly European language options available. I expressed my frustration by saying, ""Why do I have to buy it from the other part of the world, have we not equally paid for it?""The account gave me a reluctant 'thanks' and abruptly ended the chat.Now half of the texts I receive in the preview are full of boxes. This is really frustrating.Should've known better before buying such a less linguistically equipped device.Never again."
791,Shannon,1,the United States ,2-Dec-22,Music no syncing/terrible touch screen and buttons etc,Photo to prove I purchased and tried it out. I am an avid runner. I run about 20 miles a week or 75 a month for reference. The screen on this watch sucks you have to be very accurate with your touches which is tough when running 7 minute miles. And even when touching the perfect spot it’ll go to something different.  The bottom button has to be pressed really hard to get it to work (might just be the one I bought). Spotify music fails to sync and says there’s no wifi. We have one of the best routers and high speed wifi so this doesn’t make any sense. The watch feels like a plastic toy and too big if you have smaller wrists. The sleep tracker is off. The gps takes forever to start. Overall if you’re a runner stick with the iwatch for easier use and better accuracy.
792,Sean W. Phillips,1,the United States ,14-Feb-22,A big disappointment,"I was very excited to purchase this Garmin Vivoactive 4.  I had been using an Apple Watch for years and I was tired of having bad battery life.  I did my research and decided on the Garmin.  I knew that this was no Apple Watch and was much more dedicated to health tracking which was really what I wanted.  As I started to set up the watch I discovered that the Garmin ConnectIQ store is cumbersome at best and wildly annoying at worst.  I found a watch face that I liked, downloaded it and then two hours later got a notification that I could no longer use it unless I paid for it.  Nowhere in the store did it say that it had a cost.  Downloading watch faces or apps takes way too long.  I gave up trying to get the watch to connect to my Spotify after about 45 minutes.  My bank doesn't work with Garmin Pay so I couldn't set that up(not Garmins' fault).  None of that is that big of a deal.  Let's get to the screen.  In terms of quality, it looks like the screen of a graphing calculator I used in high school in 1996.  I knew it wasn't going to be Apple quality but its just plain bad.  All the screenshots on the website showed a nice crisp display...not the case.  The touch screen is slow with a ton of lag.  The buttons on the side need to be pressed multiple times to do what I need them to about 50% of the time.  Lastly, the battery.  No way this thing goes 8 days without a charge unless you leave it on your nightstand and don't use it.  It was down 20% after less than 24 hours...and that is with the screen dimmed and pulse ox turned off because the watch warn you that it will decrease the battery life.  I am returning it and starting to look elsewhere."
793,DanH,1,the United States ,1-Sep-22,What good is a fitness device with a totally inaccurate heart bpm and incompetent customer service?,"Extremely inaccurate heart bpm readings, approximately 90% of the time it varied by over 45 bpm discrepancy when compared to professional accurate equipment! This also leads to very inaccurate calorie calculation.Software design and options are mediocre, annoying at times and inefficient. The watch wouldn't access my Spotify account (even tough it works fine on my brand new Samsung phone). I spent hours trying to troubleshoot it, while linked trough my Bluetooth. Over the past 10 yrs, this is my 13th and last device from Garmin. A total disappointment with its gross lack of accuracy, hardware failure (within the past 48 hours it froze twice, could only correct it by letting the watch battery drain completely and then recharge it).To make matters worse, Garmin’s customer service is an even greater disappointment with its gross lack of professionalism, incompetency and no respect for Garmin patrons. I've spent over 8 hours on chat with 10 ( ten) different agents, on different days; all of them treated me as one would treat a mentally challenged person, none acknowledged the vívoactive 4 issues. To top it all, they've all tried to switch the blame on me. It seems that their training consists on convincing the customer that he/she is an idiot incapable of using a simple device."
794,JJ,1,the United States ,12-Sep-21,A Great Disappointment After So Many Years of Happiness with My ForeRunner,"I bought this Garmin Vivoactive-4, vice a Fitbit because reviews I had read said it was the more accurate of the two when it came to monitoring pulse rate.  I had read it was not as accurate when it came to sleep reporting, but that was a second level priority, it was all about pulse rate for me.  I have had my Vivoactive 4 for nine months now and regret my decision.  As expected, it does not do a very good job of tracking sleep, but what disappoints me the most is that its pulse monitoring is not even as accurate as my 20 year old Garmin Forerunner, which served me reliably and accurately for nearly two decades, regardless of the level or degree of the intensity of my activity.  My Vivoactive-4 on the other hand seems incapable of accurately monitoring my pulse rate when I am active.  Even while my upper body is barely moving and my hands fixed on the bars of my LifeFiteness upright bicycle I do not get accurate readings unless I stop peddling and then of course my exercise program re-sets and I have to start all over.  Throw in the fact that it is incapable of measuring any of that type of activity and my Vivoactive-4 realistically is limited to being little more than an attractive and reliable time piece, unless I am sitting completely motionless, then it seems to measure pulse rate accurately.  Also, as mentioned in other reviews, it shifts to an alternate data display too easily and when not intended far too often, though the Mobile App and Battery Life are Great!  .  I really expected a lot more from Garmin and will avoid the brand in the future as the Vivoactive was not an inexpensive purchase and should perform much better even at a much lower price point."
795,Boris Zuniga,1,the United States ,23-Oct-22,Not what I expected from Garmin,"I'm new to Garming watches and this is my first watch from them. Most likely the last one too. It looks nice but it won't connect to my phone.  I have a friend who has multiple Garmin watches and he couldn't figure it out how to connect to my phone. I have downloaded 3 apps and still nothing. I have the Samsung Fold 3 phone and keeps telling me that I need an app to connect the watch.Battery life is a little over 50 hours of life. The watch faces are ok but for me there is only one that I like, the rest look like they are for kids. The watch goes almost dark to save battery obviously so I'm trying to get used to it because you have to touch the screen to get it brighter. My other watches turn on automatically one you turn the wrist.I'm not sure if I'll recommend this watch."
796,californiakisses,2,the United States ,13-Feb-22,"After a year and a half...can't wait to switch, Spotify is the worst part of this watch by far","I have owned this watch for a year and a half now. I use it almost daily for my walks/runs, weight workouts, and indoor bike workouts. The main reason I chose this watch in the first place was because it was one of the smaller ones available. I am 5'9 but have small wrists, and really disliked the 'utilitarian' look of larger watches. After a year and a half, I am so tired of the issues with it and ready to jump ship. If I used this watch more regularly (I only wear it for workouts - not all day), I would have switched a LONG time ago. The amount of people who have complained about the same issues for YEARS without Garmin doing anything makes me hesitant to purchase another Garmin product, especially with the Apple Watch, Samsung, and now Google buying out Fitbit and coming up with a watch.- Spotify on this watch seriously sucks. If you check Spotify forums, you will find COUNTLESS threads of suggestions for the Spotify app on this watch that should truly be basic features at this price. Do they implement them or listen? No. Also, there is no way to contact Spotify customer service - you just get pointed towards their 'community forum' where you have people complaining of the same exact things with no fix. You can't skip forward on any track, at all. I listen to a lot of podcasts when I walk. Some are 2 hours in length while my walk is only 1 hour. This watch constantly either reverts to the very beginning of my podcast so I have to start all over (because again, you can't skip forward - so have fun listening to ads as well!) in anything, only updates 1 song out of 15 on my playlist or get the error 'sync failed', or some other random issue. Also, if you have a playlist on Spotify, you cannot choose the track you want to listen to. You have to hit the >> button to get to where you want. Really? I hope Garmin drops Spotify because they have been a truly horrible app on this watch the entire time with no effort to make updates. Take a look at the reviews of Spotify on the Garmin store if you don't believe me.- Battery life is a couple of days. However, there are points in time where my watch will be at say 80% the night before, I get ready to leave and go my walk the next morning, pick up my watch, and it's at 8%. WTF? This happens enough to be super annoying and apparently is not an 'only me' problem. It appears to be tied to when the watch updates.- I tried to wear this to track my sleep in the beginning and gave up after two nights due to the extreme disco effect of the 'gesture' motions. I tried turning on the 'do not disturb' function advertised on the watch which is supposed to disable this stupidly bright light that WILL wake you and whoever is next to you up. Didn't work. Do a search for 'Garmin watch lights up in middle of the night' and you will find all sorts of people complaining of the same thing, and not just on this version of the watch.- GPS has issues connecting and can take several minutes which is pretty annoying when you try to start tracking an activity only to see a red bar when trying to connect. I 'sync' my watch to my phone constantly so that is not the issue. I have switched between the GPS options Garmin offers on the watch to no avail. Search for this issue as well and you will see lots of people with the same complaint."
797,Matt Courter,2,the United States ,5-Dec-22,"Music function is horrible, Poor customer service.","I bought this unit for the integrated music so don't have to carry my phone around with me on runs. The music function is extremely poor. The operating system to download podcasts is clunky and very time consuming. The downloading of a 30min podcast can take 20min and half the time the download stalls and you have to start over. The bluetooth connectivity to your ear buds is unreliable. Frequently audio will cut in and out. Overall the music functionality is horrendous. I've had 3 ""troubleshooting"" calls with the Garmin support staff and all we do is restart the watch and try to update the software but I'm always up to date. There's nothing they've been able to do other than just make the process very time consuming so you just drop the inquiry. Shame on you Garmin. This is my 2nd running watch and I have an edge 500 and 530 and several other Garmin accessories. With this customer service you've lost a formerly loyal customer. If you're not going to stand by your product then neither will I.The GPS works fine. No complaints there. But I could buy a running watch for half the price if all I wanted was GPS."
798,Aaron K,2,the United States ,21-Aug-22,"Mediocre Screen, Slow, and Unintuitive","I bought a Vivoactive on Prime day as my first foray into wearables.  I don't think my expectations were overly high, but I expected the device to complement my phone (and in some cases, like going for a walk while only listening to music, replace my phone).Aside from the sleep tracking (which I thought seemed spot-on and easy to understand in the app), nothing else was worth the money.The screen was a very poor resolution. It was like a 2010 smartphone, even at arm's length I could make out every individual pixel.  The watch was also very slow; it took over an hour to download a single Spotify playlist with 100 songs. For comparison, I tried doing the same download on my phone on the same wifi network and in the same location - it took about 1 minute.The software is also unintuitive. I kept the watch for just over a week, and never figured out how to navigate the menus, start activity tracking, or open third party apps without difficulty or getting lost.  On a third-party-software note, the Spotify functionality was particularly disappointing.  Even with a premium subscription, it only supported shuffle mode...after you wait hours to download 2 playlists, you can't even scroll through them to pick which songs you want to listen to.The Garmin app that controls the watch (for Android, cannot speak to iOS) is as bad as the on-watch software.  Sporting a UI design that looks like it's out of Android Jellybean (2012?), it's as confusing to navigate as the watch menus are. I spend at least an hour trying to install third party apps and watchfaces from within the Garmin app. It kept telling me the watch needed an update, but then decided not to update the watch. It worked eventually.I want to take another moment to make sure you understand just how bad the screen resolution is. If you're used to your phone, and don't want to step back a decade, stay away.Anyway, I returned it after about a week of really hoping it'd grow on me. Nope."
799,amoney988,2,the United States ,28-Sep-22,Very disappointed,"I bought this watch on Amazon Prime Day so I could escape the clutches of the Apple Watch. After looking at all the specs of this watch, everything seemed perfect to my needs. Longer battery life, phone notifications on my wrist, activity tracking, it seemed great. But after a month of use, I can say that this watch has never once functioned as it should.The battery life is a lot less than advertised. The specs say it can go around 5 days, but I've never been able to get more than 2 out of it. In order to get 5 days of battery life, you must need to turn every single thing on the watch off so that it functions solely as a wrist fashion accessory.I was never able to get text message notifications on my watch, despite reading the manual several times, message boards on Garmin's website, and even calling customer service. I followed all of their suggestions and instructions and I could never get them to work.Additionally, this watch will just vibrate randomly on me now. The vibration serves no purpose. I twill just buzz out of nowhere. I'll check my phone, I'll check everything, and there's no rhyme or reason to why it happens, but I'd say about 2 times a day the watch will vibrate for no reason.I'm very disappointed in the watch and I would love to return it and get my money back. On a positive note, it is stylish, and I enjoy the activity tracking, but the problems I've had with it would have me suggest to stay away."
800,Phil King,2,the United States ,27-Sep-22,Sleep not accurate Oxygen scary vibration problem no HRV on watch,"As a disclaimer, i am over 70 years of age and working with technology is slow. With that said, I found the technology level poor to deal with. But the most important thing is that i have a Whoop which focuses almost exclusively on sleep tracking and recovery based on HRV, and I wore the two devices on the same arm at the same time and The Garmin got the deep sleep completely wrong with showing almost none and I had over an hour each of three days I tracked it. I had read that it had HRV in the comparison information and it didnt unless this involved buying a strap which was not mentioned anywhere. Also, the oxygen level had to be off as it said that I was 90% the first day and 92% the second and I have an oxymeter which shows me at 94 minimum whenever I take it which is often.  This literally scared me on the first day. The other thing is that if you have an apple phone, you get the step count when you are carrying your phone so that feature was useless. I sent the garmin back after six days. One added thing was I was charging it daily and the third day it fell to 23% because I guess I had too many features running. One last problem which could not be fixed from the online instructions was it vibrated between activities and then started vibrating for my text messages and I could not find nor did anyone else find how to turn these features off. This again was probably my age problem with technology but why should devices be so hard to figure out? Finally,"
801,Paige,2,the United States ,6-Nov-22,VERY simple watch,"It’s good for time, heart rate, and tracking running & steps. The garmin app itself is more useful than the watch. I get all my notifications on the watch, which is great. I can send a text, but only from a list of 5-6 options like “love you, thank you, yes, no, I’ll call you later” I can’t type a text up myself. You can download 1 music playlist into the watch to use when you don’t want to carry your phone. cool, but I end up going through the playlist 2-3 times during the workout.I don’t wear the watch to bed because I get irritation of I wear it too long, which is a me problem, not a watch problem.Customization  is very minimal, you get 5 colors for the watch face, can’t use your own photos."
802,Ana,2,the United States ,23-Aug-22,Short time life,"At first, I was very pleased with this product because it was really pretty. I found the app a little complicated since it needs two apps to handle applications; however, it was not a big deal. I got use to it quickly. The glass got scratched after 6 months even though I was being carefully. I did not notice when it actually got scratched so I cannot say by 100% sure it was broken because of a low quality of the product or because my fault (maybe I hit the watch too hard against something without noticing).  My main complaint is that it has been a little past a year I bought the watch and it is already not working. First, it started showing without any reason the screen with the option to count the cups of water and it was no way to take it out of that screen (or If I made it, it would quickly come back to show the cups of water screen). Later on, almost a month ago, it just stopped working. Sadly, this watch lasted too little. I thought Garmin had good quality products. Now I feel disappointed with this brand."
803,Amazon Customer,2,the United States ,8-Jun-22,Battery failure at just under two years.,"The functionality of this watch is great.  It tracks and trends a lot of data, and the app presents several options for reviewing your data.  I've used it for running, cycling, hiking and several other activities over the last 22 months.  Unfortunately, the battery spontaneously failed on me the other day.  It, literally, went from holding a charge for three or four days, to not being able to hold charge for a single day.It's pricey purchase to have to consider repeating every couple years.  I read several reviews about other customers having battery failures before I even bought the watch.  Some experienced it within the first few months, others within a year or two of ownership.  I had hoped that the chances of such a failure were slim, and I took a chance on the watch and the brand.A co-worker liked my watch and bought one of his own (same model).  It's battery failed within months, but luckily he was within the first year and Garmin replaced it for free.  So far the new one has lasted him about six months and is still working.I just contacted Garmin to ask what might be done since it was out of the warranty period.  They stated that the battery cannot be replaced, but offered a replacement watch for $140 with a 90 day warranty.  I know it's a deep discount, but if history is any indication, I don't think I'm willing to take another chance on this."
804,Marc J. Witcher,2,the United States ,29-Jun-22,"When it works it's good, but many features don't work well","I've never really understood the idea of having a smart watch that you have to charge after less than a day, plus I'm a runner, so this watch seemed like a good fit. The battery life is pretty good. It will last about a week if you don't wear it at night, have the pulse oximeter feature turned off, and don't use the GPS or Bluetooth. Some of the features are also pretty cool. The watch will teach you yoga if you want or give you guided breathing exercises if it thinks you're stressed - albeit having your arm in a weird position will often trigger the stress indicator inappropriately.Actually, many of the features don't work well or consistently. The GPS takes a very long time to establish a connection and sometimes will not do so. The step counter seems to stop working for long stretches of time and I can't figure out why. But the largest issue of all is the watch cannot seem to consistently connect to my earbuds - there are frequent cut outs in one or both buds.It would have been nice to think I could have gone out for a run with just my watch and a couple keys, but it seems that the features don't work consistently enough to make that a plausible reality."
805,Terry Miller,2,the United States ,16-Jan-20,Misrepresented Product Photos and Limited Sleep Tracking Functionality,"I'm not here to review the entire product.  There is much to like and there are in-depth reviews that cover all the bases. I'd just like to talk about the display and sleep tracking.Maybe I'm just spoiled by OLED, but for a $300 piece of tech, the always-on LCD is very unattractive when used indoors. The display takes in some ambient lighting to display an image on the screen without a backlight, but the image is very dark except in very bright lighting, such as sunlight (see my review photos).  The resolution is also relatively coarse, and the backlight produces an inky blue tint, even on the lowest backlight setting of 10%.  Compare the images in my review to the images Garmin advertises for this product, which in contrast appear to be heavily edited, or completely computer generated screens.  These factors combine to produce a device that looks extremely dated and cheap.Garmin addressed these problems with a device that has almost the exact same functionality as the Vivoactive 4, in their ""Venu"" product, which features a gorgeous AMOLED display.  Unfortunately, the ""Venu"" suffers from poor 2-day battery life if the display is set to always-on, and costs a bit more.Another Garmin device, the ""Instinct,"" uses an always-on monochrome LCD which looks much brighter indoors and out, without the need for a backlight except in very low lighting.  Unfortunately, the lack of a touch screen on the ""Instinct"" make it more clunky to navigate in comparison to the ""Vivoactive"" or ""Venu"" series devices.The straw that broke the camel's back for me, however, is Garmin's limited sleep tracking.  When a device is set up using the Garmin Connect app, the user must define their normal sleep time.  Whether taking naps during the day, or for people who have irregular or polyphasic sleep patterns, Garmin further frustrates the sleep tracking feature by only displaying the single longest sleep interval.  For example, if you were to sleep 4 hours, wake up in the middle of the night and perform an activity for an hour, and then go back to sleep for 5 hours, Garmin would only record the longest sleep interval detected, and then only if either sleep was performed within the time range you set when setting up the device.In contrast, my Fitbit device accurately tracks all sleep outside of any predefined range, including naps as short as 45-90 minutes.  I think Garmin has the ability to sleep outside predefined times, but chooses not to add these records for fear of creating false positives—that is, to avoid entries where the user is inactive, but not napping/sleeping.These factors combined to leave me a very bad first impression of Garmin wearable products.  The display I might could learn to live with if the other functionality was there, but I find it very difficult to keep a device which doesn't make any attempt to work alternative lifestyles, even after years of user requests."
806,DK yew,3,the United States ,24-Apr-21,"nice watch, weak battery life, music sync didnt work, too complicated/clunky interface, 4s too small","I got this as an upgrade from my Fitbit Charge 3 which I liked just fine except for the screen which I had trouble reading in bright sunlight. I also really liked the idea of not bringing my phone with me on runs, and this Garmin Vivoactive 4s had all the features needed to let me do that - music, gps, and garmin pay. And some of my runner friends had Garmin watches and they looked much sportier than the Fitbit so there was that.This is a very nice looking watch with excellent build quality.  I chose the 4s, which was a mistake for me- I didn't want a huge watch and the size of the 4s watch itself was great, but the strap was just too small for my wrist- I was able to squeeze it on but with only two holes left and was tight- so pay attention to your wrist measurement and make sure you have some extra.  But the strap material was comfortable and the watch itself felt strong and looked nice.  The display was bright and easy to read, expecially in daylight but I had no problems in darkness either - it wasn't too bright at night.  All good things. The larger display on the 4 would have come in handy in a few obscure situations but rarely. The stats on display while running were especially clear and easy to read- and useful!  This is obviously the Garmin vivoactive 4's strength.The Live Tracking feature which needs you to have your phone with you woked very well.  It let me share my location in real time with my wife while I was out jogging, and is what enables the emergency alert feature too.  It worked very well and was cool- I'm shocked this isn't a more common feature for these fitness watches.I was disappointed about the GPS lock time - it took a lot longer than the 10-20 seconds I had expected-- seemed like almost a minute even after updating my location in the app. I didn't spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to speed this up (wifi networks, etc.)  But once it locked it was pretty accurate and I was OK with it.  I did have one problem where, after an outdoor run I went indoors and climbed 10 stories of stairs - I think going inside  somehow messed up the whole tracking of the activity which was surprising. Was expecting more robustness.Garmin Pay worked reasonably well - it was a little clunky to get set up, and typing in your password on the tiny screen is silly, but you can do that while waiting in line and it can stay active for the rest of the day I think as long as you keep the watch on your wrist.  Would have been nice to be able to set a $5 or $10 limit before requiring the passcode.The on-device music sync was really unpleasant to set up and never worked right.  I don't understand why it can't be all set up from the app on your phone and pushed to the watch automatically.  Regardless, even once it was set up properly, it didn't work very well.  I have Amazon Music and I was able to synchronize one of my playlists during initial setup.  But after that nothing else worked and the playlist I set up turned out to be not great so I was desperate to get it changed.  I tried updating firmware, deleting things, etc. but nothing worked.  There is a bug somewhere and I just didn't have the patience to troubleshoot what should be a straightforward feature.  I was able to connect my apple powerbeats pro headphones without too much trouble.I never really got used to the interface - it seemed inconsistent with what would happen when you swiped in different directions- and there were screens I wanted to get to I had trouble finding but others I didn't want to see that were always there.The pulse-ox feature was neat but total battery killer.And at the end of the day the battery life was extremely disappointing.  They advertise that the battery should last 7 days in smartwatch mode, or 5 hours in gps mode with music, or 15 hours in gps mode alone.  I guess I just saw that 7 day number and figured with moderate use it would last about 7 days.  It didn't come close.  I was charging this thing at least every two or three days.  I didn't realize that one hour of running with the GPS on and music on would kill two days of ""smartwatch"" mode, or that a few hours of use in gps tracking mode w/o music would do the same thing.  So on average if you are using this the way it is intended you should really expect to have to charge it every 2-3 days minimum.  If you're doing longer gps exercises or listening to music then you'll probably change every day.  And charging isn't quick, it does charge up to 80% fairly fast but the next 20% seems to take forever.  (note that the 4 version has slightly longer battery life vs. the 4s)Sleep tracking (which you cannot do if you are charging your watch overnight) was not as good as the fitbit - it lacked the sleep stages and was just less interesting.  But it was still OK.Even though I had gotten this on sale at a great price, I returned this watch and have no regrets.  I found the music feature to be worthless, the battery life stunk even if I didn't use the music, and while the pulse-ox feature is neat it kills the already weak battery even faster.  My advice- pay up for someting much better, suck up the need to charge every day, or skip some of these poorly implemented features and get a cheaper watch that does fewer things but does them better.  Look at the Garmin forerunner 45 (forty-five) if you want GPS in your watch, plenty of options including fitbit charge 3 if you are okay bringing your phone with you (can use the phone for gps and music - saving the watch battery), the expensive Apple Watch which you will have to charge every day anyway but otherwise is a great fitness watch in addition to being a great smartwatch for everything including music, gps, and apple-pay.  On the other hand, if you don't mind throwing this on the charger every day or two and use spotify or have the patience to troubleshoot the music feature, this is a decent mid-powered over-featured sport/activity watch.  So overall three stars."
807,EJ Honda,3,the United States ,21-Nov-21,Battery life or GPS?  You can only pick one...,"**1 month update**This is my first smart watch, and while I was hoping to be blown away by all the health data I'd have at my finger tip, it's been disappointing in some regards.First, the pros:Sleep tracking - seems to be very accurate.  The Body Battery measurement seems to pull good info from this, too.  If I wake up and don't feel rested, the watch knows this and reflects this in its measurements.  When I feel well rested, it shows that.Hearth rate & SpO2 also seems to be very accurate.Fit and comfort on my small wrist seems to be very good.  Band fits me great, to the point I'm starting to think my wrist isn't as small as I thought it was.Explicit Exercise tracking - when you set it to track an activity - mostly walking for me - it works great.  The app draws a very precise map of my route and indicates the distance to a high level of accuracy.Smartphone notices mirrored on you watch - it can be really handy to be able to just glance at your watch to see if it's something that deserves reading it fully on your phone.  It's a time saver, but it's also a phone battery saver.Extended smartphone battery life - with not having to look at your phone screen as much, the watch showing you alerts keeps you from burning phone battery by activating its screen.  I went from my phone being at 30% or even needing a charge during the day, to having no less than 50-70% of battery left by bedtime. That's a huge benefit.Cons:Passive exercise tracking - either my Samsung GS21 phone wildly overestimated my daily steps in the Samsung Health app, or this watch is underestimating my steps daily.  I suspect the latter as I used to rack up about 6000 steps by mowing my lawn for 1.5hrs.  The watch only registered 1600 steps for my 1.5 hrs behind the push mower.  Looks like you really need to enable that GPS for any type of motion to be recorded accurately.Battery Life - the only way this watch is giving you 8 days of batter life is if you disable every feature on it.  For me, it's averaging about 3-4 days when I don't use any GPS function, half that when using the GPS for an hour or more.GPS impact on battery life -the documentation warns you that GPS use will greatly impact battery life, and they aren't exaggerating.  Taking a 1.5 hr walk will consume about 20-25% of the battery life.  Where the battery can last you 5-8 days w/o some functions enabled, but putting the GPS on will suck down battery pretty quick.Garmin Connect App - this app is not intuitive at all.  Some of the UI makes sense, but there are portions of it that are baffling and take me minutes of searching to find.  Supposedly this watch can store music but I can't figure out for the life of me how to load it on the watch.The watch UI - the non-intuitiveness bleeds over to the watch and its display of info.  Some of it is easy to understand, but there is some, like the Health Stats, that is too confusing to absorb in the 3 seconds the display shows it for.  The audio controls will appear for unknown reasons.  The audio controls seem to control music that's playing on your phone, which is cool, but it also gives the impression it will control music stored on the watch, but sadly that just reminds you you can't figure out how to load music onto the watch.Cost of Garmin accessories - I'd love to have a 2nd charge cable for this but they want $60 for one on the Garmin website.  Knock off cables are available here on Amazon for a third of that price, but feedback on longevity isn't encouraging.Overall, I'm reasonably happy with the watch purchase and am settling in to using it, but I'd wish it would be a lot easier to learn all the functions of the watch."
808,Joseph ,3,the United States ,13-Aug-21,"An Amazing Smartwatch—But Beware of Updates and Garmin ""Customer Service"".","Ever since I first purchased this watch, I was hooked. I use this Garmin for bike rides, walking, and as a general timekeeping device (yes, it can do that, too!). I love the hardware, the smart features, the companion app—pretty much everything about it. Until recently, I loved it so much that I became a sort of Garmin evangelist, convincing my girlfriend, my parents, and friends to get Garmin watches of their own. (Amazon was also the right place to buy this—no qualms there.)Now, I don't need to go through all the features of this device. If you want a good-looking, accurate, and reliable smartwatch for daily use and physical fitness, then this is likely the best for the price.Did I say reliable? Well... maybe not exactly.From the first quarter of 2021 through most of July, my device performed admirably. Sure, sometimes the GPS can take a while to connect, but overall, the watch did everything it was supposed to. It consistently did a good job.Then, I joined a little cycling event called the Mount Evans Hill Climb, which took place July 24, 2021. About 28 miles of high-elevation riding, one-way. More importantly, this was my first cycling event ever. Of course, I had my trusty vivoactive 4, ready to rock 'n roll.Soon, we were at the starting line. Hundreds of riders eager to ascend. The starter stood by with the clock.""And... GO!""We started riding. Cyclists all over the road, spandex as far as the eye can see. On the move, I started the ""Bike"" activity on my watch.A few miles of high-altitude went by and I checked my Garmin. Something was wrong—the screen FROZE.WHAT?! In over half a year of regularly using this device, this never happened!I fumbled with the watch, trying to turn it off, restart, anything—while riding up a mountain. But the watch just would not respond.I had to focus on the ride, so I stopped trying to make it work. A few miles later, I looked down and the screen was off. It wouldn't turn back on, even though its battery was over 50%.So, I had to ride over 50 miles with a dead watch on my wrist.But, as emphasized before, this malfunction was a first. The cause? Perhaps an update Garmin sent to the watch in the days before the bike race.I contacted Garmin customer service and told them what happened. No offer of support. One customer service agent found me annoying. After all, why would I care that the GPS watch I use daily failed during a cycling event? I must have some audacity to be upset about this.I did, however, get a dismissive, ""Sorry this happened on your bike ride.""Again... WHAT?! A ""bike ride""? You've got to be effing kidding me, right? This is a world-renowned cycling event—and the first one I did, no less.To this day, I only received trite apologies and empty, sometimes passive-aggressive communications from Garmin. This, after all the praise I gave them, after all the business I gave them!Downright disappointing.On a brighter note, the watch has performed like usual since this crash. That said, I'm less optimistic—and more jaded. My vivoactive failed on race day, and the ""customer service"" I received might as well have come from disinterested, teenage McDonald's employees. Perhaps I was foolish for putting such high hope in a piece of tech.Alas, if you're considering the vivoactive 4—or any other Garmin watch, for that matter—be cautious with updates. A software update, despite its promises, might make your device crash when you rely on it most.But hey, if a malfunction happens, at least Garmin Customer Service will be there for you."
809,D,3,the United States ,8-Feb-22,Solid GPS & customizable. Inaccurate vital stats and generally underwhelming.,"I bought this watch looking for a device that would pair nicely with a smartphone, have good health data options (steps, pulse, o2, etc...), and wouldn't break my budget.  I also wanted to try moving away from Apple products.  The Garmin Vivoactive 4 seemed to fit the bill.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype.There are quite a few positives to the device.  It is comfortable to wear, easy to learn the buttons, and quite customizable.  I really wanted to be able to view health data at a glance without needing to browse through menus to see specific numbers, and I was able to find and download a watch face that showed me exactly what I wanted to see:  time, date, daily step count, outside temp, heart rate, oxygen level - all in a clean presentation.  This required downloading a 2nd app (ConnectIQ) on my smartphone, but the extra complexity was worthwhile.  The Vivoactive 4 has adequate storage for a sizable playlist of music, and could pair directly to my bluetooth headphones.  I was mildly concerned that my desire for frequent pulse-ox scanning would drain the battery quickly, but it still gave me 2+ days of moderate activity.  I never had a day that burned through the entire battery, even when I included some longer outdoor GPS tracked activities.Unfortunately, even though I had my health stats easily viewable, the value of that turned out to be minimal due to it being completely inaccurate.  My oxygen level on the watch would generally move between 90-95%, whereas with an actual pulse-ox I would get readings of 97% and up.  During a bike ride, I checked my heart rate and the watch consistently reported it in the 50s & 60s, while manual checks put it between 90-120.  Outdoor temp would often not display anything.  Comparing this to the lower priced Apple Watch Series 3 that I previously had, the graphics/brightness were lackluster on the Vivoactive & touch controls were less accurate.  It's also worth nothing that the Vivoactive could not control music, videos, or audiobooks playing through the iPhone.  Having to reach for the phone every time I want to rewind a few seconds or adjust volume is inconvenient after years of being able to do those things with a tap of the watch.  Interacting with alerts, calendar, and phone apps is minimal on the Vivoactive compared to Apple watch.+ Customization+ Battery+ Onboard music storage- Accuracy of health data- Graphics/Controls- Interaction with iPhoneOverall, I'd give this up in a heartbeat to go back to an Apple Watch.  I was really hoping the extra cash I spent on the Vivoactive 4 instead of a new Apple Watch Series 3 would have given me reliable access to pulse-ox.  Unfortunately, overall I ended up getting far less value comparatively overall."
810,robert downs,3,the United States ,14-Jul-22,"THE SCREEN IS NOT, I REPEAT, NOT BLACK!!!","Hello All,Please be advised that the screen on this watch is NOT black. The screen is a bluish grey, NOT black, more like a cheap black and white TV. The watch looks nothing like the photos here on Amazon or on the box. Colors are NOT true, but faded. Be warned.THEY SAY (after you complain)That the screen is set for active outdoor use, that it's an active SPORTS watch easier to read in full sun light. They also say it saves on battery life. I believe this.I JUST WISH THEY WOULD HAVE SAID IT BEFORE I BOUGHT IT....UPDATE: 7/15/2022SO I TOOK THE WATCH FOR A SWIM WORKOUT.I get what Garmin has done, the screen looked excellent in and out of the water, the screen is very sharp in the bright sunlight. THIS WATCH IS CRISP and I actually prefer this screen to a black screen for workouts.Images 1,2 at the pool. Image 3 inside.TAKEAWAY:PRO: I like the data I am collecting and the app. PRO: It is extremely comfortable and well built. PRO: It is NOT an iWatch. PRO: It is a good value at $200. PRO: it is mainly an introductory workout watch and that is all I need.CON: The advertising photos are an absolute lie so if you are buying this watch for ""STYLE"" I would move on.  CON: The colors are not true at all and the downloadable watch faces look nothing like they do at the store on this watch.LAST WORD: I need a good workout watch that is more rugged than the iWatch at the $200 -$250 level. I dropped my Series 5 iWatch in Hawaii and it shattered the glass back. The watch was 2.5 years old and cost $350, that's over $100 a year for a watch. There are not a lot of bells and whistles for your iPhone, but I am trying to get less connected and more into my workouts and health, so it's a keeper... for now."

 This complex, app packed, Garmin Vivoactive4 has all the features but what good are they when the watch needs to be charged nearly daily?  Bought 2 Vivoactive4 Garmins to replace our few year old Vivoactive2s.  The 4s are a waste of hundreds of dollars for a watch that has taken my view of Garmin to a new low.  Feature packed and battery life lacked.  Don’t buy it.  I bought it because of the two to four week plus charge life of my previous Garmin.  This 4 is full of highly functional tracking and monitoring applications but fails when it comes to everyday use.  Give me a watch that lasts a month on a charge!  Days are not enough.

813,Arynn M. Curtis,3,the United States ,16-Aug-22,"Wanted to love it, but sent it back.","I had a basic Garmin vivofit that I wore until it died.  I can't stand apple and didn't want to go with Samsung due to battery life.  I was excited to try this Garmin as it seemed like a great product.  I wanted to love it but just couldn't.  First of all, the apps/uses are not that user friendly.  They should just be in the app (Garmin Connect), but nope you need another app to get different watch faces.  I downloaded that and found a face a liked that had a cost.  Nope, I am not paying for one so I went back and found a different one that was free.  Then I found out you have to download a program onto a computer, connect the phone to a computer, and update it through that program.  Who even uses an actual computer anymore?  In today's age, this should all be able to be handled via a phone.  So, after a frustrating couple of hours I just gave up and sent back the watch.  I gave in and ordered the Samsung Galaxy.  It is user friendly and was working with custom face in literally 10 minutes.  I may have to charge it everyday but it is much easier to work with."
814,Amazon Customer,3,the United States ,6-Dec-22,Does not detect stress level. Keeps telling me to stay super still and try again. I have not moved,Does not detect stress level. Keeps telling me to stay super still and try again. I have not moved. Does anyone else have this problem?
815,Amazon Customer,3,the United States ,13-Feb-20,Underwhelmed,"I did a lot of research before buying a sports watch. I'm a runner, 6 days a week, all year long. I wanted a serious runner's watch, not a gimmicky sports watch. I was looking for something as well to help me with accurate calorie counting. Sleep monitoring was not a must, but I thought it might be interesting. This was one of the more expensive watches I looked at. And, I'm disappointed. First, this was advertised as a smaller watch for women--wow it's still pretty big (see photo). It came with very few instructions. I had to figure it out by messing around and looking online for tips. The Garmin Connect App is ok, I don't use it all that much. The running tracking seems super inaccurate which is the most disappointing part. I can run the same 4 mile course one day as a recovery run, and another day as a speed workout, and despite the fact that this is supposed to monitor HR and I would think modify calorie expenditure accordingly, NOPE. It will tell me I burned the EXACT same amount of calories. Sometimes the faster run will say I burned FEWER calories because I ran for less time. WHAT?? One day I ran with my phone and my watch--with my Strava app tracking on my phone--and Strava said I burned 100 more calories than the watch said. I also thought the watch might track my activity during the day and modify calories burned for that as well, but you don't get any calorie tracking unless you specifically put in that you're doing a workout and what kind. The sleep monitoring I don't think is dependable, although I went online and read an article recently about sleep tracking and I guess most of it is not that accurate. So, really that's not all that helpful. And, the watch is kind of gimmicky still! When I run 4+ miles a day I really don't care how many ""steps a day"" I do but the watch gives you little notifications! And, if you've been ""sitting"" too long it tells you to ""Get up and move!"" which is ridiculous unless you really need that. I guess I can probably figure out how to turn that off but honestly haven't wanted to put in the effort to figure it out. The one thing I really really like about this watch--I can run Spotify to my bluetooth headphones. That is SO nice. I feel so light not carrying a phone or Ipod to play my tunes. Although, be aware that the watch is really glitchy when it comes to pairing headphones. I have a tried and true (several years old) pair of Jaybirds that I love and they absolutely will not pair to the watch. I have newer in-ear buds that I didn't buy for running but were the only ones I could pair. The key: turn OFF the bluetooth on your phone before you even turn the earbuds on. Even then sometimes it's glitchy. So: overall, PRICEY phone for mediocre results. Next time I would go with something cheaper, if it's just going to track distance and give me a calorie output based on GPS. One more tip: If you want to change the look of your watch face (and you want to!!) you have to download Garmin ""Connect IQ"", there are a lot of free watch faces you can download."
816,Natalie,4,the United States ,19-Jan-21,My favorite watch ever,"Update:I have now also tested this against the Fitbit Versa 4, and the Garmin wins by a landslide. While the Versa does have much better sleep tracking and I like that you can count distance instead of steps, the UI is terrible and the touch-screen isn’t very responsive. Also, only a very short list of iPhone apps integrate, so I couldn’t get WhatsApp and a few other frequently used apps’ notifications to the Versa. On top of all that, it was unnecessarily bulky.My main beef with Garmin remains the sleep tracking. I also wish you could track distance vs steps and that you could still see the time of day when you’re tracking a workout. I still absolutely love the UI surrounding the timers. I use them multipe times a day while cooking or doing chores, and it’s so simple to just swipe and type in a number. I also love how you can make the timer repeat so easily if you’re doing intervals (although I do wish you could set alternating intervals). It’s truly amazing how something so simple can affect your life. I don’t think I’ll ever switch to another watch.Original review:I’ve had four fitness trackers in my life: a Fitbit Flex 2, an Apple Watch, and a Fitbit Charge 4. My main needs are step counting, sleep tracking, timers, and phone alerts. Here is what I’ll say about the Vivoactive 4s.Step counting is pretty accurate, but I don’t know of any watches that do this poorly. I do wish that you could add steps manually. I have a treadmill desk, and the watch won’t count those steps or track the treadmill workout - I think the watch can’t register my motions because my wrists aren’t moving. Not a big deal because my treadmill counts steps, but I wish I could merge them with my Garmin data. That’s my only beef with the app interface and movement tracking.The GPS works great, and it’s fun to see your little map on the watch face itself. My husband also has a Garmin, but it doesn’t have that feature. One weird thing about the GPS is that there is a screen within the GPS interface that has a whole mess of little icons. I assume those are meant to be plotted on a map, but I can’t figure out how or where to do this. The manual doesn’t address it.I will say the sleep tracking leaves something to be desired, and the quality is poor enough to knock a full star off the overall rating. It’s a huge step down from Fitbit, which is by far the best at sleep tracking - it will even track naps. The Vivoactive’s tracking is wildly inaccurate. It rarely records my sleep times correctly and sometimes thinks I’m asleep when I’m just watching tv or reading at night. This is the only way in which the watch lets me down, and it is a significant disappointment. It’s not as bad as the Apple watch, though. At least you don’t have to remember to turn on a completely separate app when you go to sleep.The O2 sensor isn’t important to me, but it does drain your battery in a big way. I don’t think it’s very accurate, either, so I turned it off.I do like the interface. It’s way more customizable than the Fitbit and Apple watches, and you can rearrange your menus and also hide things you don’t care about. You can also turn off the light entirely. I have my right-swipe shortcut set to the facelight dimmer, so I turn it all the way down at bedtime. I really like the Find My Phone button, although if you press it accidentally while you’re holding your phone, you get a bit of a jolt!I think you can do voice calling with this watch, but I don’t have an Android. The call/text/other notifications work fine with my iPhone.One of my main beefs with the Charge 4 was that it vibrated. Like constantly vibrated anytime you scrolled through a menu or touched it at all, and you couldn’t turn it off entirely. The Vivoactive has customizable vibration intensity, and it only vibrates for notifications and confirmations.The timer on this watch is by far my favorite. I cook often, and having a timer on my wrist is super convenient. I love that you type in the time instead of scrolling. Such a simple feature, but it’s completely painless.All in all, I would 100% recommend this watch. If you don’t take into account sleep tracking, I give it five stars."
817,Amazon Customer,4,the United States ,27-Oct-22,Great watch for the Price,"Watch works great.  Garmin is a great product. It looks nice too. Not overly large on small wrists.  Tracks a lot of vitals pretty accurately and reminds me to move when sitting.  Drawbacks: If paused for more than 20 minutes during an activity, it assumes you are done & ends the activity.  A problem when hiking & stopping to take in scenery or have a snack! No preset ""hiking or backpacking"" option which would track calorie burn more accurately than a walk. The 8 day battery life is more like 3-4 days if you are tracking activities regularly.  Still better than other wearables but nowhere near 8 days!"
818,Craig,4,the United States ,13-Aug-22,UPDATE - Great! Until the touchscreen stopped working.,"**UPDATE - So Garmin customer service really came through for me. I contacted them via their website, answered some questions, and was informed that since this touchscreen issue was a manufacturing error they were aware of, my 4S would be replaced free of charge. They would send me a replacement and I would send them my watch. The new watch arrived and worked perfectly! I opted for the faster exchange, putting up a deposit that was refunded when they received my old watch. Super happy about all this!**I really love the Garmin 4S. I switched to this after having a Fitbit Surge for years. The Garmin has a lot of great features, awesome battery life, and the display is so easy to read in any light. There are honestly more features than I use, and it worked great for all the activities I engaged in. Until the touchscreen totally stopped working, which makes it impossible to select activities, turn on timers, change settings, view stats, etc. The only way I can do this now is on my phone via Garmin Connect. It's been 26 months since I bought it, which doesn't seem like long enough for a quality fitness watch to fail like this. I have not abused it, it hasn't been immersed in water, damaged by chemicals or used in any way other than it was designed to. I'll probably end up getting a new one via Garmin exchange. I'm waiting on a response from them. The exchange (it's out of warranty now) will be about half the price of a new one. The Garmin Connect app is wonderful, easy to edit activities as needed, easy to get in depth information, track health stats, etc. You can also personalize the display, watch face, and other features on the 4S watch."
819,Wayne,4,the United States ,26-Oct-22,Garmin is a good watch,"I purchased this Vivoactive 4 as a replacment for my Garmin Vivoactive 3, which I have had for years.  So far I am very pleased with this new watch.Only downside is the charging connection.  I purchased an aftermarket charger because the charging cables Garmin provided didnt last long at all.  However, even the aftermarket charge which does a better job of staying connected to the watch seem to fair over a short period of time.  This was also an issue I had with my old Garmin Vivoactive 3.If it doesn't improve this might be the last Garmin watch Purchase"
820,Mixedbag,4,the United States ,12-Nov-22,Works well for limited heart monitoring & as a watch,It does the basics well. The golf functions are VERY limited. The charge could be much longer. You have to learn to cut corners on the settings to get it to last 4-5 days. It is durable - which I need! The first two competitor smart watches I bought for much cheaper (without golf functions) lasted less than one month for me. It is OK - but I expected more for the price.
821,Amy Chitwood,4,the United States ,8-Nov-22,"Overall I loved this watch, just liked the size of the 4 screen better","The face of this watch was small for my preference on a touch screen.  After wearing the vivoactive 4 for a few months before trying this, the 4s was way to small for my preference.  I'd love it if they made this color combo is the same size of the 4."
822,Ty Jones,4,the United States ,28-Oct-22,Great for work use,"Can customize watch face, drains battery quicker though. Great for work wear and tear. Garmin GPS allows to start runs literally anywhere. Definitely a good value option for those who love to exercise, especially run. Been a fan of Garmin since I was a teenager. From the 4:12 mile I ran in hs to the casual 10 miles I run as an adult now Garmin always holds out 👌"
823,Cy3456,4,the United States ,23-Jan-22,Overall I'm very happy even though I have several complaints,"I'm happy with my purchase but that wont stop me from listing all the negatives.  It's my second smartwatch/fitness watch and it has brought a lot of insight to my fitness, health and sleep patterns.  I realize this watch is not perfect for everyone's needs but for what I paid the value is suitable.  It is more of a fitness watch and less of a smart watch in my opinion.  It works great tracking the workouts I do such as hiking, swimming and strength training.  The Garmin Connect app provides a lot of relevant information in a easy to view summary.The battery life is pretty decent compared to other smart watches in the same price range.  It doesn't have the fancy AMOLED display which I assume is what gives it better battery life.  The display works well, easy to see and touch sensitivity is just fine.  Rapid chargers don't seem to speed up the charging but that's no problem as it still charges relatively quickly.  I think it can fully charge in about 2 hours.  I usually go 3-5 days between charges.If you have data roaming turned off on your smartphone and you go outside your carrier's coverage area this watch will notify you every 10 minutes with a vibrate and a message telling you to turn on data roaming.  It happens when driving and it's so unnecessary.  There is no way to turn this off.  Fortunately my cell carrier doesn't support data roaming so I turned data roaming on, I don't get charged any fees and now the watch notifications have stopped.  Very annoying Garmin, please fix.The watch faces provided are lacking.  Fortunately the Garmin Connect IQ app has several free options other people have created.  I found one that works for me.Garmin Pay does not support my credit card bank.  So if you want to use the wireless pay feature this watch has first verify on Garmin's web site if your bank is supported.The original silicone watch band works alright however it does not allow water between the skin and band to dry.  I found my skin would often get irritated after being wet for too long.  Had to buy a different band to fix the problem.I disabled all notifications except for the Connect app.  For me personally I would rather use my smartphone for all notifications since it's much easier to read and respond to.  The watch is just there to log fitness data, tell time/date and heart rate.If I paid Garmin's full retail price I would have been disappointed however this watch has been selling for much less in the past few months and what I payed does match the value I'm getting.  Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase."
824,CJ Ride,4,the United States ,20-May-22,Perfect for my mtb rides,"I purchased this around a year ago hoping it would allow me to record my mountain bike rides. I've never been into carrying a phone on my rides but I've always wanted to track time and distance rather than to guesstimate on those things. Not many mid-price devices work for cycling but this little guy does. I'm not super into fitness tracking so I can't speak to how well this does with that side of things, but with the accompanying Garmin Express app, I get detailed gps maps of my rides with details regarding time, distance, elevation, heart rate, speed, and other features if you want to use them. I don't use the lap feature but it's in there if you want it. So happy to be able to see my rides in detail. The other day it triggered the alert feature when I did a steep drop then slowing down quickly as the drop rose back up. It thought I had fallen until I started back up. I didn't know it went off until the ride was over and I saw that it the alert didn't send. Nice to know someone would have gotten an alert if I had fallen! The only issues I've had with this device have been setting up the compass. I finally got it to set after 100+ tries carefully following the instructions. Even my kids couldn't get it to set so that's saying something. The other issue is how long it takes to connect to gps. Once it's connected it's good to go but push the gps start a good 5 minutes at least before you start your ride : )  Oh yea, I used it on a couple of ski trips this winter and it was fun to see that data, too! It's suited to recording all kinds of activities. I'm a garmin fan now."
825,Robert Cooprider,4,the United States ,20-Oct-22,Great watch,I really love the watch. The only negative is the battery life is literally 2 days. If I have all the features turned on the battery life is 1 days. I do feel the product info was misleading about battery life.
826,Ashley S. Bluth,5,the United States ,5-Nov-20,Going from Fitbit to Garmin (or Polar?),"I have been a Fitbit user for a few years and it just suddenly died on me so I was in the market for a new fitness watch. I like to take gym fitness classes, I teach yoga, and also do martial arts. After looking at 7 different watches I narrowed it down to the Polar Ignite and the Garmin Vivoactive 4s. I bought both and this is my own review.Polar has a $190 price tag, 4-5 day battery life, GPS, VERY accurate heart rate monitoring (that’s what they are known for), in my experience the sleep monitoring was more accurate than the Garmin, but not as user friendly as the Fitbit. The polar has a very bright and clear screen, but like the Fitbit you have to flip the wrist to see it light up. In contrast, the screen is actually harder to see than the Garmin when out in the sun, (say on a run). Polar will give you suggestions for recovery that go with what you did to workout and I thought that was neat. It also has a nightly recharge score (like Garmin’s “body battery”). Cons: it is slow to wake, like the Fitbit. It would occasionally disconnect from my phone, it does not have music downloadable to the watch so you have to have your phone nearby, and the texts that come through are too big so you only see a portion of it. It also does not have menstrual tracking which I found handy on the Fitbit.I ended up returning the Polar and keeping the Garmin vivoactive 4s and here’s why. Garmin may have a higher price tag ($230), and a duller screen. See picture. But many good qualities that after a few weeks of trial made me choose it. It says the battery life is 7 days, but I got 4-5 days. Has GPS (on par with Polar). Has music you can download to the watch so you don’t have to take your phone with you! I did not have any music when using the Fitbit so I didn’t know this was something I would like so much, but it’s awesome. The watch face is 40mm as compared to the Polar’s 43mm. I like a smaller watch. The heart rate was pretty much the same as polar, or within 5bpm. If you look at the picture I have of a run I did you can see how Fitbit did NOT accurately detect when I went from walking to running and the other 2 watches did. Another plus is that the screen is always on. Also not something I had with Fitbit so I didn’t know what I was missing. When doing an activity and you want to quickly know what your heart rate is, Garmin is hands down the best option. The screen will light up more if you touch it, but you can always see the time and anything else you want on your display (I have time, heart rate, date, weather, messages, battery, and steps all on my watch face). Garmin will track your sleep, but it isn’t as detailed or accurate as the Fitbit or polar, but it does have something cool called Pulse Ox that measures your blood oxygen levels (like those clips with a red light they put on your finger at the doctor’s office). This is good to detect any problems you may have while sleeping or even during the day. Garmin does have menstrual tracking and also Garmin Pay. A con would be that Garmin does not add naps into your sleep for the day. It will only track one sleep for the day, not multiple. The display is by far the best over the 3 watches when outside. It’s almost like a kindle screen when you are in the sun. You can change settings so when you are  in a workout you won’t get any messages or notifications so they won’t interrupt you (I am someone that will immediately look at my watch when it buzzes so I turned those off when in the middle of a workout).Now if you have been a Fitbit user like I had and switched to one of these watches, the apps are very confusing. Fitbit has by far the most user friendly app. But with a little time, either app will become familiar to you as well.I am not a runner, never have been, but I have turned into a runner because of the Garmin watch. It has a coach setting where you can plug in a goal and it will coach you to get to that goal. I am very competitive so I make sure I am going to get to that goal (a 5k run). It is very satisfying to see your runs displayed on the app and to rate them on how you felt that day.In conclusion, depending on what you are looking for you might choose a different watch than me, but I love my Garmin Vivoactive 4s now."
827,Brandon Bigam,5,the United States ,14-Oct-21,This is the best fitness/smartwatch (for me),"I've tried several smartwatches and finally found the one for me with the Vivoactive 4!I started with Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 - terribly short battery life and very slow charging. Tried Amazfit GTR 2 - nice but couldn't get past being tethered to China, and poor app. Fossil Hybrid HR - beautiful to look at, buggy and inaccurate. With Garmin I tried the Venu 2: beautiful screen and great features, but annoyingly buggy, and with erratic battery life. Vivomove Style - worked fine but small and just not enough good features.This is the one. Sometimes I'll compare/contrast Vivoactive 4 (VA4) with Venu 2 (V2).Pros:-Just about the right shape and size and weight for me. Looks nice; I originally wanted the black but the shadow gray/silver bezel was $50 cheaper. I like the silver bezel, looks classy, and I'm happy with it.-Interface smooth and easy to use. Different from the Android-like style of Samsung or Amazfit but easy enough in its own way. No lags. Decently customizable. Decent app selection in the store.-Touchscreen works really well; responsive when I actually want to use it, but rarely picks up accidental touches, or wiping it with my sleeve. (V2 was terrible for accidental touches and always activated when trying to wipe it off.)-Great fitness features for general casual fitness (probably not for pro athletes). Good GPS for hiking (under the Walking activity). Lots of good motivators to be active, and tons of metrics even just for normal daily use.-Excellent battery life, good for a week without GPS activities. GPS uses ~10% per hour, still good. Charges in a little over an hour. (V2 charged even more quickly, but battery life was erratic, and far shorter with always-on display.)-Good selection of watchfaces, stock and third-party.-Transreflective display - I wasn't sure about this, but I've come to really like it! It's certainly not as ""pretty"" as AMOLED like on a Samsung or the V2, but much more practical, and far better battery life. AOD 24/7 for a week straight, backlight only needed in the dark, very clear and easy to read in sunlight - a much better choice for a fitness-focused watch in my opinion. Very happy with it! (The AMOLED AOD on the V2 was my main problem with it, other than general bugginess. It sapped the battery like crazy. It also couldn't be turned off quickly on the fly, like for a movie or a nap. Not a problem on the VA4!)-I like Garmin Connect. Pretty easy to use and lots of info.Cons:-Transreflective display - I like it, as noted above, but it takes some getting used to at first after AMOLED, and will never be as ""pretty"" except in bright sunlight which is where it really shines (literally).-Slightly thicker than I might prefer.-Plastic build, other than bezel. I don't mind and it's sturdy and light, but it doesn't say ""premium.""-Occasional problems getting a GPS lock after traveling to a new location. It helps to sync and then restart the watch.-Connect IQ, the app store, is poorly organized and has a lot of junk in with some gems. Looks like the Android Market 10 years ago.-Sleep tracking. For me this is the major con, especially compared to the V2. Accuracy is only okay, sleep and wake times decent, but sometimes missed when I'm in bed awake, or even got up to go to the bathroom. No sleep score and no insights, and can't view sleep on the watch. Sleep tracking is where the V2 really excels by comparison - impressively accurate, and very helpful sleep score and insights, onboard calculation and widget... the V2 outstrips the VA4 by miles here. I really, really wish Garmin would bring the updated sleep tracking to the VA4 as a firmware update. Or a VA5. I'd buy it!Aside from the lackluster sleep tracking, I'm extremely happy with the Garmin Vivoactive 4. It's (almost) everything I want from a fitness/smartwatch. If Garmin brought the better sleep tracking to it, I'd say 5 stars, solid. As it is, call it a strong 4.5, and the best available for my needs."
828,Fernando Salom,5,the United States ,6-Dec-22,"Buen reloj, mide satisfactoriamente la actividad física","Es un buen reloj que sirve para hacer seguimiento de manera efectiva a nuestra actividad física diaria. En cuanto a lo que no me gusta está la resolución de la pantalla, que es inferior a la de otros relojes que he tenido. La duración de la batería está por los dos días, lo que parece bajo"
829,Jordan,5,the United States ,1-Dec-19,Fitness first - Smartwatch second,"Those of you more interested in fitness first, smartwatch features second, will really enjoy this watch. My Vivoactive HR just died after having it for over 3 years, so I upgraded to the Vivoactive 4. This is a major upgrade in terms of looks and features. Here are all the things I love:1) Two buttons - I originally bought the Vivoactive 3 Music because it was on sale for $200, but I quickly realized that missing the second button was a major pain point for me. Having the two buttons is so much more convenient for overall navigation. Also when you're in a workout, the second button can be used for setting a lap (instead of the vivoactive 3 where you have to double tap the screen). The second button alone was worth the extra spend. The vivo3 had a 20mm band, where the vivo4 is 22mm. The bigger band makes it look a lot better. The extra 0.1in screen space is well utilized also. It does make a difference.2) Touch screen - I also tested out the Fenix 5 Plus for a while; now that is a great watch. The only issue I had with the Fenix was that you had to navigate all with buttons. The buttons are great for fitness and water sports, but when you're in the office, it's a little awkward when you're sitting in a meeting pressing buttons to navigate through texts or emails. Fenix was an amazing fitness watch, don't get me wrong, but it didn't work for my professional life expectations. Because it felt weird to have to press 5 buttons on the Fenix at the office, I wanted to go back to the touchscreen. Touchscreen is so much quicker and easier than the buttoned Garmins. It also looks cooler, and makes it truly feel more like a smartwatch.3) Fitness features - If you're never had a Garmin before, they are amazing tools to help your fitness. The data it collects is leaps and bounds better and more accurate than any other smart watch. This watch has way more than the average athlete would ever need as it pertains to fitness features. There are tons of apps available, and its so easy to navigate and customize to your need. I use it mainly for running, golf and open ocean canoe paddling, using the SUP app. Though it's a touch screen, it still responds decently well when you're using it on the water soaking wet. You just have to kinda dry it off before you try to navigate while on the water. But here's the deal, if you're truly serious about your training, you're probably working too hard to even mess with your watch during the workout anyway, so focus on your training, not tapping away at your watch. I set it to buzz after every mile so I can see each mile pace. It works well for the 5-10+ mile sessions when I'm trying to beat my time. I listen to music when I'm out paddling, and it's a really nice feature. Haven't had any issues connecting to my waterproof earphones, even with all the movement during a workout. I use the Mpow Flame waterproof earphones. Golf app is awesome: front, middle and back of the green yardage.4) Battery life - this is the biggest reason for me to get a Garmin instead of an Apple, Fossil or Samsung. I didn't want to be glued to my charger every night so instead I got this and get a full week's worth of battery. The always-on display is bright enough to see in daylight and at nighttime, but technology is what helps it save energy instead of the higher end amoled screens. It charges really quickly too so if I forget to charge it, I can just juice it up really quickly. A 10 minute charge gets me about 30% of battery.5) Smart features - The fact that Garmin has begun to integrate smart features to their watches is amazing. Yes, you can't do everything one would like to do on a watch like talk to siri, look at pictures, or make phone calls. But why are you looking on your watch for all that stuff anyway? Is it really necessary when our phones are so advanced now? I get all my selected phone notifications, I can read texts and preview emails, and that's really all i need. Remember, fitness first, smartwatch second.All in all, this is an amazing fitness watch, and I'd definitely recommend if you're in the market for a new watch. Totally worth the spend, and for my needs I'd say it is a major upgrade from the apple/samsungs."
830,Myx ,5,the United States ,1-Dec-22,"It’s a nice watch, good gift",I really appreciate getting this on a prime day deal. Husband is a guy who likes interesting watches. He never wanted a smart watch before but he likes this one. I am hoping it will help him detach from his phone a little bit.
831,JenH2020,5,the United States ,31-Oct-22,Highly recommend Garmin watch,"This is my first smart watch and I researched these products thoroughly. I chose this Garmin watch as it had all the features I was looking to monitor and I have not been disappointed. I am an avid lifelong walker and it’s wonderful to see the progress I’ve made since I purchased this watch. The price was markedly lower than other brands, the design is lovely, and it is a stunning piece. The watch is sturdy and very comfortable as I have tiny wrists and it is a perfect fit with the adjustable band. I highly recommend Garmin products which I have found to be of excellent quality and value."
832,CindyLouWho,5,the United States ,29-Nov-22,Fantastic watch,This Garmin has so many wonderful features.Most of all the fitness data helps to keep me motivated and feeling better.It is so much easier to keep up with phone calls by checking my wrist to see who is calling. Digging through my purse often is a disaster. Ha!
833,VMM,5,the United States ,18-Oct-19,Rock Solid and Attractive . . .,"I'm a watch dinosaur - I like automatic movements and the occasional quartz watch.  Have avoided the ""Smart Watch"" fad up til now.  But I've been wearing a Garmin VivoSmart fitness band with a regular watch  and was looking for something that could carry off both purposes at the same time . . . without looking like I'm wearing a smartphone on my wrist.  I'm also an Android phone guy so . . . adios Apple watch.  But that's OK.Look, if you're looking for a device  like this you have a choice: you can buy a true ""smartwatch"" with a bright and shiny display,  the ability to track your steps (Apple/Samsung), read your emails . .  and a crummy battery life.  Or you can buy a fitness devise with Smartwatch features . . . like a Garmin.I choose Garmin.  I bought the 40mm size because it looks like a regular watch and doesn't look goofy with dressier styles.  No, it doesn't have the bright AMOLED display like the Apples and Samsungs, but it does have the ""always on"" display which is easy to read in any light.  In dark areas, you can program it to brighten with a wrist snap or a tap.  Again, it's like a regular watch in that way - which for me is a must.  And yes, you can customize the face or download others with the Garmin IQ app.  Works fine for me.It's the fitness innards where Garmin really shines, and it tracks damn near every bodily function you have.  Steps is just the beginning.  Lots of pre-programmed workouts along with heart rate and Pulse Ox monitoring.  Garmin just buries the competition in the fitness arena, if that's important to you.Yes, you can read texts etc but . . . well, I have a phone for that.  No, I don't want to read emails on my watch.  The Garmin VA2 looks and acts like a real watch.  It's just smarter and the fitness stuff cannot be beat.  And the battery life buries the Apples and the Samsungs.  I get 2-3 days with just the basics on.If you don't care much about the fitness criteria and want a wrist display to parrot your phone . . . get thee to the Apple store.  Just make sure you bring your charger everywhere.  If you want a solid smart-ish watch that looks classy and is packed with health and fitness utilities . . . get the Garmin.No regrets here."
834,muse,5,the United States ,21-Nov-22,"Best mistake, you could not do worse.","Best mistake I have ever wasted money on, it died hard in 4 hour, we read everything and watched videos trying to make it work and it just died fully charged on and would not come back to life."
835,Dawn Salas,5,the United States ,3-Nov-22,Very happy with it.,I have had this for a few weeks now after switching from a fitbit and I really like it. I have not had any issues at all with the GPS tracking and I really like all the statists I get after a run/walk. It's also great to be able to calibrate when doing workouts on a bike or treadmill. I like that it is still has a feminine look and isn't bulky.
836,Ben Hudson,1,the United States ,24-May-22,"Sweat prevents heart rate monitoring, so not good for a fitness watch.","This watch is sized really well for smaller wrists and for those who prefer a smaller face. It would be a great watch if its advertised heart rate tracking worked correctly. If you wear the band too tightly it won't track heart rate. If you get a film of sweat between the sensor face and the watch it won't track. This means just when you get into the higher intensity part of your workout, it stops tracking. Or if you live in a humid area it will stop tracking as soon as you go outside and sweat a little.Their activity score seems to work pretty well to get me to work out consistently, but it's hard to want to continue when I only get half credit or less because the watch stops tracking in the middle of the workout because I sweat a little.I reached out to customer support and they sent me a replacement, but it didn't fix the issue. Then their email server started rejecting my replies as undeliverable.The notification support is tricky to set up but works pretty well once you get the four layers is permissions and settings configured correctly. Music control is spotty.GPS seems accurate but doesn't update very often so don't expect a lot of detail on your trips.Customized faces are nice and work well. I tend to get about 10 days on a charge with daily heart rate monitoring set at once per minute.The frustration of having the heart rate tracking stop working so often during working out even when I might not get that sweaty leads me to drop the rating to one star. I wear the watch just like they tell me and can't get any complete workout records. Basically useless unless all you want is a smart watch and don't care about workout tracking."
837,Edwards,1,the United States ,9-May-21,"Defective Item, charged a re-stocking fee","My fault to have this item for MORE than the 30 day return window. From day 1 it lacked proper battery life. We purchased 2 of these at the same time with the difference being the COLOR of the band. The other one, works beautifully. The app sucks, but the watch itself is great. This one however, the battery life lasts for a mere 3-4 days. We have taken our time to complete the restart, tried a few times. Followed all of the product support suggestions and lastly finally tried the hard factory reset. Once completed we charged this and the other one at the same time for the same amount of time. Both pulled off the chargers at the same time, all settings were exactly the same. in little more than 24 hours the pink band watch was at 96% battery life remaining. This black band watch was at 70% battery life remaining. Do you see the issue here? Defective product. So I contacted customer service which was an entire chaotic mess of awfullness. They accidentally started the return on the wrong watch, they cannot do replacements, so I had to contact back and the advisor was oblivious to the actual issue of just correcting WHICH watch the return was for. I asked for a supervisor 4 times and received nothing, so I had the customer service call me to explain and get this moving. Hallalejuh it was taken care of, only for me to find that they took a 30% restocking fee off of my refund. A refund I am receiving because they sold a DEFECTIVE product. What? Now I know what you are thinking, I was outside of my 30 day return period and I should have gotten in touch with them sooner. You are right, I should have, so I will suck up the ridiculous 30% and then likely purchase a different product with a service plan in case anything else happens. Not worth the crap I just went through on this bad boy. Don't buy it, or if you do, make sure it is perfect straight out that box!"
838,Caryl D.,1,the United States ,2-Oct-21,"does not work, return policy","I and my children bought this as a gift for my husband.  the directions for pairing the device did not work.  M husband found a work around.  After the first two attempts to pair the device, my husband checked their help page.  He followed the different suggestions and still did not work.  He then fill out a form to get help.  no reply.  After he found the work around for pairing, he updated the software on the watch.  He was adjusting the settings and found that some settings which he wanted to change were not allowed.  for example, change the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.  Also, the app would not allow changes to text notifications for the watch.  My phone's android version is compatible.  It is not the phone's problem.He decided he wanted to return the item because it was not working right.  Upon trying to return the item, I had to fill out the reasons why.  I filled out that is was not working as it should and when I submitted the return to the vendor through Amazon, where I bought it, It said that I cannot return and did not say why.  It said check their return policy which only said that it needs to be returned by October 26.  NO OTHER STIPULATIONS.Before you buy this watch, you better make sure it will work for you because you will be stuck with a watch that does not perform as you want and be out of quite a bit of money.UPDATE:  I was finally able to chat with an Amazon representative and will receive full refund."
839,Anonymous,1,the United States ,19-Mar-22,Don't waste your time,"Have had this for almost a year now, started out with the app on iPhone bc I figured it would work better than Android and it does but ended up with same result now I have a $100 watch bc the rest of it from day 1 has been trash, sleep tracking worked for a week before it just quit loading results, stress measurement (if you can get it to even read) is way off, blood pressure seems to be the most accurate of any other watch I've had but will only read about 1 out of every 10 times you take it, the only thing impressive was the battery life but even it is diminishing quickly with age but when it won't do anything else but give you the time that's not very much load for the battery. The o2 reading only reads about 1 out of every 10 times you try it. After getting completely frustrated I put the app on my android and was never able to get it to load sleep results and now the app says it's not connected but then I got into the Bluetooth settings and it says ""connected"".... I was very frustrated with other watches bc they were doing the same thing so I actually put some money into this thing bc I have a heart condition and need to keep up with what my heart is doing daily but after dropping $100 on this thing I absolutely refuse to by any other watch until I have a full year in on this thing, don't waste your time"
840,MGS,1,the United States ,6-Apr-22,How do I hate thee? Let me name the ways.,"From the beginning this purchase was a disaster. First there are NO instructions. None. Instead there is a code to scan. Might work if you have a modern phone with a built in scanner. I don't. Spent most of an evening trying to find a scanner then scan the code for the watch. Along the way I accidently downloaded some stuff I didn't want. Nowhere does it tell you that the app it wants is Zepp.This watch has a mind of its own. Although I have tried several times to change the watch face, it always eventually goes back to the same one. The one it apparently wants. It also determines when and when it will display information. I bought it mostly because I want to monitor heartrate while I'm doing my aqua exercises. Touch the face and you may or may not get heart rate.Unlike Santa, this watch doesn't know when I'm sleeping. Regardless of when I turn off the light and go to sleep, it takes at least an hour to recognize I'm asleep.Last, battery power. When I bought the watch I was pretty impressed. Now will barely hold charge a week.It also doesn't know when I'm walking. Once I forgot to turn off the walk when I was finished and left it on while I drove home. The watch believes I can walk eight miles at an average speed of 38 mph. I can't, and I can begin shopping for a watch that will let me be in charge."
841,Jonesy,1,the United States ,7-Dec-21,Locked out and can't get past software download screen,"Really annoyed with this device.  Used it for a couple weeks and all was fine, except I couldn't adjust the time without installing the App on my phone.  Got tired of always being off by an hour and installed the app.  Now the problems begin!  Was able to synch the device with the app initially.  Then the device kept asking me if I wanted to keep a certain home screen layout and presented me with a choice.  The choice was to DELETE the current home screen or not.  Very un-intuitive method of asking you, and if you clicked the check-box thinking ""Yah, keep it"" you actually deleted it.  Ugh!  Now, if you want to reinstate that home screen, you have to do it from the App.  Tried to push a home screen back into my device, and ended up freezing the device screen.  Tried everything to get it to come back to an interactive screen, but nothing worked.  Was able to get a factory reset option, and chose that.  Now I'm stuck with the software download screen as my only message from the device, can't move past this.  I've looked for ways to get back to the homescreen, but nothing seems to work.Wouldn't recommend this product to a friend or enemy!  Bought this off of treasure truck for a pretty cheap price, thinking it would be nice to have a watch that also counted steps.  Come to find it wants to manage my life.  Goes in the trash now."
842,Melanie,1,the United States ,8-Nov-22,Battery life is a joke!,"My major beef is the batter goes dead within three days, even with minimal use and the settings adjusted to reduce the screen brightness and minimize the auto read function.  The first one I bought worked better.  Also, they really should send two charger cables.  I wish they would use an industry standard USB C port instead.This is my second Amazfit watch.  I bought it because it had boxing as one of the exercises.  I box every day but this app was so hard to get to, I finally gave up trying.  The mobile app is not as robuse as my old fitbit from several years ago.  I am not willing to buy another since this one was such a letdown."
843,Amazon Customer,1,the United States ,2-Dec-22,Not accurate.,"This watch sometimes shows my pulse rate at twice the rate.  It might show 117 beats per minute, when my actual rate would be 56.  The blood pressure feature never shows a B/P over 120/80 even when blood pressure cuffs show a much higher B/P.  I was thinking my B/P was well under control when it was actually quite high.  I would not recommend this watch for anyone who is tracking their vital signs as it does not accurately reflect these measurements and leads to a false sense of everything being where it should be."
844,a.kerwin,1,the United States ,1-Jan-22,14 day battery life is a flat out lie.,"Over the last 2-3 years, I have purchased a few middle of the road priced watches, through Amazon, that definitely showed their lack in quality of materials and functionality - amazingly, just after each warranty expired....So, I decided to spend a bit more money so that my husband could have a decent watch, that would hopefully last at least a full 1-2 years. I purchased this watch in particular due the great reviews and ""14 day battery life"".  It's been a whole 5 days and he has already had to fully charge it twice!I'm not sure what to do at this point - 5 days out functionality (""bells/whistles"") seem to be fine, Truthfully it hasn't been long enough to figure out whether or not they will continue to work appropriately...but I'm incredibly DISAPPOINTED with the flat out lie of a ""14 day battery life"" that Amazon claims this watch has.I have spent about $300-350 on watches within the last few years....I guess I should just saved the $400 and got the ""extra fancy"" brand name watches.. I don't know how this will play out for me, but if your reading this, I guess I recommend to skip this watch and anything else under $100. Just buy the ridiculously overpriced brand named watch of your choice, NOT through Amazon."
845,Nic,1,the United States ,15-May-22,Buy something that will last,I have had this watch 5 days.Text message notifications no longer come through.The watch no linger lights up when i turn my wrist and look at.The sleep counter lumps up naps with sleep time. Not the same at all.Product support has several required fields to input before you can get support.Your firm ware.Your zepp idThe watch firm ware.The watch serial numberEtc  .Hope you have all that on hand to ask them why notifications have stopped.Or ask them any other simple question.I thought this watch was a deal..... now i realize its just another junk product.The pro is that it stopped working during the return time frame.The screen scratches very easily!And there are no adequate screen protectors for this product.Less than a week and it has a solid scratch right down the middle.This is not a scratch proof screen.I bought this product thinking i was getting a deal and saving money.Just pay the extra 50 bucks and get a scratch proof smart watch that actually works longer than a week.
846,Christopher,2,the United States ,2-Dec-21,Pretty disappointed with this thing.,"Update: 12/08/2021 - I received the replacement after a couple days, and I have to say this thing is pretty disappointing.The badThe notification function just straight up doesn't work, even after going step by step through the process outlined by the manufacturer and hours of troubleshooting it myself it never worked.The heart rate monitor is wildly inaccurate. I confirmed this by comparing it with my garmin fitness tracker.The ""extra"" faces you can download are little better than static images since you can't customize anything with them like you can with the two stock faces.The control interface for music/media was a bit flaky as well, only actually controlling my media intermittently. Meanwhile my garmin watch has no issues with this.The goodThis watch at least looks decent. Personally I hate the big bulky round smart watches and prefer the smaller square style like this one. This particular watch has a nice minimalistic and sleek appearance.It's decently comfortable with plenty of adjustability in the strap. The strap itself is smooth, soft silicone, so it should be easy to wear for most people.The app is fairly clear and straight forward, it's just a shame some of the features of this watch just refused to work for me.Overall, I can't recommend this watch. It has potential, but the flaws it has along with the potential for broken watches slipping past QC have lead me to return mine for a refund.Initial review:The product arrived broken, no discernable damages to the boxes or product.I bought this because I owned a bip quite some time ago and actually liked it so I figured I'd try this out.Not so impressed with the QC on this one. I've requested a replacement and will update my review once it arrives."
847,Frank,2,the United States ,4-Oct-22,Ok but unreliable,"I've had this device for a few months.  It works ok and is pretty basic.  It has several problems though.  Screen will just go black, especially in the morning and won't function for brief periods.  Heart rate monitoring while exercising is not at all accurate.  The only button is located directly on the side so if you do push-ups/planks it will hold the button down and cancel your workout tracker."
848,L,2,the United States ,4-Mar-21,It's a nice watch but it still needs minor adjustments.,"I've been using this smartwatch for almost two months now and I really like it. I like the way that it looks and I really like the AMOLED screen. I also like the sleep tracker, I think it works pretty well. However, the menstrual tracker doesn't work. I have tried to input my periods and it will erase the data or change the dates. It also frequently disconnects from my phone, this makes the weather disappear and then I can't see any of my data until I connect it again. The band irritates my wrist and smells really bad if you get it wet, so make sure to wash it from time to time. I also wish you could make custom watch faces because if you have an iPhone, you can't and are subjected to use whatever watch faces that are available through the Zepp app.I think a few updates will help with these issues. Other than that, I like it and I wear it everyday.UPDATE: Since my last review, I have had more time with this watch. They have put out maybe two updates since I left my review. The first update helped with the period tracker not working. The second update has pretty much ruined the app for me. I can't get into the Zepp app to do anything, it just keeps ""synching."" The weather widget has also started to not work anymore. I can't customize my watch or anything, this update has completely ruined the watch. I have tried to contact Amazfit and have gotten no response."
849,Matthew V Duong,2,the United States ,21-Mar-21,"Promising, but there's still a long way to go","This is my second watch from Amazfit; my first one was Stratos (1st edition) which was pretty good imo for the money.This GTS 2 mini is well-made, super light and battery life seems pretty good. However, . There are many app (Zepp) functions are still written in Chinese, which is pretty iffy for me to choose. . SpO2 function is very slow reading and should not be taken seriously. . Connectivity is a joke. Every time I open the app, the watch needs to sync with the app, the process which takes more than 30 seconds, every single time. . Connection between app and watch lose many times during the day. . Heart Rate is not accurate. One time, I was feeding my 6 month baby and the watch sounded an alert in which my heart rate was passed 140. I bet feeding a baby is not an easy job, but it should not that be stressful. . There is no health alert functions. . The maximum display for notification is only 7 lines. For a text should be fine, but for an email it is next to useless if you can only read 7 lines. . Alexa is next to nothing since most of the time "" the network is busy"", which I have no idea which network.I don't know if I should keep this, for $85 it sounds like it can do a lot for the money. However, doubling it will open many different doors to different products with better hardware, software. I hope Amazfit could roll out more update, fix, batch ... whatever which could address those issues."
850,M. Madura,2,the United States ,9-Nov-22,Disappointing...,Had really hoped this watch would more ‘accurately’ track my steps than others I’ve had...nope. So disappointed. I’ll keep the watch...I like the design and the fit...and it keeps the time just fine. Lol
851,mikek,2,the United States ,5-May-21,"3-5 days battery average, nothing close to advertised 15 days, sensors hit and miss","I got GTS2 minithe best part is the screen, which is OLED and clear to read notificationsthe good part is it's very light and comfortable to sleepwhat are not so good:1. battery drains in 1 day a extreme when all sensors, but GPS are asked to take measurements each minute2. battery drains in 3-5 days in normal use, where HWM asked for 10 min interval and Sleep assistance is on, walking for 30-60 min as activity once or twice a day that enables GPS and HRM3. HRM - hit and miss4, SpO2 - way out, especially at sleep times, ranges from 40% to100%. I'm not sure I can live when my SpO2 is below 80%, below 95% is already alarming, but 40%?5. original app software is way intrusive privacy wise, required access to a lot of personal info that streams back to CN servers to make solution work - this is trade off, issue for some and none issue for another. I don't use AmazFit app Zeep,, but use Notify for AmazFit app that stores locally on my phone.if you are Ok to have watch for notifications and alarms and 5 days battery life then it's for youif you look for sensors readings then it isn't the device, especially SpO2can this watch work for 15 days? maybe if all sensors are off and no notifications and screen is offthis isn't my use caseI'll see if I'll update my review in a week"
852,kristi mendler,2,the United States ,20-Sep-22,Watch will not stay synced to my phone,"I was enjoying the watch but it won’t stay synced with my phone, so no messages or calls. One reason I bought the watch was to see calls and messages while hiking and biking without pulling out my phone. Also the screen is too dark to read out in the sun, adjusting brightness doesn’t work. Pretty disappointed now."
853,Jesus O,2,the United States ,25-Nov-22,Heart rate bad while exercising,The heart rate would sometimes not work properly at all while exercising other than that it's decent.
854,Amazon Customer,2,the United States ,4-Sep-22,Overall it’s a decent watch but one flaw is disappointing,I like the watch overall. The battery life is very good.  I do a lot of cycling and the pause and auto pause seldom works. You have to use the pause button on the phone to actually work. Since this the part of the most important feature for me is why I gave it a low score.
855,KB,2,the United States ,6-Jun-22,Tiny Tiny Fonts - Highly Inaccurate BP and Weather,"Tried most of the watch faces and all of them use tiny (4pt or smaller) fonts for the statistics.  Weather was off by 20 degrees.  Checked the pulse against a blood oxygen meter had it was off by more than 30 points.  While they advertise swimming, it is not one of the measured activities.  No auto recognition of exercise.Stress test asks you wear the watch loose.  O2 test asks you to wear it tight.  Didn't try sleep test.  Can't speak for battery life as I'm returning it after one day.Too bad, because it is lightweight and comfortable to wear.  Looks nice too,  but I'm going back to a FitBIt Versa 2."
856,Curmudgeon10,3,the United States ,6-Nov-22,Jury Still Out!,"First, the initial ""pairing:""  I charged the watch and then pressed the button, and up came a QR Code, which I scanned.  This installed something called ""ASOS"" on my phone, which has nothing to do with the watch.  It is some sort of clothing marketing site.  I deleted ASOS, and then looked on the inside cover of the small but thick instruction book included with the phone.  Another QR code, which I scanned.  This installed an App called Amazefit (or something very close to that), which needed ""updates.""  The first update took two minutes to install, but then reported ""fail.""  Another update then presented itself, this one taking NINE minutes to install.  The progress circle never quit spinning, but eventually I got a Completed notification by shutting down the app and/or rebooting the phone (don't remember exactly which one).  But now the phone showed two different icons, both named Amazefit.  Without going into every gory detail, I could not get either of these apps to pair with the watch.  I even made sure to ""remove"" my old Bluetooth watch from the phone, and physically move it out of Bluetooth range.  Finally, I looked at the booklet again and spotted below the QR Code: ""Download Zepp App.""  I went to the app store, and there it was.  It worked; phone now paired with watch.Observation: this watch has MANY features.  There really is no documentation explaining them, but if you spend enough time just playing with the watch you can figure out MOST of them.Observation: you must establish a ""free"" account to use the app with the watch.  There are some conditions (as yet not run down, specifically) that cause one to be signed out of the account without your knowledge or notification.  This means when opening the app to check data, you must sign in again.  Amazefit or Zepp or whoever you are: this is VERY ANNOYING.Observation: for unknown reasons (I'm guessing at the moment due to having phone out of blue tooth range), your phone can become unpaired with the watch, even when the two are back in range of each other.  My effort to re-pair them doesn't work (""Connecting"" spins forever). until I reboot my iPhone SE.  This is VERY ANNOYING.Observation: when the app notifications work, I really like them.  Text is easily read on the watch face, and there is almost no lag.  HOWEVER, for as yet undetermined reasons, when the watch is paired and everything appears to be working normally, notifications stop.  You can check all the ""settings"" etc. on both watch and app, and all appears normal and just as it was while Notifications were working.  I've been able to restore them by cycling the phone bluetooth off and on.  This is another ANNOYING drawback (UPDATE: yesterday, I received a notification that a software update was available that fixed a problem with IOS 16 -- notifications would stop.  I installed it: So far so good).As far as accuracy of measurements, everything looks good.One final note: there is a facility within the phone to report bugs and desired improvements back to the manufacturer.  I used it to ask how I could be ""permanently signed in.""  I got back a robo response that Amazefit appreciated my idea for a product enhancement."
857,eb,3,the United States ,2-Aug-21,GTS 2 Mini,"I wear smartwatches for abilities of seeing time, notifications, and controlling my music.  Fitness and step tracking aren't important to me even though I am active and workout on a daily basis.I'll start with my pet peeves:1.  Always on display rarely works.  I have seen it work so I know it does.  It just does not work often, which is pretty bad because it's one of the features that's featured on the box.  I have faith in Amazfit that this will be fixed in a future update.2.  Tapping the screen does not wake the screen.  This may not be a big deal to many but for some reason it is to me.  It's mildly annoying to have to push the side button to wake the screen.  Again I have faith this will be fixed in an update.3.  No pre-setup response options to text messages.  This IS AVAILABLE for received PHONE CALLS, but not for text messages.  Hopefully option will be added in an update.4.  You can only have 4 watch face options readily available, worst part is 2 of them you don't have the option to change or get rid of.  Again, hopefully will get fixed.5.  Lack of options of watch faces.  There are quite a few available in the app, but there's only one app in the play store that have faces available for the GTS 2 Mini.  And that one app takes a bit to master.  I really don't fault the watch or the maker for this issue because the watch is still pretty new and more faces will be available over time.What I love:1.  The size and feel.  I've been intrigued by another watch line made by a fruity company because of its size, but I'm an android guy.  Plus I refuse to pay that much mullah for a smartwatch.  This is the closest to its size I've found that doesn't come with a crappy app that won't drain your phone battery.  This watch is super light and feels and looks great on my scrawny bony wrist.  I also bounce back and forth with my Asus Zenwatch 2 and a Ticwatch C2+.  The Zenwatch is HUGE and clunky, but I still wear it because the screen still is a great quality and I like the Wear OS.  I wear the Ticwatch at times because it's round and it's snappier than the Zenwatch, plus it's quite a bit smaller.2.  Screen.  I really didn't have high expectations for the screen quality.  I watched many videos on this watch before I bought it and the videos didn't do this screen justice.  It really is fantastic!  One other reviewer mentioned how easily it can scratch and I can see that.  However I am not hard on my smartwatches.For the price you really can't go wrong with the GTS 2 Mini!UPDATE:  Downgrading my review one more star because the sleep tracking is pitiful.  Occasionally I like to track my sleeping and I decided to try the Mini.  It stinks.  Couldn't be much more inaccurate. Either says I'm awake half the night or I went to bed way later than I actually did.  I have a Garmin Vivosmart 4 and that tracks sleeping pretty darn accurate.  Unlike the Mini.Also, it appears you have to wear the watch at just the right position on your wrist at just the right pressure for the different sensor readings to work.  I wear the watch in a casual/normal position on my wrist.  The heartbeat monitoring DOES appear to work sometimes because I do get readings at times.  So there is that.Bottom line, if you are a hardcore health monitoring nut I would recommend paying more $ for something that's more accurate.  This is one of those items where you pay cheap for health monitoring you get cheap.  Thankfully I have this watch for basic uses only and I still like having it.Update:  I found out that if you have the always on working to set a schedule it WILL WORK the whole time of that set schedule.  I used to have it set to ""always on"" and it worked part of the time sporadically.  It would light up at night while in bed and it bugged me so I set it be always on during a set schedule and now it always works during that schedule."
858,David B,3,the United States ,6-Nov-22,Great except for sleeping tracking,"The only problem I have is don't track when you get up or wake up at night. So when fall asleep, if you wake up or get up for a few hours then go back to sleep it counts it all as sleep. It also has never picked up when I nap during the day. My old smart watch pick up spooky accurate.Only holds a charge 4 to 5 days.Other than that is a great watch. This is my first with GPS for workouts and I love it.So it's an OK watch that would be great if they fix the sleep monitoring problems."
859,Hummingbird,3,the United States ,18-May-21,Overall it is a C.,"This is my second Amazfit watch.  It may have been a mistake to buy from Amazfit again but time will tell.  My first Amazfit watch (BipS) lasted about 18 months and then the battery quickly died going from lasting 14 days regularly to lasting about 3 days overnight then lasting for less than a day to lasting about a minute.The GTS 2...  First, the good.  The battery life is fantastic!! I used to get about 14 days on my previous Amazfit BipS.  I am averaging about 10 days on the GTS 2.  That is my primary reason for trying another Amazfit product.  No other brand seems to be able to come close to the battery life that the Amazfit watches have.  The watch face is bright enough to see outside but is NOT trans-flective like the BipS was. The watch comes with a decent number of sport modes.  Sleep tracking seems to be decent and data does get sent to the Zepp app onyou phone or tablet.Now the rest...  As mentioned the BipS would reflect sunlight to backlight the face.  The GTS 2 is simply bright enough to see in the sun but not near as visible as the BipS trans-flective face was.  Like the BipS (and unlike my wife's FitBit), the GTS 2 takes a l-o-n-g time to get a GPS signal.  This was something Amazfit touted was improved in the GTS 2.... eh, not so much.  Within a few days the watch started complaining about being low on memory whenever starting an activity and suggests syncing.  I sync and sync and still get this error every time I start an activity without fail.  If you open the Zepp phone app, and there is an update ready, the watch will perform a system update immediately regardless of what you may be in the middle of.  ""No soup for you!"".The Zepp app is not that intuitive.  How do you start an activity in Zepp on the phone?  A menu option like Home or Enjoy or Profile?  Nope.  There is an unlabeled gray bat across the bottom that one has to slide up.  Even then the only options for activities in this screen are Running walking and Cycling.The bottom line is that IF you want long battery life in he smart watch field, you will need to compromise.  I'm taking swing #2 with Amazfit.  If I have battery problems again then I will be done with Amazfit and hopefully some other company has gotten their device to last more than a week by then (hello? Fitbit?)."
860,Joanna D.,3,the United States ,8-Nov-22,Disappointing,I bought this item because it claimed that it would work with Alexa- it doesn’t.I thought because it’s new it would have the latest features- it doesn’t even automatically change from daylight savings time like my fitbit does.Not sure of the sleep tracking- it seems to count being in bed as sleep.Battery life is decent.I like the large readable font.
861,Lux123,3,the United States ,21-Nov-22,Looks cute and elegant,"All of a sudden the watch went in to dark mode and app wasn’t working either , not sure of how far this this work, so I returned it."
862,C.,3,the United States ,17-Mar-22,"Great, but two issues.","Owned an Amazfit Band 5 and loved all the features.  Decided to upgrade.The GTS Mini is designed that is more of a comfort for me to wear, easy to read screen, great over all.  However, after wearing it a couple of days I noticed with app notifications:1.  Emails do not list the name of the sender2.  Calendar does not list event name, only timeMy phone and settings were all up to date, and I was surprised these features were on the Band 5, but lacking on the GTS Mini.  Contacted customer service.  Amazfit replied to my question concerning the calendar app::::To be honest, due to the limited storage of the watch, a limited amount of communicating applications such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger support showing complete notification details including app icon, sender's name, message content on the watch. For those non-communicating applications such as the Calendar app you mentioned, part of the notification details would be missing. Hope you understand!:::All of this was on the 30$-40$ band, but now, the ""upgrade"" of 80$-90$ an essential feature is missing.I am looking at other models now, but am wary of buying anything as----this should be clear on the description.  Searching reviews deeper, I now see this as a problem for others.  Perhaps a firmware update is in the future?  Considering a return because of this."
863,Buckybuck,3,the United States ,25-Sep-21,It's okay and cheaper than Apple,"Overall, I’m okay with the watch, but there are some quirks I’ll point out. First is claimed battery life. You might get 14 days if you turn the watch’s display off and shove it in a dark drawer for two weeks. But real world use is gonna be more like 4-5 days.The Alexa integration is kinda impressive and actually works most of the time, but I don’t get the point. For it to work, the watch has to be within Bluetooth range of your phone and your phone has to have the Alexa app on it. Is it really that onerous a task to simply pull your phone out of your pocket and access Alexa that way?The built-in GPS also has me scratching my head. It works (at the expense of battery life) but what’s the point? I’ve noticed that if you use the watch itself to start tracking an activity like walking, running, or cycling, it uses the watch’s built-in GPS to monitor distance and location. However, if instead you start tracking from your phone’s Zepp app, it uses the phone’s built-in GPS to monitor distance and location. I guess using the watch’s built-in GPS would be handy if you don’t have your phone on you, but how often are you gonna be somewhere and not have your phone with you? Maybe swimming, but I can’t imagine any other circumstance when I wouldn’t have both my watch and my phone on me.Finally, it’s neat that you can switch watchfaces, but I wish there were an easy way to design and make your own. Also, a couple of the watchfaces available on the Zepp store will let you switch out or replace data fields on the watchface (so you can display weather trends rather than heart rate, for example), but most of them don’t. Currently, there’s nothing in the store descriptions to let you know which watchfaces do or don’t have editable data fields, so you have to upload the watchface to find out. Put it in the descriptions or, better yet, make all the watchfaces editable."

866,Bertie Ruth Gordon,4,the United States ,17-Nov-22,Second Time Around,"This is the second time I have bought the Amazfit watch.  Bought my first pair 4 and 1/2 years ago (for my husband and myself)  When they started acting up I came back and got another pair.  I like the improvements over the older ones we had.  The app that goes with the watch is easier to use than the old one.  I like the fact that it can track more than one thing like steps, heart rate, oxygen, sleep  and stress levels among other things.  A very good product for a reasonable price if you are wanting a fitness watch with out extra bells and whistles.  I am 63 and my husband is 72 so we are not super up on tech but these watches are easy to use and understand."
867,Blaire,4,the United States ,4-Nov-22,Battery=AMAZING.  Answer call=DOESNT WORK,"Bought for my husband: he has never had an Apple Watch, so got this to try out and see if he liked it first. It has a sleek design, battery life lasts almost 3 weeks without charging!!! and yes, it is WATERPROOF!You can see who is calling and see text messages, but even hooked to Bluetooth, you cannot answer a call or text back on it. That was a bummer for me, but my husband couldn’t care less. (ha!) He loves this watch, especially the fact that the charge lasts so long. If he had to take it off to charge every couple days, he wouldn’t wear it.He has worn it to shower every night (for over a month now,) and also works around water, and watch is fine. I’d give waterproof a 10/10. It counts his steps pretty accurately too."
868,JARED W. DIEFFENBACH,4,the United States ,1-Dec-22,Workout Menu is Lacking,"Overall I'm happy with the watch and it's functions but very disappointed in the lack of some workout selections. My most active hobbies are pickleball, kayaking, bicycling, racquetball, and walking. There are no selections for kayaking, racquetball, or pickleball. The closest thing to pickleball is badminton. How many people really play badminton? There's not even a selection for tennis, which would come close to pickleball. How can it be that tennis isn't one of the selections? I didn't return the watch but wouldn't buy it again for these reasons."
869,Jamal M.,4,the United States ,5-Nov-22,Battery life is amazing,"People think it's an apple watch which it is not, it has a way better battery life as I charge it once every 10 day vs my wife who charges her Apple watch every 1.5 days.  The only thing is the band causes me to break out so I purchased a metal band replacement here on Amazon which took care of that issue.  For 50 bucks it's a good little smart watch."
870,Benyamin C.,4,the United States ,9-Nov-22,Great look and functionality at a very good price.,"The product meets the spec. The way ch faces are beautiful and include an Always on option. The connection and pairing was easy through the app. The form factor is not bulky. And it fully supports Hebrew - both in the UI and messaging display. All in all, great purchase!"
871,Erik,4,the United States ,11-Sep-22,Very good watch,"I bought a TicWatch GTH and really liked it's simplicity, but it started having problems and it didn't seem like anyone there wanted to come up with a solution. It mainly didn't like recording my exercise correctly.So I came across this watch and the only thing missing was body temperature which wasn't important to me. Battery life is similar and so far seems to be about 10 days. The built-in GPS is really nice and has worked perfectly. And there's lots of great watch faces to choose from. The interface with the app has been very good (no sync problems and stays up to date) and the app hasn't negatively affected my phone's battery life. And the app looks good with pleasing graphics and graphs.My only complaint is the app is disorganized and things are scattered. I've spent a lot of time tapping randomly through different screens to try and find basic things."
872,Rita,4,the United States ,22-Oct-22,Watch,It was a gift and appreciated.  I have no idea how it works.
873,anthony,4,the United States ,24-Mar-21,"Nice Watch, for the price","Nice smart watch that  meets most of my expectations.  I have been a long time Pebble user, I had the original, then moved to the pebble 2. i needed a new watch  after using the pebble 2 died after about 4 years of use. With that in mind I had a few requirements for the replacement. 1 - Needed to have long battery life, 2 - something cheap enough I wouldn't worry about damaging it in daily use. 3 - prefer a small and minimal/discrete watch. I'm happy to say this meets all those Expectations. no visible branding is an extra plus. obviously it is not a $500 smartwatch, you will be trading off for some quality and some odd quarks with the software.A few annoyance/ observations after  month of use: Not a huge selection of simple watch faces in the app, many either display much information for my daily watch, or are just over the top and annoying to look at. not sure who even uses the majority of the watch faces they offer at the moment.  Currently using a sideloaded watch face, but would like more support form the manufacturer, it seems the GTS and GTS 2 have many more styles.It would be 1000 % more comfortable if the watch was entirely made of metal, the high gloss plastic back material, gets stuck to my skin, making the watch feel tighter than it is. for this reason alone i would consider the GTS2. maybe this is a personal thing, but i suspect many people feel the sameI use this watch with Android, the notification generally work as expected. however I often notice getting double or triple notifications if I am using my phone, this can get pretty annoying.  Another feature that would be nice is if you could separately control the screen timeout after a notification. after a notification i don't immediately look at the watch, and by the time i look the screen is already off, making it a hassle to wake the watch and swipe up to view all notifications.I don't generally plan to use this while working out, however i do play golf regularly in the summer, would be nice if they added golf as a workout. even better would be to add a golf app for using the gps to measure yardages like a Garmin.  to my knowledge the watch currently doesn't function for golf.Overall this watch is a great value, i would highly recommend for the extra money over the Bip U or Bip S"
874,JohnE,4,the United States ,13-Aug-22,Nice watch but you need to know what you’re looking for.,"After using a FitBit for years I finally switched to the Apple Watch. I exercise daily and the cardio tracking on the Apple Watch is much better than the FitBit.  For sleep tracking the FitBit is better. There are apps like NapBot to download for sleep tracking. I understand Apple has new sleep tracking software coming out in Fall. Being able to answer a phone call on you watch is a cool feature. Buyer beware, the big downside to the Apple Watch is the battery, it’s awful. You have to recharge the battery every morning if you use the watch for sleep tracking."
875,Amazon Customer,4,the United States ,26-Jul-22,Started working again.,So I thought my watch died on me but I was wrong! This watch went dark for a day then came back to life! My daughter helped me figure it out. It does everything it’s supposed to do. I bought it mostly to monitor my sleep and it does a great job for that . I’m not sure if my steps are 100% accurate. It only got 4 stars because I now have a rash on my wrist do to the watch strap. I have to take the watch off half a day to help cure the rash. So I mostly wear at night to sleep and monitor. Overall good purchase and less money spent.
876,dodd9702,5,the United States ,18-Apr-22,Happy with this smartwatch!,"After going through three Fitbits that have died on me after a year, I decided to try another brand of smart watch.  While I would love an Apple Watch, the need to charge every day is not ideal.  I don't want to have to add charging my watch each day to the many other things I have to remember to do.  So, I decided to try this Amazfit GTS 2 Mini. It is among the thinnest and lightest of smart watches, and I didn't want anything bulky on my arm.I'm really happy with it so far!  It has taken about four days to really play with it and understand all that it can do.  For instance, today, i just discovered that I can create customized watch faces.  I thought I was stuck with the pre-made ones in their watch store.  This really makes me feel like I can make the watch very personalized to me.I really like the long battery life.  I also like how immediately and quickly it syncs.  It used to take my old fitbits FOREVER to sync. I love that I can customize the shortcuts to only see the features I want in the order I want.  I love that I could customize the app to hide the features I won't use and put the features I will use in the order in which I want to see them.  I really like the countdown app, the cycle tracker, the meditation breathing,  the sleep tracking, the heart rate monitor, step tracker, the weather (although it could be more self-explanatory), the ability to control sound and move forward/backwards when playing music, podcasts, or other audio from my iphone.My favorite feature is that I can have a plain digital clock display with the date, day, and steps when the screen is off.  That was the feature that sold me on the watch!The screen is also beautiful.  The band is quite plain-looking relative to the beauty of the watch, but I'm just ordering a nicer band to put on it.I got all of these many new features in a device that still cost much less than what I was paying for those Fitbits!!I'm giving it four stars only because I had a few glitches that I hope won't become long-term issues.  One issue was that some of the notifications weren't coming through.  However, after restarting and changing a setting on my phone, it has been back to working fine.  The other issue was that after a day or two the digital clock was not displaying when the screen was off.  I'm not sure if that was a watch system issue or if I have a setting somewhere that was not configured properly.It does have Alexa (to provide text-based responses), but I disabled it.  It only seemed to work when you have the Zepp app open on the phone.  Doing that would get so cumbersome that it would defeat the purpose of having it readily available on the watch.Overall, I am very happy with this watch!UPDATE:  I'm actually bumping to five stars.  I am so much happier with this watch than my old Fitbits.  The screen is gorgeous.  I realized that I wasn't getting the digital screen-off clock because the watch turns it off when it thinks I'm sleeping.  After I wake and get moving, it starts displaying again.  Neat! The displays of notifications are still unclear to me, and it can't get the weather for the exact place where I live (only for the next county over).  Still, I'm really happy with this watch given its price and the other options out there on the market. I notice that I'm using the meditation/breathing bubble app quite often!SECOND UPDATE: They need a better instruction manual for this watch.  Just when I think I had discovered all that it can do, I come across other features that I didn't know about.  I didn't realize that all of the watch faces can come with their own screen off watch faces.  Also, the watch faces you customize have their own bare bones screen off watch face (so that you can get the color of text you want for the screen off face). Being able to customize the screen off watch face has been awesome!  I also had not understood the ""lit when wrist lift"" setting.  I now have that off, which is what I prefer.  Realizing these functions saves battery life and helps me customize the watch even more to my style and liking.  As for battery life, in the first week, I got a little over four days of battery life on a full charge. However, I was playing with it a lot and I had not realized how to use the ""lit when lift wrist"" function.  Now that I turned off the ""lit when lift wrist function,"" I'm getting longer battery life. Even happier with my watch!"
877,Happy Mom,5,the United States ,4-Dec-22,Great value,"I got this as an upgrade from my Fitbit HR because I wanted the GPS and the O2 readings.  It has been a great watch so far, and I've had it a few months.  The battery is long lasting and easy to charge.  The sleep tracking works well.  The GPS is accurate.  It has a lot more choices for types of workout than my old watch.  I really think it is a great watch for the money.  The app, however, was a little less intuitive to me than I would like.  But that's really the only thing that was not an improvement to me."
878,Ravi,5,the United States ,14-Nov-22,Just incredible,"This is my second Amazfit and my favorite.  It's packed with features!My favorite things.1. Tons of other faces available on other apps.2. You can prevent the watch from lighting up during sleep hours.3. The vibration is strong. I've had to return other smart watches because the vibration wasn't strong enough to wake me up. This one does the trick every time!4. The countdown feature is very helpful when working out to track time between sets. Instead of looking at my watch or a clock, I just said it to vibrate after 1 minute of rest and the second I feel that vibration I hit the next set.Things I don't like1. When it says you can control music, keep in mind that does not include Spotify.2. Wish it had Samsung or Apple pay3. The calorie tracker is awful.Still highly recommend!"
879,Kindle Customer,5,the United States ,4-Nov-22,Love this watch!,"After returning 3 watches, I finally found my perfect match.  This watch was very easy to program.  This watch is light and very comfortable for a small wrist (the band is on the last hole).  This watch is perfect for tech-challenged individuals.  It is easy to program and easy to access the menu by pressing the stem twice unlike other watches that required several swipes and taps.  This watch also has a Free Exercise selection that records heart rate and calories for multiple activities for 1-hour gym workout instead of individual workouts (ex. bicycling, running, elliptical).  It has several different faces that are easy to access by holding the screen down and sliding back and forth to your choice.  The downside is that QR Codes were not very specific so I had to search the internet for an operating manual to access several features.I"
880,M.K.,5,the United States ,29-May-21,Don't waste your money or your time--UPDATE,"Had a Garmin Vivoactive for 18 months, then a software upgrade from Garmin corrupted the cpu in the watch. Replacement fom Garmin took 8 weeks. Poor customer service, especially since they knew they had an issue.Decided to try this Amazfit watch. The price was good, more features than Garmin & touted better battery life. Had to charge Garmin every 3 days. So far I get 7 days before need to recharge.So far really happy. Works well, app is more informative than Garmin, teaching me how I can adjust some activities to better suit me. I highly recommend this samrt watch.UPDATE!! Buyers beware!! THe watch began to have problems within 3 months of receipt. I went to charge the watch as usual, however the screen would not turn on so I pressed the button on side & nothing happened. Went to Amazfit site, called Customewr service, left message. No call back. Sent email, got robot return email. 2 days later I call again, put on hold for 20 minutes than a rep comes on. I describe issue, I hear typing, then he tells me have to uninstall Zepp app, then hold down watch button between 30 & 60 seconds. When Screen appears, then reload Zepp app, Reset watch to original settings. Of course I lost all historical data. Device worked fine for 2 more charges, then the  same thing happens. I now know the drill, do exactly the same, reset the device & all data lost again. I send another email asking if there were any known 'bugs' on software. Response I got back was to 'send a screen shot'. OF A BLANK SCREEN? What good would that do? I replied to email with similar response, then can another robot email with jibberish to reset watch.Finally, I called Amazon Support & got Mike. WOW, was he helpful. He pulled up info on the device, read the exact same instructions as I got from Amazfit. When I told hime I already did that, he apologized (it was real) then said he wanted to some research & call me back on Monday. Boy was he prompt, first thing Monday fro Uraguay there was Mike. His research found that MANY other buyers of the device had the same issue, going back at least 6 months. I asked how many & he said he couldn't tell me but said I was not alone & the seller of the device knew. Thanked him & proceeded to contact, via email Amazfit, requesting an exchange since device was still within 1 year warranty. I took 3 days for a response to come along with a USPS label atteched to use to return device to their California office.. So the next day I went to the PO, bought a cushioned envelope & sent it off. Now 5 days have passed, they acknowledged that they knew package was sent, YET 5 days later no replacement. I only live about 15 miles from their California facility so distance across the ocean is not a factor.BUYERS BEWARE. When the device warks it is really decent & does what it is suppossed to do. If it's a softe=ware bug they need to fix that. If it's a hardware issue they need to replace or repair all the GTS2 minis'. Not an easy decison to make. Software is cheaper tp fix. Hardware flaws can put a big dent inthe business."
881,NateNBeckie,5,the United States ,11-Oct-22,Features may be basic but it's super robust,"I just use my watches as time keepers, step counters, and for text notifications.  I don't use all the cute bells and whistles that most come with.  For my uses, it does exactly what I need it to do.  That said, this watch has outlasted any Apple watch I have had and a Fossil.  I'm really hard on my watches.  I work with my hands, and I work hard.  It's got welding pock marks all over the face, a few scratches, and has just taken a beating.  It's been stuck and crushed more times than I can remember.  The touch screen still works flawlessly.  The band broke a few months ago so I replaced it.  Still no problems with the watch itself.  Given the kind of life it's had, it is far better than any watch at 4x+ the price.  The app is decent too.  I have no complaints there.  I will buy another Amazfit when this one goes."
882,Jan Andrejco,5,the United States ,8-Oct-22,A great purchase,"I had been using FitBit for several years (had about 3 of them).  I did not want to pay the price of an Apple Watch but wanted a step up from what I had at a reasonable price.  The sleep tracking on this is much more accurate.  It looks good.  I have used several functions (alarm, exercise, Alexa -although I don’t have that perfected, steps, heart rate, camera mode, to-do-list, find phone, weather, turning my screen face off while I sleep) and all have worked very well.  I found it best to use a YouTube video for the set up.  I recommend it for the price.  I lowered my rating on the battery but it is likely that my usage is far above the average.  It is still 100% better than what I had.  I charged it Wednesday afternoon and it still have 51% battery life left (today is Saturday)."
883,Rosa Vasquez,5,the United States ,4-Dec-22,Buen regalo,Este fue un regalo para mi cuñado y le encantó mucho🤗
884,Trey Franey,5,the United States ,26-Nov-22,Good sleep tracker,Alexa often un links which is annoying when your entire house was a smart house… besides that great for steps and sleep tracking bpm
885,ALVARO RODRIGUEZ,5,the United States ,16-Nov-22,Cool watch,"I'm still learning about my newt watch, but so far it's a good buy. I could not find tennis within the list of supported sports and the Alexa function is not that friendly."
